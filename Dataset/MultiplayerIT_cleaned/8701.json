{"name": "MotorStorm RC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100013-motorstorm-rc-tempesta-di-macchinine.html", "text": "It is an indisputable truth that the success of smartphones, and of Apple devices in particular, substantially influences the market for portable consoles. Where the goal is to relax for a few minutes during a train or bus journey, or while waiting in line at the general practitioner, the iPhone on duty does the damn job, in the face of ridiculously low prices for the software. The goal of Sony and Evolution Studios, with the creation of MotorStorm RC is therefore to field a product capable of encompassing the best of both worlds: a decidedly low purchase price, or 5.99 euros; the cross-platform nature, which allows you to download the same software even on PlayStation 3 despite having paid for it only once; a technical sector adequate to the capabilities of the new console; an overflowing amount of content, in this case forty-four events that are unlocked (along with new vehicles) as we earn new medals. Once the game has started, we are immediately launched onto the track to adjust the control system, in this case making the steering of the radio-controlled car relative to the car itself or to the screen. The default commands see the two analog sticks assigned precisely to the steering and to the accelerator / brake combination, which proves to be the best solution from the point of view of sensitivity (dosing the acceleration becomes fundamental in certain cases), but if desired, it is possible to modify every single button, assign accelerator and brake to the back or main keys and, in general, modify all the parameters in order to obtain the experience that is closest to our style and sensitivity as possible. Batteries that don't wear out The main menu of MotorStorm RC allows us to view the models unlocked in the ~collection~ section (there are eight classes, each with different characteristics on the track), access the ~festival~ mode races, try our hand at single events (time attack and free play) in the ~fun~ section and finally test any car in the special ~playground~. The ~festival~ represents the fulcrum of the game, refers to the spectacular event on which the MotorStorm franchise is historically based and pays homage to it by inserting four scenarios that reflect the locations of the episodes of the series published so far in graphic style: Monument Valley, Pacific Rift, Arctic Edge and Apocalypse. Each of these settings contains eleven races, divided into four categories: Race, in which the winner is simply whoever crosses the finish line first after three laps of the track; Hot Lap, where we race against ghosts and have the ability to infinitely improve our lap time, accepting the result when we see fit; Pursuit, which rewards our performance if we manage to complete a certain number of overtakings within a time limit; Drift, based solely on points earned by continuously drifting the car. The ~rewards~ structure, which allows us to access new races only when we have collected a certain number of coins, makes the action rather varied as it is impossible to become stuck on a single scenario or on a particular type of vehicle. From this point of view, the similarities with the excellent DrawRace 2: Racing Evolved for iPhone and iPad are evident, which uses the same coin system to unlock new events and shares the starting setting and general atmosphere with MotorStorm RC also , in the case of the little gem developed by RedLynx, the basic gameplay is different. Playstation 3 trophies MotorStorm RC contains twenty-four trophies, with eight more being added via DLC. Some are obtained by earning gradually greater quantities of medals (twenty-four, forty-eight, ninety-six), others by establishing particular lap times within certain tracks. There are ~specialist~ trophies that are obtained by completing complex maneuvers, such as scoring two thousand points in a single drift. Car customization also plays its part in unlocking achievements, as does completing the 'playground' and gaining access to all four of its areas. One more game! The MotorStorm RC experience is therefore fast, immediate and fun, it ~wears out~ within a minute or drags on for hours, depending on the time we have available and our desire to respond to the challenges that the notification system it continually throws us, taking inspiration from the Autolog series Need for Speed to show us the results obtained by our friends on a particular track, which we may not have memorized properly yet and on which we are not very competitive. The ability to publishand on Facebook, a victory that has just been achieved is just the icing on the cake of a well-integrated and functional structure, which however lacks an important element to achieve excellence: online multiplayer. The fact that this feature has not been implemented seems inexplicable, given the prerogatives of the game and the emphasis placed on comparing one's results with those of friends and users scattered around the world. And if we then want to find a second criticality (hello, Tanzen) to the Evolution Studios product, we can safely say that, in purely technical terms, some more effort had to be made to make the frame rate stable, considering that in the default view ( dynamics) there are also quite significant dips when there are many toy cars on the screen. If Sony wants to focus on technological superiority to push gamers to buy PlayStation Vita, publishing a game with simple graphics like MotorStorm RC and not even holding up to 30 fps is not a great move.", "date": "2012-03-05", "grade": "8.5"}
