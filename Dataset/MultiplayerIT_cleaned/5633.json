{"name": "Diablo 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diablo-4-recensione.html", "text": "Diablo 4 deserved an in-depth examination: as we wrote in our preliminary review of the campaign, Diablo's endgame is about sharing and comparison and we also wanted to understand how Blizzard would move a few days after its release, as soon as the game was in hand to the most shrewd and experienced players. So, here we are: we've started the game all over again - this time in the role of a Druid - and we've stripped the endgame, that is, the contents that open up after the end of the campaign and which represent, in a certain sense, the beating heart of Diablo 4. Reconfirming our very positive judgment of the latest Blizzard effort, in this review of Diablo 4 we will talk above all about the endgame and its value, but first it is worth making some clarifications. A few words about the Diablo 4 campaign The final stages of the campaign are truly engaging In summary: we liked the Diablo 4 campaign, net of some shortcomings. It's an adventure in six acts, therefore also quite long, which leads us to explore Sanctuary with a certain margin of freedom, proposing multiple objectives that we can often pursue in the order we prefer. It tells a dark and bloody story, which sees us follow in the footsteps of Lilith, the daughter of Mephisto who is corrupting the inhabitants of Sanctuary, a world she created together with the angel Inarius. While not shining for originality, the plot of Diablo 4 captures the attention with a good level of writing, an excellent dubbing in the Italian version and an interesting cast that includes new characters and old acquaintances who wink at fans of the series. We particularly appreciated some supporting characters, especially the Horadrim who represent three different generations of heroes: the old Lorath, the stoic Donan and the tenacious Neyrelle. Their stories are engaging and articulate, and intertwine intelligently with the player's quest. The other supporting actors, on the other hand, are much more evanescent, often limited to the subplots of the act of duty, and the same can be said for the antagonists, whose motivations remain confused and opaque until the end. As mentioned, Diablo 4 does not have a real ending. The current campaign closes satisfactorily, but refers in a not too veiled way to future updates with which Blizzard will continue the story: some narrative junctions remain pending, as well as the destinies of various characters. Despite this, and a couple of subdued central acts that fill up and artificially lengthen the narrative, we feel we can promote a campaign that is certainly better written and narrated than that of Diablo III. The moments of prolonged exposure that slow down the pace in some situations demonstrate at the same time an important dedication to world building and characterization, which was important to get right in the economy of a title that must be able to live even only from this: although the endgame is the heart of Diablo 4, there is a percentage of players who will stop at the campaign without delving into the subsequent contents much. In this sense, Diablo 4's campaign works and future updates are an effective way to bring players back to Sanctuary who have temporarily left it. A few words about balance The Druid can fight with magic but can also turn into a bear or a werewolf We would like to clarify that our final evaluation of Diablo 4 does not take into account the balance or, better to say, the lack thereof. Balancing titles like Diablo 4 is very difficult, an almost titanic undertaking that requires frequent and multiple updates: not surprisingly, already a few days after the launch Blizzard has taken steps to publish a round of improvements and reductions that have overturned the effectiveness of some classes . In a sense, this temporary imbalance is part of the game: the existence of classes that have more or less advantages over the others leads players to create new characters and try out different configurations, constantly fueling player turnover and growing interest in content that leans into the refinements of the gameplay. Currently, Diablo 4 is perfectly playable with every class. We certainly would have preferred a better balance between the possible builds of each class, but it doesn't seem that there are classes that are more dysfunctional than others, at least not at the medium / low levels of the final contents. It is clear that if there had been an imbalance such as to make the title unplayable with this or that class we would have been more severe: it is also for this reason that we have chosen to play with the Druid, one of the most criticized classes in the beta weekends - although it wasimpossible to unlock even his Spirits of nature - but with which we had no problem completing the campaign and diving into the endgame, alone and in company. World Bosses are timed events The balancing issue affects, if anything, the skill reset issue. We raised the issue in our initial review, predicting it would have a bigger impact in the endgame. In this case there are two considerations to make. Firstly, the money required to completely reset skills was not as exorbitant as it seemed: at the end of the game you accumulate a lot of gold and the reset does not empty your wallet so much, also because this feature was not meant to be used continuously. Secondly, Blizzard wants players to invest their time on the most important and significant builds, but any updates that weaken some skills - and therefore some builds - can force players to reset one or more skills, in an attempt to find a satisfactory new configuration. Not being able to predict the frequency and impact of these updates, it is difficult to consider the inevitable problem of balance as something that could detract from the experience, also because we have not felt the weight of these imbalances. For the moment, in short, it makes little sense to express a definitive judgment on the matter, but it certainly cannot be said that they have not moved rapidly in Irvine. The endgame: what it is and how it works The Diablo 4 Excellence screen After the campaign, the player can continue to explore Sanctuary and pursue the activities present from the beginning: side quests, expeditions and cellars, public events, the search for Lilith's effigies and so on. By completing the first main expedition, however, another difficulty level of the world is unlocked - which strengthens enemies but also improves loot - and opens up a range of activities that allows you to continue growing your character especially after level 50, when the board of Excellences becomes available: in this screen you can better define the builds, choosing various bonuses and Glyphs that give new characteristics and variables to skill combinations. Glyphs are enhanced by successfully completing Nightmare Expeditions: the latter take place in Expeditions that we already know, but which after using the appropriate Nightmare Seal become more difficult with the addition of various modifiers. Nightmare unlock increasingly difficult or complex Expeditions, hurling hordes of enemies at the player, especially of elite rank, who can drop loot more frequently. The purpose of the endgame, after all, is only that: to enhance one's character by resorting to ever better loots. The large variety of parameters randomly associated with loot prompts a constant search for the best items or the highest percentages, and the new features of Diablo 4, which include the ability to mine and imprint legendary powers on common items from the beginning, they offer the player enormous freedom of choice. In the endgame, the Sanctuary map fills up with objectives Other content designed only for the endgame is added to the Nightmare Expeditions. Once the Whispering Tree is unlocked, the Sanctuary map fills up with objectives that reward Grim Boons, and for every ten boons you accumulate, you can choose a chest full of random loot. Fields of Hate and Tides of Hell are timed events where enemies drop currencies that open special chests, but Fields of Hate are the only areas in Sanctuary where players they can steal each other's collected currency, while Infernal Tides appear randomly in different places on the map and make us fight hordes of enemies. Finally, the world bosses appear in specific areas of the Sanctuary at intervals of time and are the most difficult contents, since more players are needed to defeat them, but potentially also the most profitable. In short, the variety of contents is not lacking, and once a certain level and passed the second main Expedition, a further level of the world is unlocked in which the best loots are found. The progressive unveiling of content and difficulty levels helps to hold the player's interest, who feels stimulated to repeat the aforementioned activities in search of equipment improvements, while at the same time accumulating experience points to unlock new excellences in the board : they are not particularly innovative and original solutions, but they work and engage theplayer without boring him. Pros and cons of the endgame We advise you to complete the campaign to unlock the mount Basically, Diablo 4's endgame offers a plethora of objectives in which experience points or loot is gained in one way or another, and once you reach the maximum level, all you have to do is keep looking for the perfect equipment or grow a new character. The Dark Favors system guarantees a good variety of situations, scenarios and challenges in each game, but it is clear that the most experienced players will look for records to beat alone or with friends in Nightmare Expeditions. We greatly appreciated the content variety of the endgame, a little less the timed content, such as the world bosses and the Infernal Tides, which end up being closed to those who are unable to connect in those moments of the day. It is clear that at at a certain point a sense of repetitiveness takes over, which is natural in this genre of games, but which also depends on the player and his level of tolerance and interest in this type of title. In other words, the Diablo fan who seeks to continuously maximize his performance will find in Diablo 4 a gigantic playground in which to spend hundreds of hours: if the skill system is already satisfactory - net of an interface that, we reiterate, we find it awkward and not very intuitive in the assignment and restoration of nodes - that of the Excellencies further stratifies the experience, granting even more control tools. Nightmare Seals change Expeditions to Nightmare Expeditions Diablo 4's endgame is much more articulated than that of Diablo III, but also less straight, and in this sense the open world structure of this iteration of Sanctuary ended up being a bit tight. In Diablo III it was possible to launch the game, open a passage and complete it in just a few minutes: this type of approach also and above all favored players who had little time available and who could frame a quick match between one commitment and another . In Diablo 4, the vastness of the game world and the complexity of the endgame dynamics deprive the experience of its immediacy. To reach a Nightmare Expedition, say, you must first look for the right Seal in your inventory, then find the entrance on the map, teleport to the nearest Crossroads - provided that it is unlocked - and then leave on foot or at a gallop in the direction of the shipment. The same goes for any other content: the size of the game world, however varied and scenically cared for, works against the immediacy of the gameplay. Diablo 4 is a title that needs to be given time and consideration: from navigating the world to choosing the endgame content to deal with, passing through the assignment of skill points or excellences. Each choice has an important weight and must be considered with a minimum of foresight, in order to avoid gross errors and useless waste of time and gold. The Whispering Tree will reward us for every 10 Grim Favors This kind of approach, however, modernizes Diablo 4 significantly, especially in light of its new live service nature. The Blizzard title is made to last, and a lot, but also to be nibbled and resumed at different times, for example at the exit of the seasons or expansions. Already in this embryonic state, however, Diablo 4 offers an impressive quantity and variety of contents and solutions, and none of them refers to the notorious microtransactions: despite the disheartening prices, the shop only sells questionable cosmetic contents that we believe have an almost non-existent appeal .It remains to be seen how Blizzard will beef up the game in the months to come. The seasons should offer challenges and additional content that will put players to the test, while guaranteeing a plurality of rewards for those who have the strength to start or restart the adventure with the Battle Pass on duty. For the moment, we can only promote the latest Blizzard effort, which everyone feared was the result of hasty development, the most vulgar marketing and Activision's cold and calculating gaze. Instead, in Diablo 4 we have found the most genuine and passionate spirit of a developer who has signed masterpieces after masterpieces: if the guys from Irvine manage to maintain this momentum we will find out over time.", "date": "2023-06-15", "grade": "8.5"}
