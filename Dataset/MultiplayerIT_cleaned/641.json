{"name": "50 Cent: Bulletproof", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/50-cent-bulletproof.html", "text": "AK, Uzi and sympathy 50 Cent: Bulletproof has the undoubted advantage of being an extremely immediate product in its way of addressing itself to the user: in the role of the G-Unit frontman you have the simple task of consummating your revenge against those who shot you in the back, obviously going through a whole series of levels of urban carnage. So far nothing wrong, certainly from a guy like 50 Cent one could not expect a flight simulator or an RPG. Bulletproof is a structurally quite conventional and linear third-person shooter: you run, you shoot, every now and then you press a few buttons. In short, the classic routine that finds timid cues in the presence of the 50 Cent crew to surround the shooting action: Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo actively participate alongside the player, providing firepower and shrewd comments without sparing some peculiar ability to be exploited to solve ~puzzles~ actually limited to pressing a context sensitive key. Between one barrage of Uzis, 50 Cent can find time to indulge in a whole other set of constructive activities as well, such as killing enemies with brutal close-quarters moves (obviously visualized in slow-mo and with extensive bloodshed ), take them from behind and subject them to bloody interrogations (which are completely useless), use walls and obstacles as cover, collect various types of bonuses and finally rob the corpses of their belongings. The element of money plays a fundamental role in the sections between one level and another, in which it is possible to buy weapons, healing pills and new moves from a real ~gangsta~. Content is certainly not missing in 50 Cent: Bulletproof, seen and considered how the game offers a whole series of videos and unlockable bonuses, as well as a huge number of original tracks by the rapper himself or his G-Unit. However, since it is a video game, the first place on the scale of values should be occupied by the gameplay, and not by the number of extras offered by the play package... One shot, no kills The lack of care that pervades the entire game structure of 50 Cent: Bulletproof is something really embarrassing. The control system is the one that first amazes, obviously in negative terms: lacking any lock-on system, the Vivendi Universal title relies on the right stick for aiming, which needless to say is so inaccurate as to prevent hitting a enemy one meter away. And that's not an exaggeration. A defect accompanied and magnified in its gravity by other real videogame blasphemies, starting from a level design at the historical maximum of flatness, also sunk by an unjustified and very annoying automatic respawn of the enemies. From anthology then the total lack of accuracy of the context sensitive commands: it is not at all uncommon to have to press the same key two or three times before 50 Cent understands that he is opening a door or taking cover behind an object, and in the latter case  inexplicably - it often happens that you are still vulnerable to enemy fire. Again, the three companions of G-Unit are absolutely invulnerable and deadly accurate in shooting enemies, an element which, combined with the chronic imprecision of their scope and the elementary structure of all levels, opens up a picturesque game opportunity: run from a bonus to the other, trying to stay alive, to get to the end of the stage and leave the CPU-led soldiers to clean up the opponents. In short, not the best in terms of satisfaction. As is evident, 50 Cent: Bulletproof is such a lacunary product from a playful point of view that it touches the unenviable reputation of an unplayable video game: and even the most ardent fans of the rapper and his gang will hardly be able to turn a blind eye (if not all and two) in the face of massive problems plaguing Vivendi Universal stock. Not even an all in all decent technical sector manages to rescue 50 Cent: Bulletproof from a resounding rejection: on the other hand a graphic that gives its best during the cutscenes and a musical accompaniment that is all too zealous in wanting to propose as many tracks as possible from the repertoire of 50 Cent certainly cannot be a reason for enthusiasm... Comment Needless to get around it: 50 Cent: Bulletproof is a promotional product disguised as a video game. Otherwise, the alacrity on the part of the developers to fill the title with unlockable videos and music tracks and to take care of only the visual aspect, sensationally flying over everything else, cannot be explained. Equipped with a very limited game structure and overwhelmed by a high series of macroscopic technical flaws, 50 Cent: Bulletproof does nothing but revealrsi terribly clumsy in trying to attract attention to himself thanks to the load of gratuitous violence and the notoriety of the protagonist. unplayable Cross-platform The PS2 and Xbox versions are very similar, even from a technical point of view. The end result is unfortunately the same, for a title that will certainly not be remembered in the annals. Branded by many as a mere commercial operation right from the first announcements of its development, 50 Cent: Bulletproof is finally out in stores, following some decisive postponements and picturesque declarations by the rapper himself about a catchment area of his product that also extends to younger. An at least unhappy release by 50 Cent, considering how his Bulletproof not only does not represent the maximum morality applied to video games, but above all it is definitely not the best way to bring a kid closer to the world of electronic entertainment...", "date": "2006-01-23", "grade": null}
