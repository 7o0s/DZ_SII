It cannot be said that that edition was a success, and not only on Wii, but in general it was considered almost like a spin-off, of little importance compared to the main saga, the one that inserts numbers, not dates, next to the name. In 2011, therefore, here is the canonical successor of the third chapter, Virtua Tennis 4: its task, in a nutshell, is to revive the saga from a slow and constant decline. Grand Spin Tennis 4 On other platforms (we're referring to PS3 and Xbox360) the great rival of the SEGA game was Top Spin 4, also recently released: if in the past the result of the clash between these two sagas was determined by subjective preferences - lovers of the arcade preferred Virtua Tennis, those of the Top Spin simulation - on this occasion, while personal taste remained sacred, the challenge was won 6-0 6-0 by the western production, which surpassed the Japanese one from any point of view . On Wii... well, on Wii the question is very different: without further emphasizing the tragicomic situation of third parties (a console with an installed base of 85 million snubbed by software houses is a more unique than rare case, but anyway ) we limit ourselves to stating that the Wii version of Top Spin 4 is truncated compared to the main one, a semi-disaster, a game of a disarming approximation when compared to the painstaking production of its older brother. Here, having clarified this, it should also be specified that the Wii in terms of tennis games is not doing badly at all: in addition to the authentic heir of pong (the tennis of Wii Sports) it hosts, exclusively, the excellent and little considered Grand Slam Tennis, born in 2009, developed by EA, the only exponent of the genre to be built around the (pseudo) 1:1 controls allowed by MotionPlus. In short, if on Xbox360 and PlayStation 3 the great rival is called Top Spin 4, on Wii the two opponents are Wii Sports and Grand Slam Tennis. Wii Static Plus All this premise to understand the context in which you have to immerse yourself in order to create a good tennis game on Wii: it cannot be said that Virtua Tennis 2009 was an epochal title, but it cannot be accused of not ~trying~. The motion controls in that episode were less precise and in-depth than those in Grand Slam Tennis, but they were still a start, a first step into uncharted territory. If on the so-called next-gen consoles the essential thing is to exploit the greatest ~power~ to improve the play mechanics (physics, interaction, etc... all things that Top Spin has refined admirably), on Wii, to ensure that it is not only a minor version compared to the others, you have to make the most of the motion controls. Well, that's not the case with Virtua Tennis 4. The Wii edition is a simple reduction of the PS3 one and, like the PS3 one, relegates the use of MotionPlus (or Move) to a secondary mode, so very secondary which does not support multiplayer or tournaments or online, nor multiple shots: it is a matter of playing in first person, in single performances, and you have to be satisfied with being able to alter the difficulty of the CPU. What's most annoying - and trust me, it's hugely annoying, given the uncertain future of motion control - is that this mode, while overlooked and blatantly subordinated, works really well. The Plus recognizes the intensity and direction of the shot, you can attack with top or backspin in a completely realistic way, above all you can combine such various information relating to depth, intensity and rotation of the ball that everything appears absolutely out of reach for the capabilities of a regular pad. And knowing that you can't do all this playing in third person, that you can't do it by moving the character with the control stick (the tennis player follows the ball automatically, you can send it to the net but it's a cumbersome process to say the least) is unnerving. and demeaning. The motion controls are also supported in a multiplayer perspective, but only in one mode, and the denomination of the same (~party~) makes it clear how seriously it has been built: little serious and badly calibrated mini-games, an absolutely accessory part with respect to the essence of Virtual Tennis 4. Virtua Tennis 4- So what's left? As anticipated before, a truncated version of the original one, which is played only with the Wiimote placed horizontally, with the B button for lobs and A for the ~special shot~, both difficult buttons to reach during the most agitated matches. Speaking of the special shot, it is the only real novelty introduced in this fourth episode: unfortunately it only affects the exchanges superficially, it is a move (usable only after havinga bar) more scenic than effective, and also its potential, interesting consequences (since the bar is filled using the strengths of the various characters you should play on the opponent's weaknesses to prevent him from accumulating ~energy~) are rendered in fact non-existent due to the substantial uselessness/rarity of the super-hit. An evident improvement compared to the old episodes is the almost total elimination of diving recoveries, which in Virtua Tennis 2009 had taken on a farcical connotation. Always excellent and credible - as usual the spearhead of the series - the relationship between shooting speed and timing/position of the shot. In short, what we find in our hands is a refined and a little more realistic version of the first Virtua Tennis, released more than ten years ago. So it matters little if the World Tour mode is well done and thorough, if the tennis players are well differentiated and the bounce of the ball varies realistically based on the surface: the core of the game, the core of the gameplay is now old, and it's time for a change .", "date": "2011-05-06", "grade": "6.0"}
