The release of the multi-platform videogame which stands as a ~spin-off~ of the film, rather than as a real transposition (due to the need not to reveal the plot yet), constitutes a clear turning point in this picture. Unfortunately, however, things did not go as expected and the work done by Ubisoft proved to be much less brilliant than usual. On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the game is characterized by the use of unprecedented 3D techniques, albeit reserved for the small circle of people who own a certain type of television. And on Wii? Not being able to implement the same technology, the team assigned to develop the title for the Nintendo console has seen fit to introduce the optional support for both the Motion Plus and the Balance Board. It is, on balance, a feature that adds very little to the experience: the Motion Plus does not in any way improve the detection of movements during the standard game action, but allows us to directly control an extra weapon (in this case a Pandorian ~wasp~) capable of stunning enemies. Even less useful is the Balance Board, the pressure of which should in theory make the use of the Banshee (a flying creature) more intuitive, but which in reality only makes control during the aerial phases more complicated. Hide and attack The protagonist of James Cameron's Avatar: The Game is a Na'vi warrior who wants to prevent the human invaders from taking possession of Pandorian weapons. Three meters tall and with blue skin, it is clear that such a character could not find a better approach than stealth to eliminate his opponents. Right? However, the scenario is full of areas to climb and expanses of tall grass that can help us in the arduous task of hiding from the enemy's gaze, at least until he is close enough to attack him. At that point, just press the B trigger on the Wii-mote and execute the movement shown on the screen (usually a downward slash) to knock out the guard and pass to his companions. The behavioral routines of our adversaries are discreet and plausible: they do not notice our presence if we are hidden even a few meters away, but once they have identified us they do not let go or forget us until the clash is resolved with ours or with their victory. Fighting head on isn't easy, especially when the enemies are many and well armed, but the system that regulates attacks proves to be quite precise and fun: shaking the Wii-mote horizontally or vertically translates into a corresponding attack using the Na'vi service staff. There is a combo system that allows us to tie several shots together, but it is based on timing rather than movements and therefore is often difficult to use. Given the frenzy of the clashes, you generally end up shaking the controller in bulk, still obtaining the desired result. In the blue painted blue The stick is not the only weapon at our disposal, however: we can also use a bow whose arrows go perfectly with the classic ~explosive barrels~, defeating even numerous teams of humans in an instant. To use the bow, hold down the B trigger and move the crosshair on the screen until it turns red, then press the A button to shoot the arrow. The gameplay is therefore divided between stealth phases, open combat, archery sessions and stages in which you fly astride a Banshee. Unfortunately, the exploration of the scenario is reduced to a minimum: the game tells us when to jump and when to climb, leaving us very little freedom of choice. The interactable areas, however, are very few and make our path practically predetermined. The limited control of the view closes the circle of a truly limited freedom of movement: our actions bend to the needs of the ~plot~ although the latter is in fact inconsistent. The possibility of playing in two in a cooperative mode (with the second player who can join the game at any time) only ends up accentuating the limits of the Ubisoft product, whose gameplay is already ~strict~ for a single person. And the technical realization doesn't help: the graphics appear quite defined, with scenarios full of details which, however, take little time to become repetitive and whose interactivity leaves much to be desired. Furthermore, despite the limited management of the view, the engine cannot keep up with the movements of the character and is produced in frequential drops in frame rate. The sound is essential, with music and effects of little impact to which is added a very little ~convinced~ dubbing in Italian.", "date": "2009-12-07", "grade": "5.0"}
