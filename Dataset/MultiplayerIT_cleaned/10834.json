The tie-in of Watchmen, a film released in theaters on March 6, puts us in the shoes of two of the heroes created by the pen of His Majesty Alan Moore, Night Owl II and Rorschach, setting the game not during the events told in the film, but ten years earlier, in the turbulent 70s. Scrolling fighting game in its most classic and uncompromising sense, the Deadline Games game takes us back at least fifteen years, and graphics aside, it seems to have learned little or nothing from what has passed on our screens in the last five decades. Dynamic duo Everything is too schematic and repetitive, you enter a room, beat everyone up and move on to the next. Point. Not that given the starting material, a complex title was necessarily required, but here it is really at a minimum, there is very little to do and what little is done is boring, and partly badly implemented. The two heroes, each with its own fighting style and a good number of combos, have to fight waves of enemies that are all the same and have little artificial intelligence, in practice in crowded situations we will rarely see the enemies hurl themselves all together, on the contrary they will diligently wait for the own turn to lead the way. Not everything is to be thrown away however. In the same way as the film, the programmers have pushed enough on the side of ultra-violence, and it is certainly pleasant to see Rorschach perform, through the classic quick time events, final moves that reward the player with the pleasant sound of broken bones. In addition to the combos, which are nothing more than a ~noble~ way to call pushing the keys at random by varying between square and triangle, it is also possible to perform projections, counterattacks which, if done with the right timing, break the opponent's guard and bring directly to the aforementioned final moves, and special attacks that take advantage of the rage bar that loads every time we knock out an enemy. The impression is that, although the mechanics work more than discreetly, especially the countermoves against the larger and slower enemies, everything is tremendously confusing, and given that the clashes can also contemplate a high number of enemies on the screen (provided that these attack), you find yourself doing pure and healthy ~button mashing~ and only rarely is it possible to create that combo and those special attacks that should be the fulcrum of the game. Playing the game alone for about two/three hours these problems come to the surface almost immediately, in pairs instead (through a vertical split screen) it is possible to ennoble the work done by the programmers by adopting a slightly more technical conduct in the clashes, but in the long run the same critical issues that haunt the single mode also emerge in pairs. To be an ~old-fashioned~ scrolling fighting game, very little has been done to go beyond a tired repetition of old game mechanics, it is not enough to insert combos and quick time events if then the whole game is reduced to pushing the keys for two hours at random, with little pathos and with zero interest in moving forward. To all these problems we must add the price of the title, around fifteen euros for a maximum of three hours of play, an unattractive value for money, in short, in the light of the fact that, in addition to the structural problems, for the same amount there are Longer and fuller titles have just come out. New York City Lights Instead, it is in the cosmetics that the game has its strong point. Night Owl II and Rorschach are really well done, with great textures and beautiful animations that perfectly capture the violence of the clashes seen in the film. The enemies, although not surprising for the variety of models, and not made with the same care placed in the two Watchmen, are discreetly made, they play the part of designated targets without infamy or praise. On the other hand, the settings are excellent, with good light effects and some spot-on shaders, such as the one used for the water, while the artistic direction in recreating the nocturnal atmosphere, dirty and torn by neon lights, is absolutely excellent in some situations. weight taken from that of the film. Honorable mention for the interlude films, a sort of animated comic, which takes advantage of the original voices of the American actors, capable of telling the events in a sober way, in the manner of the graphic novel, completely departing from the look of the film between chapters. Comment Watchmen: The End is Nigh does not betray the golden rule of tie-ins, which is the one that imposes games that are only sufficient, without particular flashes, to be combined with successful films. Graphic at parte, the game is partly deficient: a theoretically good combat system is counterbalanced by an absolute poverty of content, with about three hours of gameplay always equal to themselves, in which in the midst of the most total chaos one does nothing but push , almost always at random, the attack keys. Definitely more pleasant played in pairs than in singles, it justifies the fifteen euros spent on the purchase. In short, a title which, although consistent with the spirit of the old scrolling fighting games, does little or nothing to revive a genre that has now disappeared, but rather flattens out on itself by canceling the added value given by the cinematographic license.Pro Graphically well done Beating up as Rorsharch is priceless Great cutscenes Against Too short Contents poor and repetitive Artificial intelligence to review PlayStation 3 - Trophies The game offers twelve trophies, seven bronze, four silver and one gold. Rather easy to obtain, they are for the most part all linked to the number of attacks performed, finishing moves or projections, while the more demanding ones see us engaged in completing the game within eighty minutes or finishing a level without continuing, but above all without being hit.", "date": "2009-03-09", "grade": null}
