It was 2009, now a decade ago, when a particularly interesting title appeared on the market, but initially recognized as too difficult and distinctly far from the canons of the modern video game. That game was called Demon's Souls and still bears the extraordinary honor (and burden) of being the progenitor of the most important and significant sub-genre of the last ten years. All born from a simple but extraordinary idea: to take the classic action RPG and build a punishing but grandly satisfying title around it, capable of conveying to the player a sense of progression that is difficult to find elsewhere. The baby of master Miyazaki and From Software represented only the beginning of a long journey: today, ten years later and after dozens of titles and variations on the genre, the A44 team arrives on the market with the awaited Ashen, title purchasable exclusively on Xbox One and (currently) on PC on the newborn Epic Games store. To the delight of all owners of the Microsoft console, the game can be enjoyed free of charge for Game Pass subscribers, representing another mouthful after Mutant Year Zero. We have tested it thoroughly and we have made our own idea: between lights and shadows, Ashen manages to make some stylistic features of the genre its own, excelling in almost nothing, but still trying to innovate some game mechanics. The result is a general simplification of the soulslike setting, which could have the great merit of bringing some players who have always been averse to From Software's works closer to the genre. The story of the Ashen quest It is useless to hide that already from the introduction Ashen declares his love for Miyazaki's titles, one above all Dark Souls. The presentation of the world that welcomes us and of the mythological figures that represent its divinities recall Lordran and his Lords. Furthermore, as if that were not enough, even the name and the scenes dedicated to the lord of men are so reminiscent of dear old Gwin as to generate a certain sense of plagiarism. Closed the parenthesis, what is important to keep in mind is that the world has suffered a great loss, that of the Ashen precisely, which has thrown it into darkness awaiting the rebirth of this saving figure. We and our alter ego enter the game on the day of the return of the Ashen, charged by the mighty Bataran to look after its growth, because it is still too young and defenseless to survive the pitfalls of darkness. From this moment our (discreetly) long journey through the lands surrounding the Asylum del Ramingo will start. During the twenty hours needed to complete most of the activities present, Ashen will tell us the story mainly through the words of the various non-player characters we will meet, real co-protagonists of the story, able to increase our knowledge and also the abilities of our alter ego. Far be it from us to want to anticipate events, but what we need to keep in mind is that the sense of belonging never really manages to make us identify with the world built by the guys at A44, contrary to what happened, for example, with the Unkindled in the last chapter of the From Software trilogy. The result is that at the end of your journey, you will hardly remember some of the moments experienced with great emotion, despite a good characterization and a rather inspired design. More action than RPG gameplay Ashen is an atypical soulslike and we said this from the beginning. Nonetheless, if it is true that appearances can be deceiving, the New Zealand game is also an atypical RPG. Where the basis of the genre has always responded to the need to manage the growth of one's alter ego through the accumulation of experience to then be spent to increase one's characteristics, Ashen brings into play a rather important simplification: there are no characteristics or the possibility to increase them to your liking: growth passes through the resolution of the various quests of the game. We mentioned before the Asylum of the Ranger: this place works as a central hub, and after an initial research necessary to make the ritual stones usable again (very similar to the bonfires of Dark Souls) the Asylum will become the new home of all the various NPCs that we will meet on our journey. Whether it's an old warrior, the woman of the great Bataran or our first adventure companion, the change of the small settlement will represent one of the best aspects of the experience. These changes will not only affect dialogues and unlockable features but, also on an aesthetic level, the village will growto become a real point of reference for the new world. Once you have had a chat with the characters settled in the village, a related enterprise (main or secondary) will be activated, which will be fully visible and traceable on the other great novelty and simplification for a soulslike: the game map. The whole world of Ashen is in fact interconnected, and in addition to the possibility of moving on foot between the various areas, it will also be possible (from a certain moment on) to quickly pass from one stone to another, making exploration and reaching certain environments child's play. More or less. Because in crossing clearings, mountains, deserts and ruins, you will come across a plethora of enemies of the most diverse shapes. Although the title does not boast an extraordinary artificial intelligence, the ability of the enemy to overwhelm the player, especially when outnumbered, is absolutely believable. This net of feedback from the weapons and an adrenaline rush of the action which, unfortunately, never really take off, crashing disastrously against the very weak (from a design point of view) bosses that the A44 game has to offer. As for the equipment, Ashen allows you to take up two weapons (one light and one heavy), a shield or a lantern to shed light in the dungeons still prey to darkness, a couple of consumables with the most diverse uses and flasks crimson, equal in characteristics and use to the more famous estus. As for health and stamina, as already mentioned, the game allows you to increase them by progressing in the missions, giving us specific upgrades at certain times. It is also possible to collect from the ground, in some specific points, feathers dropped by the Ashen itself, useful for giving a small increase in value to our characteristics. As in all soulslikes, the souls recovered by killing enemies or obtained from the collected consumables (to be honest here called ~slag~), can be spent to buy new upgrades, spells, further flasks and improve their effectiveness but not to modify the statistics. This choice, if on the one hand it drastically reduces the role-playing component and, consequently, the replayability factor, on the other we found it particularly appreciable from the point of view of immediacy. It is precisely on this that Ashen wins his bet against all odds. Simplicity could certainly be a new way, closer to the general public, to present this extraordinary genre. Cooperation, the important one Ashen is equipped with a convenient online cooperation system. The whole game is permeated with areas and small situations that can only be solved in pairs (an element that can be bypassed using a specific amulet). This drive towards cooperation is immediately clear, and its management is as ingenious as it is cumbersome. Unlike From Software's titles, you won't need to leave your world to enter another player's world, just as you won't disappear when a boss is defeated. Joining means finding another player in your game who will impersonate the specific character who would otherwise have joined you in that mission. This choice, although understandable from a narrative point of view, destroys any desire for aesthetic customization that is not linked to your adventure. You can decide to play online, offline or completely eliminate the presence of artificial intelligence. It goes without saying that, just like the enemies, the companions will not prove to be geniuses either, but despite this, their strength will sometimes be so devastating as to clean up the areas even before you can take action. The advice is to activate the filter and enter a password, if you want to make it easier and more immediate to meet up with your friend. Technically dull Ashen uses the now much abused low poly technique, to field a decidedly uninspired artistic design. Over the course of the hours played, we will have happened to be amazed such a small number of times that we cannot even take them into consideration. The writer does not hide his aversion for this specific graphic style, by now abused and not very expressive (Journey and Abz represent the exception that proves the rule) but regardless of this the models are mediocre, the animations not very inspired and the places will hardly be in able to make you jump on your seat with emotion. The same goes for the audio sector: none of the accompaniments ever really has the incisiveness suitable for marking a clash or the discovery of a new area, limiting itself to acting as a side dish. Despite this, it cannot be deniedthe ability of New Zealand kids to create a coherent world. Considering the amount of elements and the small budget, we still believe that applause is due for a team that accepted a demanding challenge and did not disappoint.", "date": "2018-12-15", "grade": "7.5"}
