Horizons of glory However, the predominant element is the tactical one with moments that closely resemble the masterpiece Eidos. The fundamental innovations of Soldiers are in the massive inclusion of vehicles (which can also be driven directly with the keyboard) and in the presence of real battles in the open field. Obviously in these situations you find yourself in command of much more than a handful of men: you will come to command small armies engaged in frontal clashes with the enemy on duty. Don't misunderstand what I wrote: massing your troops and attacking head-on doesn't pay off in any situation and you'll soon end up annihilated. Planning your moves carefully remains essential even in the most hectic moments and is also the only way to be able to pass the advanced levels. But we need to take a decisive step back. Starting the game you can choose to face one of four different campaigns (each faction has its own). In each campaign we will lead different troops that have the specific weapons of our army (but during the levels we will also be able to collect the weapons of dead enemies). Another fundamental difference with Commandos appears evident from the first mission: the game maps are often very large so as to allow the coexistence of a good number of armies; there will be smaller maps in which a limited number of men are usually guided and it must be possible to prevent our presence from being discovered. The Dirty Dozen The details of the settings are excellent From a technical point of view Soldiers proved to be really well done. Not only is it fluid even on medium - low configurations but it is also very nice to look at: the textures are excellent as are the different models of buildings and vehicles. The soldiers are well drawn even if they lack some animation frames resulting in rather woody movements. In terms of special effects Soldiers does not miss anything: explosions, mists, dynamic lights, etc. in the most excited moments of the battles it seems to be in front of a real Hollywood war film. Too bad for some confusion which I will talk about later. In short, the detail of 3D is not yet at the same level of an excellent 2D but it is fearfully approaching it. From the sound point of view we are on the same levels as the graphics: good music and excellent sound effects season the action in a pleasant way. Perhaps (and unfortunately) the soldiers' voices translated into Italian are not very pleasant to hear and the original languages would not have hurt. If this is a man But let's get to the actual game and delve into some of the hints made above. In the first place, we notice most of the advantages and some defects of the control system right from the start. On the one hand there is a certain cumbersomeness in learning some functions which is not to be considered a negative thing a priori, also because, once the various commands have been internalized, they are instead suitable for the various actions that can be performed. On the other hand, some inaccuracies in the response of our soldiers are immediately evident. Let's give an example: to overcome a fence, just click on it so that the selected troops will go there by jumping to the other side. Or at least they should. Sometimes, however, they will tend to get to the side of the obstacle and will stand still as if they had overcome it. It doesn't happen very often, but during a battle it can be truly fatal since the opponents do not show great mercy for a broken enemy. Another problem is artificial intelligence. Men, left alone, will almost always tend to act quite intelligent. The ~almost~ of the previous sentence indicates instead those moments in which intelligence abandons them without warning, leaving them at the mercy of a rather marked idiocy. But let's take the usual example. I posted one man behind a wall and another behind a tree trunk. I decide to use a third man directly behind a car. We are in the center of a village and some Nazis are on patrol. I pop out of cover and fire as soon as they're in range. My comrades support me by shooting with a certain precision. So far, so good. Unfortunately, the smart guy behind the tree decides to take his very personal initiative: he mysteriously leaves the cover and lies down in the middle of the road and starts shooting at the Nazis. Obviously a target in the open is not a difficult target to hit. Without having time to intervene eHere my ex-soldier is riddled with bullets and falls lifeless to the ground. Other AI problems are evident in big battles where sometimes you will always lose troops for their questionable initiatives. To honor the work done by the Best Way guys, the excellent balance of the missions that are affordable at an easy level while they are decidedly challenging at the maximum level of difficulty should certainly be mentioned. This will also allow those who found the Commandos series too difficult to tame into the game. [C] One of the briefings present at the beginning of each mission The opposing troops, even if they are much larger; many of ours, will be short-lived We almost made it through unscathed [/C] They haven't seen us yet. Soon it will be; hell. One of the most interesting features offered by Soldiers is the possibility to directly drive the vehicles. Well, we can say that, for once, promises have been kept. Just hold down the [CTRL] key to take control of the vehicle on which we have positioned our men. This turns out to be quite fun during mass battles in which direct combat skills will be an extra weapon to win battles. Those who fear the risk that the action becomes too ~arcade~ can rest assured: it is never possible to take a tank and slaughter all the enemies (except, perhaps, at the lowest game difficulty level). If you don't maintain a minimum of tacticity in your movements you will still be swept away in no time. And then in the game you find yourself doing so many different actions that shooting at some helpless enemy (this is frustrated gamer sadism) turns out to be a pleasant diversion. Perhaps the real risk is that some confusion is generated in battles that see more troops on the field. Also in this case unfortunately it must be said that artificial intelligence certainly does not help the player in the task of keeping everything under control. Comment Soldiers: Heroes of World War II is an excellent game that lacks a lot in some refinements. If some inaccuracies had been filed and if the artificial intelligence had been implemented better now we can talk about a masterpiece. Maybe some problems can be fixed with one or more patches. However, the defects do not compromise the gaming experience and, with some tricks, it is possible to limit them in order to make them secondary and almost no longer consider them as one proceeds with the levels and gains experience. Sure, finding a soldier armed with a pistol shooting openly on his own initiative against a mortar makes you laugh a bit but it also makes you sad. In short, a good alternative to Commandos and similar, technically excellent, which deserves to be considered above all for some of the innovations it brings with it. Pros: Technically excellent Commandos with a broader scope Balanced gameplay Cons Upgradable artificial intelligence Confusing in the most heated battles Horizons of glory The Second World War is undoubtedly in fashion. A couple of titles come out every month with the historical facts of the greatest and most dramatic conflict ever fought by humanity as a background. Freud would probably be interested in the ~greatest~ and would study the phenomenon starting from there. We gamers can limit ourselves to the dramatic side, both while playing and while talking about the game. Maybe the people who don't need heroes don't exist. It is above all during wars that the production of indigenous myths increases dramatically, as is happening these days, after all. The risk of inflation is remote and will likely affect future generations. Soldiers: Heroes of World War II assumes (already present in the title) that each of the warring factions in World War II had its own heroes to celebrate. So let's get ready to lead British, American, Russian and German troops in missions that resemble part Commandos and part normal real-time strategy.", "date": "2004-06-28", "grade": null}
