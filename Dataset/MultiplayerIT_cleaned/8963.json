It was 2001, in fact, when Tintin: Destination Adventure was released for PlayStation and PC, proposing platform dynamics and adventure elements similar to those we find today in the tie-in of the animated film directed by Steven Spielberg and produced, among others, by Peter Jackson. Entrusted to the expert hands of Ubisoft Montpellier, the team responsible for projects such as Beyond Good & Evil, Rayman Origins and From Dust, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn follows the plot of the feature film quite faithfully, adapting the situations and scenarios seen in the cinema in order to put them at the service of the gameplay. The story that is told to us, mostly through cutscenes, shows the first meeting between the young reporter and Captain Haddock, both involved in the search for a treasure hidden by an ancestor of the latter. The adventure will lead the two to become great friends and to face pitfalls of all kinds together, given that the treasure is tempting even to a group of unscrupulous criminals. The game itself is basically a platformer in which we take on the role of Tintin, with the aim of reaching the exit within each stage, sometimes solving simple puzzles and knocking out all the thugs we find on our way. The control system designed for the occasion is immediately immediate and precise. In the Wii version, for example, the Nunchuk analog stick moves the character, the A button of the Wii-mote is used to jump and interact with the setting, the B trigger to pick up objects to throw or grab enemies, and finally the shaking of the controller to hit the opponent with a powerful one-two punch. At first, the necessary adherence to the events of the film gives the impression of guiding Ubisoft production towards the sad fate of some poor quality tie-ins, which mix genres without art or part for the sole purpose of remaining clinging to the plot. Fortunately it is a momentary sensation, which disappears as soon as the levels begin to acquire their own consistency and to propose variations on the theme of undoubted interest. Variations on the theme Although the main nature of The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is similar to the platform genre, the aforementioned need to represent most of the sequences present in the film on the screen has led the developers to insert a series of alternative sections. The first debuts moments after the start of the adventure, and sees Tintin and Captain Haddock aboard an airplane desperately trying to survive a violent storm. Later, the same solution will be resumed with some small variations, that is, it will be possible to use the machine gun mounted on the plane to eliminate flying enemies or to open a passage between the mountains. Another alternative section puts us in command of the faithful dog Mil with a third person view and the aim of using the sense of smell to locate traces of the person we want to find. When Captain Haddock gets caught up in the stories about his ancestor, we will relive his last battles aboard the ship Unicorn through a flashback, and wielding (on the Nintendo console) the Wii-mote like a sword (complete with support for the MotionPlus) we will have to get rid of a large number of opponents, parrying their blows if necessary and taking advantage of their momentary numbness to finish them off. Then there are the sections on board the motorbike with sidecar, in which we will alternately drive the vehicle (trying to avoid the bullets and explosive barrels, while our partner takes care of hitting our pursuers) or we will use the slingshot (with the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote to manage the on-screen reticle). All of these variants can be played in the ~challenges~ mode from the main menu, across various difficulty levels, and are a really nice extra once the single player campaign has been completed. It should be noted that in the Xbox 360 version, all these sections can be played using Kinect, where all movements, recorded with excellent precision, can be performed without holding the pad. A second extra, even more substantial, is represented by the ~Tintin and Haddock~ mode, which ideally takes place at the end of the adventure, in a dreamlike dimension in which the two characters can work together (even through cooperative multiplayer for two players) and they are faced with a veritable fair of puzzles and platform-based combat. Platform mon amour Let's go back to the ~standard~ gameplay, because it is imperative to praise it and the current situation of the platform genre leads us to be even happier and more enthusiastic about the work done, with great competence, by Ubisoft Montpellier. The platform action of The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is in fact first rate, among the best seen in recent years. The mere fact of jumping from one side to another returns a great satisfaction for the precision and safety with which these dynamics have been implemented, and it is clear that as soon as the Flashback / Another World-style puzzles arrive, things can only get better further. The brevity of the first stages disappears like snow in the sun in the face of longer and more multifaceted sections, in which the character's abilities are exploited properly, dynamically, without dead spots or episodes of frustration. This last factor, unfortunately, depends above all on the fact that we wanted to address the game to a very young user target, almost completely eliminating the challenge in favor of an experience capable of flowing smoothly, without hitches, even in moments more chaotic and intricate. This does not mean, however, that the game is not very pleasant or that you find them not valid and intelligent to add more meat to the fire: the switches to be hit with an object, the banana peels on which to slide certain special enemies, the parrot which allows us to ~fly~ to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, even the small platform sequences driving Mil. In these situations we are faced with a real exercise in style, which is crowned by an excellent technical realization, especially from the point of view of the management of the lights and animations, as well as by a sound sector that is up to the situation. which alternates John Williams' music with a really well done Italian dubbing.", "date": "2011-11-08", "grade": "7.4"}
