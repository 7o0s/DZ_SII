{"name": "Universal Combat: l'infinito e oltre!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/universal-combat-linfinito-e-oltre.html", "text": "The latest product from the Derek Smart forges has seen the light and the time has come for us to analyze the new born from the Dreamcatcher house. The simulator of space simulators, as it is proposed to the market, is part of a very wide-ranging project that has engaged Smart for years in the desperate search for the perfect and absolute product. The goal, immense and probably never fully reachable, is to offer the player a realistic and equally vast simulation of space exploration trying to embrace every sphere from the explorable and therefore not stopping only at interplanetary travel or single battles between spaceships . The project should therefore provide the user with the ability to switch between the main environments continuously without interruptions of any kind, taking off, for example, from an aircraft carrier located in the middle of an ocean until reaching the stars. UC therefore merges the typical and direct experience of FPS (more suited to first-person exploration in command of a single space infantry unit deployed both on the planet and adrift in space grappling with a walk overboard), the flight, with its complicated rules for the efficient command of the vehicle and finally the strategic-managerial as regards the control of the internal resources of the fleet and crews. The challenge is to bring more action to the battlefield and to touch all possible battlefields The first peculiarity of the game is right on the packaging, or rather, it is written right in the title. In fact, for the first time since the foundation of 3000 AD (soft house led by Derek Smat) the saga abandons the usual Battlecruiser nomenclature (which however remains on a loading screen during the launch of the game) to adopt that of Universal Combat. The new title actually embodies the desire, not fully fulfilled, to make this genre dedicated to simulation a more combat-oriented game and, if possible, even more ~universal~. The challenge is to bring more action to the battlefield and to touch all possible fields of battle, without leaving out any aspect. Precisely for this reason, among the 500 different vehicles there are not only planes but also (an absolute novelty) ships and aircraft carriers (which however cannot be piloted by the player). Although the attempt is appreciable and partially supported by the results, the imprint of the game remains heavily influenced by the previous installments of the series. In fact, not only the background of the story (always not very incisive for the purposes of the saga) but also the game interfaces and the gameplay appear practically unchanged, almost as if to give continuity to the series Space hermitage The game modes offer campaign-like missions with objectives to be achieved within a certain amount of time, but it is immediately noticeable that this kind of missions do not enhance the real potential of the title, with the ~roam~ mode, however, it is possible to appreciate immediately the numerous degrees of freedom of the game. First of all, the achievement of any specific goal is not required other than to explore the length and breadth of the universe, get rich, satisfy one's goals and above all survive. It is possible to choose any professional career and start from the highest of ranks, as commander of an interstellar cruise ship as a simple soldier stationed in any military base on the most remote of the planets of the confederation. The jobs available do not only concern the strictly military sphere but range from the researcher, to the settler, to the merchant, to the pirate for more than a dozen professions. The immensity of the environment is such as to be even dispersive, just think that of the 21,000 objects scattered throughout the explorable space it is rarely possible to frame two at the same time. From cabin boy to commander, the choice is yours In command of a cruiser or a heavy battleship you can fully appreciate the vast and boundless potential of this game. At the player's service, in fact, there is an entire fleet of spaceships with crews animated by their own intentions and often difficult to govern, mechanical apparatuses (such as the engine room) to be managed with care and attention, especially in battle situations in which take damage due to the attack of enemies. The management therefore also extends to the fleet of ~satellite~ spaceships of the mother ship, such as the shuttles, which can be sent to a planet for a quick conquest or in search of precious cargoes that escaped the explosion of a cargo ship. It is possible to organize large and complex battles by directing an entire fleet of fighters that respond tothe orders of the commander, without forgetting the numerous additional weapons to manage and the possibility of releasing space mines and launching the carefully prepared missiles in the spaceship's launch ports before the assault. Unfortunately, however, the vastness of this game, which in many ways represents the real strength and characterizes its originality compared to its competitors, risks affecting its general credibility. In fact, just as happened in the previous chapter of the saga (Battle Cruiser Millennium) there is often the risk of getting lost in the ocean of possibilities available. Since there is no real purpose, the player even risks getting bored and not finding anything more to do. In fact, the ~missions~ exist for this and often the artificial intelligence of the game fails to sufficiently make up for this lack by abandoning us to the immense vastness of space. In the workshop The technical sector has numerous gaps, mostly justifiable with the size of the project. The temptation that Smart has been undergoing for years as regards the development of this saga (which we recall takes the name of Universal Combat only with this chapter, but from the beginning it was Battlecruiser, so much so that even UC had to be called Battlecruiser Generation) is to put a lot, perhaps too much meat on the fire. Graphically, the game, despite presenting numerous improvements, does not prove to be particularly brilliant, although it considerably strains the processor and the accelerator. Although the space environments appear completely credible, the charm undergoes a heavy decline by landing on the planets, which are too bare and cold. Except for the natural formations and the sparse man-made constructions, vehicles and troops on the ground, the planet too often appears bare and mangy. The textures appear flat and careless while the special effects, such as the play of light and shadow, are scarce and are really reduced to a minimum. In combat, one feels the total lack of the spectacularity of colorful and flashy explosions. The weapons do not seem to have any graphic distinction, they all shoot and explode in the same way, varying the color of the beam exiting the barrel as much as possible. A real pity, given that in general the sci-fi setting favors a more imaginative development of these resources, giving the eye a pleasant response. Nothing to complain about with regard to the construction of the models of the vehicles, orbital stations and ships, although trivial errors and bugs such as wild clipping still rage in game actions, especially when commanding the unit in the first person. A very unpleasant and often, all too often irritating aspect, because it risks invalidating an entire game for reasons unrelated to the player's conduct. No criticism, but lots of praise instead, to the sound sector created by compatriot Manuel Marino, an old acquaintance of Multiplayer.it, who has been able to create top-level tracks that give the game scenes an even more epic and enveloping aspect if possible. Sometimes, one gets the impression of floating with one's own spaceship adrift in the unknown caressed only by the half-meek and half-imperious sound of this beautiful soundtrack. Final comment Overall, the new born in the Smart house is definitely a complete, vast and high-sounding product, but very complex and not easy to appreciate for the general public. Perhaps for this very reason Dreamcatcher is working on an adaptation of the series for Xbox, which inevitably will have to focus much more on the arcade aspect, once again leaving aside the frustrating ambition of wanting to include an entire universe on a single CD. UC is recommended to all those who have not closed their eyes to the previous chapters of the Battlecruiser series and to all those who want that more that Freelancer and X2 will never be able to give: infinity. Pros: Immense and boundless Very wide range of vehicles, races and armaments Italian soundtrack, of the highest level Cons: Too ambitious, the vastness of the settings are on the verge of agoraphobia Sometimes boring Complex, both in the commands and in the rules to follow Derek, lord of space Who is Derek Smart? Well, take the physique of Laurence Fishburne (the Morfeus of the Matrix) and merge it with the genius and madness of a John Carmak and you have Smart. Probably one of the most talked about characters of the video game scene, both for the arrogance often shown in the approach with his works, and for the ambition shown in wanting to build a ~total~ game at all costs, which could close once and for all. all the talk of a 360-degree space simulation. There are numerous web pages around the net where Smart is adored as an absolute genius and others in which he is mocked by games or photomontages, just like the referee Moreno. All this can only indicate what level of notoriety this character has received all over the world.", "date": "2004-06-15", "grade": null}
