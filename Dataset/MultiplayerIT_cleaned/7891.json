There are those who have taken advantage of it to create original and crazy experiences (an example above all still remains Fingle), or those who have limited themselves to recreating games such as Subbuteo or table hockey in a digital version. And precisely these last two seem to somehow meet in Slamjet Stadium, the new mobile title from the all-rounder developer Alistair Aitcheson. The project was born from the desire of the English author to allow two friends to interact on the same device: ~In the games of the past~, said Alistair, ~you had your controller and I had mine, but if we share the same space why divide the game into two parts?~. A space sport On the first appointment with Slamjet Stadium, one cannot help but be a little disoriented: having to juggle between programming, design and graphics, Aitcheson has given the game the same somewhat rough and confusing look as his previous title for iOS, the puzzle Greedy Bankers vs the world. You get used to the messy aesthetic in a few seconds, and when everything is in motion you even end up appreciating it, but it's just when you start the first game that you realize how chaotic the game actually is. Table hockey and Subbuteo, we said: in Slamjet Stadium the player leads a team made up of two members, and the aim is to get the ball into the opponent's goal; the team that first reaches a pre-established number of points (usually three) wins. On board bizarre means of transport, your avatars must be moved by ~slinging~ them in a similar way to what was seen in Angry Birds. Dragging a finger backwards adjusts the power and direction of the shot, but from the options it is possible to reverse the control system to make it more similar to that of Subbuteo. So far everything is regular, if not downright banal, but where Slamjet Stadium stands out is in the unpredictability of events and in the way power-ups can turn an entire match upside down. There is for example the inevitable Multiball, which as in Breakout multiplies the spheres on the screen making the game a real scramble, or an option called Magnet, which as the name suggests transforms the members of a team into a magnet for the ball. Or there are even more exaggerated ones: Gust unleashes a gust of wind that pushes the ball towards one of the two goals, while Last Man Standing sends rotating blades or laser beams into the field that can knock out. characters until only one remains. These power-ups must be activated with a touch as soon as they appear in the center of the screen, but the player must choose the most opportune moment since, if he is not careful, he risks favoring the opponent. And believe us, especially in the most frenetic games, the hunger for power-ups can lead to sensational own goals. To the events to be activated manually are added the environmental dangers that characterize some arenas. From jets of air to black holes, from lava pools to bouncy platforms. In one of the most interesting, for example, the two doors are constantly changing position, leading to incredible moments of hilarity or frustration. Just imagine a last-minute goal blown into an empty net or, worse still, your goal suddenly appearing where you pushed the ball. If these sadistic mechanics work well in the solitude of the single-player mode, Slamjet Stadium is at its best in the company of a friend. If you want you can face the championship in single player playing in the same team, but Aitcheson has provided a competitive option designed specifically to break friendships and maybe break a few iPads. One of the arenas in multiplayer features a flashing siren that activates when the ball is affected by tilting the device. Thus, at the signal, the players begin a real fight for possession of the iPad, using every means and sinister trick to get the upper hand. Obviously, competitive matches always risk becoming a real bedlam, either because four hands easily obstruct the view, or because the opponent can cheat at any time and drive your avatars away. But deep down that's what makes Slamjet Stadium such a unique game, and it certainly mirrors the author's original vision of trying to create an atypical multiplayer experience. And if you don't have the opportunity to play in company, the title has its sides well protected even in the single-player campaign, given the amount of challenges, arenas, opponentsand difficulty levels. You can choose between different teams, each with specific characteristics, and there is even a narrative background full of humor and funny quotes.", "date": "2013-04-18", "grade": "8.5"}
