{"name": "Il Pianeta del Tesoro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-pianeta-del-tesoro.html", "text": "Solar Surfin' The Bizarre Creations title is basically a platform game. In the role of the young Jim Hawkins we will have to face a series of levels consisting of five primary objectives each; each completed mission activates a ~beacon~, the collection of which is necessary for the continuation in the advanced levels. The feature that immediately catches the eye is the subdivision into two types of levels: traditional platform sessions and sessions aboard the Solar Surfer, a sort of windsurfing equipped with retro-rockets. In the first we will guide the protagonist through levels of increasing complexity. In each mission there are specific objectives, including paths in the more classic platform style to be completed, destruction of meteorites and the like thanks to a cannon, ~stealth~ sessions and activation of certain switches using particular power-ups. In fact, together with good Jim travels a floating little creature (similar to the Cupil of Skies of Arcadia) capable of transforming itself, thanks to special altars, into a vast range of power-ups with a limited time of a few tens of seconds, among which the arms -cyborg, a flying hand needed to activate particular levers and a small jetpack to reach otherwise unattainable heights. Furthermore, in each mission there are beacons which, in order to be activated, require the collection of a certain number of golden doubloons and ten green energies, which are subtracted from the player in the event of death. In the levels aboard the Solar Surfer, in addition to objectives such as the search for doubloons and green energy, there are races against time and a series of energy rings to be inserted in succession. Thanks to the Solar Surfer it is possible to reach considerable speeds and a good number of actions can be performed including jumping, lowering the sail to avoid obstacles, the possibility of grinding beams and performing various aerial tricks. A Bizarre Creation Graphically The Treasure Planet looks very good. The polygonal structures are sufficiently complex and covered with good textures, the game environment is quite large even if there is a clear contrast between the ~active~ part and the background. The settings are diversified and some are very inspired. The design from 19th century England faithfully follows, for better or for worse, the animated film and the characters are well modeled and animated. Among the defects recognizable in the graphics sector there are a slight draw-in involving objects in the distance, the tendency to present textures with too dark colors, unlike the classic palette of Disney feature films and, in certain situations, a camera that is not too stable which puts the player in difficulty dealing with sections based on precision jumps; the key to bring the view back to Jim Hawkins is also too abrupt, risking making the younger ones lose their sense of orientation. However, it should be noted that the frame rate is always constant, even during the most hectic phases on board the Solar Surfer. The music is of good quality, especially those taken directly from the film, while those specially packaged for the game are sometimes repetitive, but in general it is a well-made soundtrack. The sound effects are average, while the voice acting is quite accurate. The difficulty is, in my opinion, very well calibrated. Treasure Planet is never frustrating but it is very often challenging, especially considering the target audience. There are not a few game sessions in which every single move must be calibrated, especially during the more markedly platform phases and some races against time. The respawn of enemies, or their rebirth in the event of the player's death, and the still moderate difficulty of some sections balance the ease deriving from the availability of infinite lives. The game levels are well designed, despite a marked linearity, they always allow the freedom to wander far and wide in search of the last gold doubloon. Just the search sections of the objects are those that allow the player to memorize the structure of the level. There is no shortage of fights against the ~bosses~, consisting mainly of puzzles that are never too complicated and sequences to be repeated several times. As for longevity, the Bizarre Creations title can last between 10 and 15 hours of actual play. Comment Ultimately, Treasure Planet is a classic and honest platformer, suitable for an audience of teenagers but fun even for the most savvy. A respectable technical sector is accompanied by a well-balanced difficulty and a very healthy gameplay. Definitely recommended to all Disney enthusiasts, to those who have been fascinated by the feature film and to lovers of platformers with a simple structure; not recommended for those looking exclusively for challenge and originality, especially considering the presence on Playstation2 of titles such as Ratchet & Clank and the next Sly Cooper. Pros + Fun and well balanced + Satisfactory technical section + Undoubtedly satisfying sections on board the SolarSurfer Cons - Nothing overly original - Too simple for veterans of the genre - Too dark colors to be a Disney game Originality has never been the main feature of videogame transpositions of Disney feature films. Horizontally scrolling platformers (in the 16bit era) and three-dimensional adventures (since the advent of Playstation) have never detached themselves too much from the same game structure. Yet, in the past, the immediacy and underlying simplicity of the gameplay have not prevented you from enjoying real gameplay pearls such as Quackshot and World of Illusion. And Il Pianeta del Tesoro seems to focus precisely on structural simplicity which, while not reaching peaks of excellence, could fall into the same category.", "date": "2003-01-07", "grade": null}
