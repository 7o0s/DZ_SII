{"name": "Expeditions: Rome", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/expeditions-rome-recensione.html", "text": "We are in the late Republican era and in Rome, while its military power allows it to expand throughout the Mediterranean, conspiracies and frictions between the most powerful families are multiplying internally. The situation is explosive: the gap between rich and poor widens and many soldiers seem to be more loyal to their commanders than to Rome itself. The story of the protagonist, the son of a patrician house who escaped a conspiracy in which his father lost his life, begins in this not exactly tranquil scenario. To save himself he had to leave for Greece, where a campaign is underway against some rebels, fomented by King Mitriade of Pontus. From a simple privileged man, ours will have to become a real commander, to return to Rome and do justice to what happened to his family. In short, this is the story that forms the backdrop to the latest effort by Logic Artists. In the review of Expeditions: Rome we will try to explain the hybrid nature of this interesting project. Hybrid gameplay The general map where parties and troops move Logic Artists' title fluctuates continuously between being an RPG and a strategy game, with the user not only having to take care of a party of well-characterized characters, all with their own stories, but also having to manage an army guiding him on the battlefield, albeit indirectly. As was the case in Expeditions: Conquistador and Expeditions: Vikings, the previous games in the series, the game scenario is part historical and part pure fiction. So expect to meet personalities of the time, that you will surely have known from school books, who collaborate with fake characters, created ad hoc for the game. In terms of gameplay, we are faced with a very varied title, which offers many systems and which has as its main defect precisely that of not delving into some of them. Let's say that the experience as a whole turns out to be intriguing, for the reasons that we will explain, but that sometimes one really feels the need to delve into some aspects, especially the strategic ones. As an RPG, Expeditions: Rome is very reminiscent of the Baldur's Gate formula, albeit with the appropriate differences. So exploratory phases framed from above in well-defined areas alternate with others of pure combat and still others in which we are called to make choices, often radical, which determine not only the unfolding of some events, but also the relationship between us and our subordinates. Let's say that here the work done by the developers stands out very much to make the story as interesting as possible, even in the theoretically weakest moments. In particular we see a great effort to make the events more interesting, as they have very strong designs. The thing stands out in particular for the fights. So on many occasions winning doesn't mean having to defeat the enemy, but achieving different objectives, such as setting fire to a certain number of ships, defending a character, reducing the escort of a particularly strong enemy in order to isolate him and so on. In this, turn-based combat, based on the expenditure of action points, helps a lot, which has allowed the designers to think about the various topical moments in a much more strategic way than could have been hoped. Exploration The combat system offers several opportunities The exploration itself is divided into several levels: that of the general map, where you can reach the different places, but you can also collect resources from the various points of interest, as well as participate in events from which you can derive benefits or penalties (for example, attacking adult wild boars increases food supplies, but can injure one of our companions); that of the individual places, where you can find sellers, obtain missions and information or fight, which are then one of the cornerstones of the experience. These last phases are in fact the most interesting, because they allow us to get in touch with the secondary stories of our travel companions, or to discover the internal discontents of the territories we have to occupy. Most of the dialogues also take place here, strictly multiple choice, and the events in which we will have to decide concretely what kind of commander to be. The missions deserve particular praise, all in line with the role of the main character (technically he is a legatus of Rome). So not only do the other characters tend to show the respect that our role requires, but they would never dream of asking us to go pick herbs or clean a cellar of mice. Throughout the game we will therefore find ourselves taking part in conspiracies, trying to find traitors or infiltrating high-risk territories.hey. It is a refreshing choice, to be honest, which goes against the current trend of having heroes who have to save the world carry out miserable missions, just to add content and lengthen the broth. Combat system There are several areas to explore As mentioned, the combat system of Expeditions: Rome is based on a turn-based model, which recalls the classics of the genre, such as Divinity: Original Sin II (with the appropriate differences). At the beginning of each fight we are given the opportunity to position ourselves in an area of the map, so we have to make all our units act, making them move, making them attack, using their skills and the objects obtained by exploring or in the Roman camps (which serve as operational bases). Once our turn is over, the ball is up to the opponents. All characters have a skill tree that determines their class and usefulness on the battlefield. For example Beast Tabat is a former gladiator well versed in combat, while Julia Calida is an excellent spy for surprise attacks and to use bows. Over time (it took us about 56 hours to finish Expeditions Rome) and the accumulation of experience points, new skills will be unlocked, which will make the fights more and more varied and engaging in their own way, thanks also to the strong narrative of many of they. To top it all off, the many side systems take care of it, which make the micromanagement of the party deeper than we expected. Naturally around there are objects to improve our equipment and that of our companions, moreover often linked to specific skills. So we have well-designed clashes, often with multiple objectives, in which to use characters with skills both personal, both linked to their objects, and linked to the opportunities given by the map itself. The strategic side There is no shortage of variety As an RPG Expeditions: Rome works really well. Of course, some explorable areas could have offered a few more interactions or secrets, but in general there is little to complain about, also given the high number of places that can be visited. Less successful, in our opinion, is the strategic side. Basically we will soon get the command of a legion, which we will have to use to conquer some territories. Our army will be manageable from the camps (actually always the same one that follows us from conquest to conquest), where we will be able to replace lost troops, hire generals to lead them into battle (each with bonuses and malus related to class and personality), distribute rations and study our next moves. Note that the camp is expandable, i.e. you can purchase additional buildings to increase your army and party upgrade options. The problems begin when you take the field, because in reality the fights are not managed directly, but through a series of tactical decisions with uncertain outcomes, aimed at favoring the various aspects that can determine victory or defeat. The system itself is not very deep and we confess that we have often resorted to automatic resolution, that is, we have had everything managed by the CPU, especially in secondary battles, which in the long run almost become a nuisance compared to everything else. Graphics Technically Expeditions: Rome isn't great, but it isn't bad either From a technical point of view Expeditions: Rome is a game without infamy and without praise. Let's say that graphically it is not amazing, even though it presents quite detailed and well-characterized environments, as well as well-constructed. Even the artistic direction is quite anonymous and functional, and never offers particular virtuosity. It's okay, for an AA budget top-down RPG, but don't expect miracles or to be wowed by characters or landscapes. The same goes for the soundtrack, which is limited to being a decent accompaniment to the action and nothing more. Finally, a few words should be spent on cleaning up the title, which turned out to be very high. There are some bugs, but nothing really decisive or destructive to the gaming experience. Of course, maybe we are among the lucky players, while others have had a worse life than ours. In any case, we can tell you that we have reached the end of the game without unrecoverable blocks and without having encountered bugs that have forced us to throw away some saves. That's not a small thing these days.", "date": "2022-01-18", "grade": "8.3"}
