{"name": "Cronache marziane", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118131-mars-war-logs-cronache-marziane.html", "text": "If you are a fan of science fiction films, you will certainly have your preferences in terms of blockbuster and independent productions, without one category necessarily excluding the other. Certainly, especially from the nineties onwards, the genre has clearly divided between films produced with investments and important names, and the considerable undergrowth made up of independent films, the result of the work of emerging directors and actors. Thus, for every Avatar or Oblivion there is a Pitch Black and a District 9, which, since they don't necessarily have to interest the general public in order to recoup their investments, can afford more mature themes and less playful atmospheres. Although in the field of video games science fiction is often the prerogative of large publishers, there are some interesting exceptions, both bizarre and unexpected (FTL is a prime example), and middle ground, i.e. non-indie products in the true sense of the term, but nonetheless made with the proverbial formula ~little money and lots of ideas~. Mars: War Logs belongs to this last category, a production signed by Spiders Studios, a software house based in Paris that made itself known with two graphic adventures dedicated to Sherlock Holmes and the unfortunate (but interesting) RPG Of Orcs and Men . Even before its release, Mars: War Logs managed to gather a fair amount of interest around it, both because the conclusion of the Mass Effect and Dead Space trilogies opened up a fair void for all gamers who are passionate about science fiction, and because of the promises made by the developers, who have long talked about the return to mature themes and a very classic western role-playing system, based on moral choices. The result is a production unfortunately not without defects, some of which are of far from secondary importance, but still interesting in many respects, certainly able to stand out from the crowd. Red planet Like any good self-respecting role-playing video game, Mars: War Logs is supported by a massive narrative component, capable of reserving some original implications. For example, the idea of introducing the protagonist in a deliberately smoky way is brilliant, making the player start the adventure without knowing much about his origins. This envelops Roy Temperance in an aura of undoubted charm, and also grants total freedom in making subsequent moral choices, never influenced by the protagonist's personality, at the same time strong but never cumbersome, able to adapt perfectly to the various ways of interpreting him that multiple choices offer. The planet Mars imagined by the designers of Spiders is a depressed, dusty, undone place. There isn't much room for hope between the streets of the various urban agglomerations that Roy and the young supporting actor Innocence will find themselves crossing, constantly threatened by the different forces in conflict. The adventure is divided into three main chapters, the first of which will be entirely dedicated to escaping from the prison in which the two are. After this first phase, where moral choices will present themselves less frequently, the following two will open up to a complex game of interests and powers, with the protagonist forced to choose which of the various factions to ally with. Although the story can take different turns depending on the choices made, from an exploratory point of view the game maintains an almost excessive uniformity. Each location, whether it is the prison or the subsequent colonies, is divided into neighborhoods and by as many loads. Although the rusty look and the desolate urban contexts retain their charm for the duration of the story, the similarities between one setting and another are often exaggerated, giving the player the impression of always being in the same place. On the one hand it is a choice, with the developers intending to characterize the planet while maintaining certain peculiarities, such as the color palette and the post-industrial look, on the other hand there is a truly excessive landscape monotony. For its part, the plot of Mars: War Logs suffers from a similar problem. As much as we note the efforts made by the developers to create an original story, and we appreciate the distance from the epic events that usually characterize RPGs in favor of slightly less choral events, many of the characters struggle to emerge. Also due to a bad English dubbing (with Italian subtitles) and a deficient screenplay, especially as regards the actual dialogues, with the exception of the protagonist and the supporting actor, the remaining personalities are clouded, with consequent problems when it will be a question of choosing from which part stay. This is a real pity, especially if we consider that the work done on the background, with the complex events that have led humanity to live in poverty on the red planet well explained, is instead remarkable. The Witcher on Mars? The fights are a fundamental component of the playful offer of Mars: War Logs. In other words, when you don't find yourself looking for specific objects or talking, you will most likely be brandishing a weapon, trying to survive in clear numerical inferiority. Whether it's main or secondary missions, most of the time the means to achieve one's goal will be limited to confronting a good number of opponents. At the base of the combat system there is a solid hack'n'slash system, where melee represents the primary resource for dealing with enemies, who are also mostly equipped with blunt weapons. Although it does not reach the levels of complexity and refinement, the combat system of Mars: War Logs is in some ways inspired by that of the last chapter of the Witcher's adventures. Both the focus on close combat weapons, which represent the main resource for the entire duration of the adventure, and the quick menu that gives access to secondary skills and tools, which is activated by holding down a key and slows down the passage of time, leaving the player time to come up with a strategy. The standard slash is accompanied by a somersault useful for dodging enemy blows and a parry, which allows you to develop a counter-move by attacking immediately after having suffered an attack. Although the possibilities increase in the later stages of the game, adding a nail gun to strike from a distance and the technomancer glove, which allows you to attack with electricity or take cover with an energy shield, overall the combat ends up being solid but excessively monotonous. The feedback returned by the melee clashes is positive but, especially from the middle of the adventure onwards, the lack of growth in the system will be strongly felt. The progressive release of skills divided into three trees (defense, attack and Technomancy) would seem to indicate the opposite, but the variety of tactics available will soon be too limited. In general, there is an excessive importance given to attacks from behind and dodging, which forces the player to constantly use the somersault, with a negative effect also on the visual feedback of the fights, which are far from spectacular. On the other hand, the possibility of advancing in stealth has been almost completely wasted, as it grants at most the limited advantage constituted by a surprise attack, generally very little useful in clashes. On the other hand, the management of the learning curve is more positive, well balanced so that the player slowly learns to face increasingly difficult and numerous groups of enemies and emerge victorious. The contribution of the companions, who will be able to fight alongside Roy, is instead not very incisive, as they will often end up incapacitated after a few seconds, leaving the player with the task of finishing the job. Limited resources Although Mars: War Logs cannot be defined as a survival game, there are certainly some aspects of this genre that the developers have decided to integrate into the combat system, above all the lack of ammunition for the nail gun and medical kits, which are rather rare. The main weapon available to the protagonist is always a blunt object of various kinds, which can often be improved with makeshift components through the simple crafting system. Using a certain amount of resources including metal alloys, strips of leather and other elements, directly from the inventory it will be possible to improve the attack and defense characteristics of the blunt weapon, provided that this allows it. The same principle applies to armor, which can also be upgraded in real time. The necessary resources will be to be recovered both from the bodies of defeated enemies and in the containers and piles of waste that dot the settings, making it advisable to carefully explore the surroundings of each level. Instead, the trading system is based on a currency known as Serum, to which an interesting mechanic applies. By limiting yourself to receiving the quantities of Serum linked to the completion of missions and the occasional random finds, the player's economic resources will be rather limited, but there is a way to obtain it in quantity. Since defeated enemies do not die at the end of a fight, but simply remain unconscious on the ground, the player can decide to finish them off using a special siringa, which will also return a certain amount of serum. Easy riches, therefore, but at a price, given that Roy's reputation will drop with each murder, subsequently triggering even strong reactions among some factions and influencing the course of history, clearly in the negative. However, even playing the part of the good Samaritan has its drawbacks, given that the enemies will come to their senses after a few minutes and will return to patrol the area. Given the massive backtracking that many missions require, this will lead to a lot of time-consuming travel. From a graphic point of view, the PC version we tested did not fully satisfy us. Technically, the Spiders Studios' proprietary Silk Engine does not reach the current standards in terms of polygonal modeling and effects (there is DirectX 11 support, but no decisive effects are noticed in terms of overall yield), although the glance overall is not bad. This, above all thanks to the good design, which despite the previously mentioned monotony manages to give the red planet a washed-out, post-industrial and unhealthy look, perfectly in line with the cyberpunk tones of the work. Although there are therefore no individual memorable elements in the context, the alchemy of the individual parts manages to work, creating an undoubtedly new mix. The lightness of the engine will undoubtedly allow it to be used even on non-updated machines, without major sacrifices in terms of graphic settings.", "date": "2013-05-06", "grade": "7.2"}
