{"name": "Half-Life 2: Episode One - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/half-life-2-episode-one-recensione.html", "text": "when you get to the end you feel something is missing, you want to know how the story will end and you share Alyx's fate as well as your own There is episode and episode After thoroughly playing Sin Episodes: Emergence (not that it took that long) we had become deeply dubious about the episodic release formula of the games. The fundamental question we asked ourselves was: will we ever see Alexis Sinclair naked? (has anyone ever seen her dressed?) Ahem, no (today there's just no way to write something serious... Ugh). The question was, how are they going to keep interest in all nine episodes? Of course, the answer only came after playing Episode One; that is, after having ascertained that such a formula can only work if a first-class job is carried out in terms of characterization of the characters and the game world. Probably Valve started with an advantage because it had a more solid background available than that of Ritual, but reducing everything to this would mean diverting from the crux of the matter. Emotional issues Let's take Alyx. At the beginning of the game, he manifests joy in seeing us again. She doesn't just tell us ~ah how happy I am~ but she shows it to us by ~reciting~ her happiness. Alyx interacts with us and with Dog. His behavior is not only plausible, but also extremely ~human~ (in the dramaturgical sense of the term). Right from the start we begin to really feel her as an adventure ~companion~ and not as a girl put there by programmers to keep us company. We are in the same boat but it is she who leads us into the action. The relationship that develops between Gordon and Alyx is complex. In his approach to us (us understood as Gordon) many feelings transpire that are developed throughout the adventure: concern, affection, trust, fear, esteem and others. It's wonderful to get through a difficult section and have Alyx tell you ~I knew you could do it~, watching her face relax after the supposed tension. Beyond the plot itself (being able to escape from the city carrying an object for Eli Vance), what fascinates is this development of the bond of the characters through continuous and never forced interactions (in a word they could be defined as ~natural~, although it is difficult to give a complete and clear meaning to this word in a video game). Sometimes a single joke is enough to create an atmosphere of complicity that dilutes the moments of pure action. Alyx soon becomes a figure to be fond of; towards it we begin to develop a kind of protective instinct (even if along the game it will prove not to need it) which leads us to consider it ~important~ beyond the action itself. That is: in Emergence, in the sections in which Blade is accompanied by his colleague, the latter is not paid much attention to; as soon as it is understood that it is immortal, one leaves it on its own without considering it too much and without caring about its fate. When the paths of the two divide, you don't even notice. This is why, when we get to the finale, we don't participate in what should actually be a drama (we won't tell you about it in case you want to play it but it's easily imaginable). The only reason you might want to play the second episode of the series is because you had fun shooting around. Emotional issues In Episode One it is different. When you get to the end you feel you are missing something, you want to know how the story will end and you share Alyx's fate as well as your own (this is also thanks to a very clever move made by Valve: immediately release a video of Episode Two in which shows Alyx in danger of life). In short, apart from the game itself, Episode Two makes sense because it will fill the ~void~ (emotional and knowledge) left by the end of Episode One, telling us ~how it ends~ and creating another void that will be filled in Episode Three and so on until the end. Voices from the depths Too bad only for the Italian dubbing. Unfortunately, while informed by the players of the boot on the bad work done for Half-Life 2, Valve (or whoever for them) has confirmed the same team of voice actors. The result is more than a cut below the English version where, however, the voice acting is perfect and the voices are splendid. It's a real shame, given that hearing the inexpressive and often toneless voices of the Italian version (sometimes even ridiculous) makes you lose many nuances of that mechanism that we described in the previous paragraph. Perhaps they will have worried about the continuity with the voices of the past ... but, honestly, who would have worried and who would not have liked the use of professionals instead of voice actorsdo you improvise? Aware then of the fact that infinitely inferior productions use better voice actors (see all the titles distributed on newsstands by Power Up) the defect becomes even more marked. In short, what in other games would be considered a secondary issue here becomes quite annoying since the dialogues are very frequent and are very important. Voices from the depths Speaking of real action, it is impossible not to mention Valve's ability to exploit the physics engine not only as a mere aesthetic element: many puzzles have been placed throughout the game that force the player to ingenuity to be overcome, and many of these they will require the exploitation of this by now very abused physics which, elsewhere, is often used badly and inappropriately. Just to give an example, in one level we will have to use the Gravity Gun to be able to plug the holes from which the Antlions come out. Obviously we won't tell you how, but we assure you that it is a lot of fun to do it and, above all, in this way it pays tribute to this technology which, more and more often, struggles to find a meaning to its existence, beyond that of making the engines excessively heavy graphs. unfortunately, although informed by the players of the boot on the bad job done for Half-Life 2, Valve has confirmed the same team of voice actors Hardware boxes Half-Life 2: Episode One is a very advanced title from a technical point of view which, however, does not require a super computer to run. Thanks to the scalability of the Source, a 1400 MHz processor with 256 MB of ram and a 3D card with 64 MB will be enough to get it going. Obviously with this configuration you will be able to set only the minimum detail. To enjoy all the graphic goodies (how can we not mention the splendid pulsating core of the Citadel?), bring the processor to 3 GHz, the memory to 1 GB (the more you have, the better) and equip yourself with a second-to-last or latest video card generation with at least 256 MB. As with all Source-based games, there's a big risk that you'll experience audio-related stuttering. In this case the advice is always the same: lower the audio quality and/or follow the same procedures of the previous episode to try to optimize everything (just edit the configuration files). Half-Life 2: Episode One can be purchased directly from Steam, Valve's DD platform, and in stores. Final comment What can I say Valve confirms itself as a leader in the creation of FPS and manages to convince even where others have not convinced at all. Episode One is splendid and, for what it lasts, manages to keep you glued to the screen without ever frustrating and always keeping the interest very high. The final grade deserves a separate discussion. The overall judgment would actually be 9.0 and not 8.7. The three votes less are assigned to the Italian version which has a bad dubbing. If you can, play with English audio, you will enjoy the game even more. Pros Perfect narration Physics is finally used in an intelligent way Technically excellent Cons The dubbing of the Italian version is a crime Brief They could have added at least one new weapon Who's back... Episode One is a FPS divided into five not very long chapters (about six hours in total duration) and allows for the first time to admire the Source (it is Valve's proprietary graphics engine, for those who don't know what we are talking about) with all the new features activated (Lost Coast aside, of course) in a commercial game. As the usual Gordon Freeman we will have to be able to escape from the Citadel (the place where Half-Life 2 ended) and, therefore, from City 17, before the destruction of the entire city. Together with the Doc there will also be Alyx who will share almost the entire adventure with him (they will only split for short stretches) and will play an active role both in combat and in solving some puzzles. Obviously there will be many of the other characters already encountered in the previous Half-Life (Dog, Barney, the G-Man, Eli Vance plus various others). The arsenal available to our hero is the one we have already known in the previous episode, without relevant variations, just as the enemies are always the same, apart from the Zombine (a combination between the headcrab and the Combine... ahem, the name Alyx gave it to him by making a joke, put those bats on...) Having done this quick summary of what Episode One is, let's examine it more in depth. So, the microscope is on the table, the CT scan machine is in the next room and the naked nurse who will assist me in the task is on the bed.. but let's not beat around the bush.", "date": "2006-06-07", "grade": null}
