{"name": "Everybody's Golf World Tour - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/everybodys-golf-world-tour-recensione.html", "text": "Watch out for the bat The first feature implemented regarding the new control method (advanced shots) which supports the classic one with the power bar at the bottom. It is now possible to decide the power of the shot simply by observing the player's swing, pressing X at the right time. In the same way, press X again when a circular indicator is correctly tightened on the ball. Getting the times of both pressures wrong will result in a simply bad shot: the game underlines the ominous technical gesture with an out of tune piano note combined with a flash with a decidedly hilarious negative photographic effect. This new system, after the first moments of disorientation, is certainly preferable to the classic one, above all because it makes shooting control much more simulative and fun. Although the power bar works very well as usual, the fun guaranteed by choosing the strength of the shot by carefully looking at the swing of your alter ego is much higher. In short, after a few games, the traditional method will seem like a relic of the past, so the first innovation went well. Watch out for the bat Even the system for applying the effect is quite simple and immediate, it is not necessary, as in a sort of billiard game, to indicate the exact point where to hit the ball, but just use the arrows on the directional cross to decide the area of impact and you're done. Obviously there are also a whole series of variables that contribute to the successful execution of the shot: the wind is the main destabilizing factor, to overcome this or one's being a wimp, the game allows us to buy new clubs (more or less performing) and especially improve the skills of our player. A minimum of upgrading of your character's skills is possible, thus touching values such as strength, accuracy and so on. The final impression is that the goodness of the shot is not just the result of pressing a key in time, but a concerted work of many factors, a good result for a title that focuses on the ~arcade~ style and ease of use. If a certain degree of technical customization of the player is possible, it is not possible, at least in the off-line modes, to play with the golfers' look. As the game progresses, different versions of the chosen avatar will become available, with different clothing and accessories, little consolation for those who wanted to spend time between hairstyles, Bermuda shorts and strange hats. All together to write in the lobby! However, when you access the online part of Hot Shot Golf, the situation is partially reversed. Multiplayer is the other great feature of the Clap Handz title. Before facing 8 human opponents in a game or a maximum of 50 in a tournament, you access a lobby where you can invite or simply talk to other players. Here, you will have the opportunity to indulge yourself with the appearance of your alter ego in all those previously denied ways. The items available to play fashion with your character will increase as the game progresses, both online and offline. Unfortunately, voice chat has not been implemented in the lobby, thus forcing the player to use the pad or connect a USB keyboard. When it comes to playing, given the likelihood of embarking on rather crowded sessions, all the contenders play at the same time: it is possible to choose whether or not to see the opponents' shots, but more generally this game system serves to eliminate dead times by avoiding to wait your turn. All together to write in the lobby! After this long excursus on the novelties of the title, it is appropriate to talk about the sensations felt pad in hand. The good job of diversifying the courses created by the developers is immediately evident, putting our golfing skills to the test. Hilltops, bunkers, bridges, ponds and streams are all positioned to ensure that there is no sudden and frustrating jump in difficulty level. Everything is very easy and intuitive: whether you choose the classic control or the advanced one, you can play immediately with gusto, having a lot of fun, and learning in a short time to calculate all the variations in play. A very useful view from above, combined with that at ground level, allows the player to study the shot with extreme simplicity, avoiding bad impressions and lopsided shots. Only 6 courses are available (to be played in challenge, stroke and training modes), a not too large number if taken alone, but which acquires value when seen from the perspective of the title's broad replayability and multiplayer games. Playing one gets the impression of not having a s in the handssimple arcade title: the new control method, the many possibilities to grow one's character and the excellent implementation of the ball physics, makes Everybody's Golf World Tour look like a clear arcade game unbalanced on the simulation side. It is therefore a miracle that none of the two souls of the title conflict, finding instead an absolutely functional point of balance. All together to write in the lobby! Graphically, the game is all a succession of good things and other rather normal ones, which despite being well done don't make you cry out for a miracle. The design of the characters is the best thing about the title, as are their animations in the name of excessive gestures dear to Japanese animation. After each shot we will see our caddy rushing to the place of arrival of the ball at unrestrained speed, shaking his legs as if it were Beep Beep, stopping out of breath in oxygen debt! The golfers are all dressed in an eccentric way, nothing to do with Prince of Wales suits and austere white polo shirts, they often and willingly tear a smile. If the paths available denounce an excellent level design, the same cannot be said for the textures that cover them. Not that they are awkward and badly made but one passes with ease from excellent effects of light and shadow, grass and polygonal foliage, to spaces in which flat surfaces reign with little or no signs of special effects. There are also some flickering issues, which are evident when accessing top-down views. However, all these small criticisms are lost in a very colorful, cartoony, but more generally lively and vibrant general context, which will not be the emblem of the graphics power of Playstation 3, but which does its job extremely well. Comment Everybody's Golf World Tour is a pleasant surprise, a sports title that has been able to renew itself while maintaining all the characteristics that have consecrated it in past years. All the novelties included in this first release on the Sony flagship blend perfectly with the already tested mechanics, making both lovers of pure and hard simulation happy, and those who prefer lighter and arcade mechanics. An excellent multiplayer sector and a good level of character growth are pluses that only increase the goodness of the work of the Clap Handz. Ultimately the title is extremely fun, immediate, rather deep and never superficial. The only discordant notes are the lack of voice chat in the multiplayer lobby and a good graphics sector, which could have been more daring, but which still fulfills its purpose. Pros Immediate and fun New control method Excellent Multiplayer sector Cons Graphic sector in some parts not exceptional Only 6 courses", "date": "2008-03-27", "grade": null}
