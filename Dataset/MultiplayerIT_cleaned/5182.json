{"name": "DoDonPachi Resurrection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/176076-dodonpachi-resurrection-fuoco-a-tappeto.html", "text": "The birth of the genre of danmaku, or bullet hell, or manic shooter or whatever, is traced back to 1993, with the release of Toaplan's Batsugun. Until then, the classic shoot'em up or shump (then tell us we don't give you options), horizontally or vertically or multidirectionally scrolling, had been conceived in a very different way: with the difficulty linked to the scenarios, to the single enemies and their intertwining. Remember that you have to die. And die. And die. And die. The genre was in commercial decline, at least in the West (in the East somehow it still exists) and what we can consider its latest variant specialized it to the point of making it repellent to the masses over time, masses who even in the eighties had decreed the success of titles such as R-Type, Darius, Nemesis and many others, especially in the arcade. The novelty introduced by Batsugun was easy to spot: the enemies were no longer limited to firing single shots, but filled the screen with bullets that followed precise and insidious geometric patterns. After the first few levels of apparent calm (usually two), Batsugun became a real hell. However, it was not Toaplan's title that made Bullet Hell love, but Cave's first DoDonPachi, released in 1997 (actually a sequel to 1995's DonPachi). The success was such, at least at home, that from that moment Cave will become synonymous with danmaku, with dozens of dedicated titles, some of which have given rise to highly valuable mini-series. Just to name a few, let's remember ESP Ra. De., Guwange, Espgaluda, Mushihimesama and Deathsmiles. The Japanese developer has recently halted the production of new games, probably due to the inevitable decline in sales. Luckily, the emergence of markets such as mobile and PC on Steam have allowed the creation of ports that allow easier access to these titles, also succeeding in the noble intention of preserving them for future generations. They don't make big numbers, but they are there and this is the important thing. DoDonPachi Resurrection is without a doubt one of the best bullet hell on the market Incarnations DoDonPachi Resurrection is Cave's third shooter to arrive on Steam, after the aforementioned Mushihimesama and Deathsmiles. In our opinion it is also the best of the three. It tells the story of an android, Next EXY, who has gone back in time together with the Elemental Daughters, embodied in gigantic robots called Elemental Dolls. Will we be able to stop them? Sometimes the situation gets complicated But, above all, should they really be stopped? What are their goals? What are Colonel Godwin Longhener's orders actually hiding? It matters little. What matters is being able to overcome the six levels that make up the game, the last of which is a long battle with the extremely difficult final boss, learning to dodge the bullets that fill the screen as if there were no tomorrow. Judging a bullet hell isn't easy, because they're all apparently identical games. What differentiates one title from another? It is not easy to understand, at least at first glance. Let's say that fans of the genre particularly appreciate the difficulty of the proposed schemes, which make the genre very similar to a puzzle game, in which the precision of the moves and the ability to anticipate the attack schemes in order not to be found in a disadvantaged position. Those titles in which special attacks are related in some way to projectiles are also very popular. DoDonPachi Resurrection does both well. Let's be clear: it's very difficult, sometimes impossible. Even the two modes for novices, which we will briefly illustrate in the next paragraph, are not for everyone. Let's say that the first two levels are actually affordable, but then it becomes really hard to go on without losing lives over and over again. To do it, and it is not even said that you succeed, you have to learn to know your means. In this sense, the basic attack, the super bombs, the charged attack and the concentrated attack become part of a great puzzle game: their use must follow precise logic dictated by the circumstance. The resources available should not be wasted for any reason. Whether you succeed or not matters little, the important thing is to notice the progress made between one game and the next, pushing yourself to your limits. Despite the chaos, winning or losing is a matter of small balances. Hells DoDonPachi Resurrection offers a lot in terms of raw content. The latest incarnation of Cave's title has eight modes, each with its own unique characteristics. The basic version is Normal 1.5, which offers the original experience, but refined. Every modality has its own characteristics Then we have version 1.51, which has a different scoring system and merges the special attack buttons. The Arrange A (ver L) version, on the other hand, takes up the mechanics and ships of DoDonPachi Blissful Death. Arrange B (ver B) allows you to play the individual levels separately and customize them as needed. Black Label mode modifies the attack and the final boss. Black Label Arrange mode puts you in command of the Tigerschwert, one of the ships of another Cave bullet hell: Ketsui ~Kizuna Jigoku Tachi~ (note that this is the first time this mode officially leaves Japan). Finally there are the Novice and Black Label Novice modes, designed for the poorest players: the first is a simplified version of the Normal 1.5 mode, while the second of the Black Label mode. From a technical point of view, the title of Cave excels in its genre. Difficult to describe the beauty of the scenarios, but not because they are so well done that words fail. The problem is that it is difficult to see them under the blanket of bullets. On the other hand, the enemies are really well made, all children of an inspired design, the result of great experience. Especially the Elemental Dolls, which are the end-of-level bosses, are really very beautiful. However, the best technical element is also the one that is most present, but which is less noticeable. Over the years Cave has managed to refine itself by creating real fireworks displays with bullets, without ever sacrificing the readability of what is happening on the screen. Not for nothing are we talking about one of the most loved danmaku ever, which is considered one of the peaks of the entire genre. To top it all off there is also the evocative soundtrack, which you almost forget when playing, but which helps to create the dreamlike atmosphere that pervades the entire title.", "date": "2016-11-07", "grade": "9.0"}
