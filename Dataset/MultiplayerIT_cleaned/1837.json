Only one year after its introduction, ~the revolutionary FIFA 2002 passing system~, destroyer of tactics and constrictor (to avoid it) of the exclusive use of long steeple throws (also by the CPU, just to clarify), is been scaled down to the simple nickname of ~through ball~, leaving ample room for the old management which is now called ~intelligent pass~. And this system, as well as being intelligent, is simple, realistic and very intuitive: if you are running forward, to pass the ball to a player, just hint at a change of direction towards him and press the S key: it will be CPU to decide how powerful the pass will be and the right angle to get the ball to his feet. In this way an attacking action becomes a sequence of passes to free players which, combined with the dribbling described above, really give fantastic sensations. Be careful because if you miss an intelligent pass, for example by directing the player passing the ball in the wrong direction, the other teammates will inexplicably stop their run and run backwards... ~pessimism and annoyance~. Inevitable born negative: no more high passes. Also because hitting the header or making volleys is really a feat. The new idea implemented in FIFA 2003 is theoretically very simple: press the W key early enough to allow the player to jump and hit the ball at the right moment. In practice, it's a whole other story. First of all, if a high ball arrives and our player arrives under it only at the last moment, he will never jump, leaving the field free for the opponent's header. But above all the success rate of the headers is really low. Paradoxically, this translates into a completely opposite situation compared to FIFA 2002: where there were almost exclusively bell tower passes, now there are almost exclusively ground passes. Making a quick calculation, however, there is no doubt that this year the fun is much greater than in the previous chapter. Tiraaa! Unchanged from last year, shots on target are controlled by a power bar. In theory, if the indicator reaches the red zone, the ball should go outside, but in reality, things go differently: in front of goal, any power used still causes a certain goal (goalkeeper permitting), while from outside the area, even the green area near the red one, otherwise the shots will always end up outside the goal. However, it is curious (and realistic) to note how the red zone starts in different positions depending on the player used: Vieri or Batistuta, for example, have a ridiculously large red zone. This means that they will be able to make very powerful shots without risking mistakes (other players, with shots of the same power, have the indicator already in the middle of the red zone). Remaining in the field of ~shooting~, the real novelty of this year are the set pieces: first of all, with the arrow keys you have to bring an indicator to the precise point of the field or goal where you want to shoot the ball. Subsequently it is possible to establish the effect, using a second indicator on a box with the image of the ball to define the point of impact of the foot. This latest implementation is decidedly more realistic than the ~curved arrow~ of previous editions. Finally you have to press the D key to stop a pointer, which moves quickly within an arc, in the green area of the arc itself, so as to kick the ball with maximum precision (a picture is worth a thousand words , and you can find it among the screenshots). It's a lottery, that's for sure, but the practice and the effective randomness that is also found in the shots of real matches make this system better than the previous ones and a significant step forward in the general management of set pieces: moreover in time it will become easier and easier to hit the green wedge. One flaw is that substitutions and stats temporarily make the power indicators and crosshairs disappear in the field, unnecessarily slowing down the game (but not the game, because when you choose the aim the stopwatch stops). Forms and management With matches that are based on a dense series of passes, it is essential to be able to count on players in form and an optimal squad layout. For all this there is the ~Team Management~, which allows you to use a favorite game module and poter then select which players will occupy specific positions in the field. It is a system that has remained more or less unchanged over the years, with slight modifications from time to time that increasingly limit the imagination of a strategist. This year not only is it no longer possible, as in recent years, to select a completely customized game module, but it is also impossible, for most of the predefined modules, to choose whether you want to give your team an offensive attitude or defensive. So, for example, if you choose a 4-3-3, you won't be able to set up the defense with two men near the area and the other two on the wings, as happened last year, but they will generally remain on the line. The EA coach remained, who advises when to replace injured players (he's not always quick in his decisions, however) or tired players (it never happens). It can also suggest when to switch to different difficulty levels because you are clearly superior or inferior to your opponents. The artificial intelligence of teammates and opponents has remained similar to previous years as regards pressing: non-existent, except in the last minutes of the game, when tactical substitutions lead the team to have more offensive attitudes (if is losing) or defensive (if not). But now (finally!) most of the opposing actions also translate into a series of low shots. Arm raised and whistle! It is undeniable: there have been changes. The playability of FIFA 2003 has been completely changed compared to previous years and, I admit it, after endless denigrations we must acknowledge that the (few) advantages of the previous editions, combined with new initiatives, have brought FIFA 2003 to a new, solid and highest step to the top of the best soccer games. First of all, the fatigue of a player has undergone yet another change: fundamental three years ago, in the last two editions it has proved to be less and less useful. This year it is combined in a much more marked way with running (now obtainable with the E key compared to the W of previous editions): when you make a player dash forward making him run, the status bar will shrink more and more '. In reality, the uselessness has remained: it is practically impossible to bring a player to the limit and furthermore, once the race is over, the status bar fills up again. The race, on the other hand, has definitely changed. Running a player now makes him significantly more vulnerable to opposing tackles and much less maneuverable. All because ~shooting~ means stretching the ball a lot, with the consequent negative sides. Shooting on goal with a player who is running means risking too much time with a good chance of losing control of the ball. The same goes for sudden changes of direction or dribbling in front of opponents. It's a very nice modification, which introduces realism and above all avoids holding down the run button for the entire duration of the game, as was the case in previous editions. Let's move on to the mere management of the ball. FIFA 2002 was the forerunner, FIFA 2003 consecrated it in a big way: I'm referring to a player's control of the ball. Last year it was possible to ~attempt~ dribbles using the cursor keys. The result was almost always a disappointment, but the intention to give even more prominence to this realistic and intuitive game mode was clear. So it was, and FIFA 2003 allows you to attempt dribbling of all kinds (changes of direction, sprints and brakes, rotations and much more) exclusively with the arrow keys. A decisive implementation for better match management (you can waste time trying to serve an unmarked teammate, or you can find the right gap between two players to make a cross, etc.), the result is realistic even for those who defends: now a tackle against a player with his back will be practically impossible. You have to pass him first with a good run or risk a hard sliding intervention from behind. If to all this is added the Freestyle Control (American translated with ~I stretch~), usable by pressing the Shift key, the ball management possibilities for an attacker become complete. However, it is a pity that there is still no possibility of calling an offside: with a percentage of passes that has increased dramatically, ~cheating~ the opponents would have been more fun than we were allowed.", "date": "2003-01-04", "grade": null}
