It was enough to take the mascot of your favorite house, extol its virtues and bring your friends home to show them that exceptional title that they could never have on their gaming machine. Those who wanted to support Sega praised Sonic's qualities (actually already in decline) at the time and those who loved Nintendo spent hours describing Mario's unsurpassed level design (which, come to think of it, still happens today). PlayStation fans, on the other hand, didn't have a great tradition behind them and so they had found their icon in a strange marsupial with a few wheels out of place: Crash Bandicoot. Twenty years later the situation is profoundly different, not only for the battlefield of what are called fanboys. With a series of unexpected twists worthy of a thrilling thriller series, long-time gamers find themselves in a unique and, in the past, unimaginable condition: being able to play an excellent Sonic in 2D on a single console, an extraordinary Mario in 3D and, from June 29, 2018, the original Crash Bandicoot trilogy. The arrival of Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy on Nintendo Switch thus marks in some ways a historic moment, which unifies two decades of history under a single banner: but the porting made by Activision and Vicarious Visions will be up to such a big responsibility? Three games in one: the structure of the trilogy The Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy follows in all respects the contents seen a year ago on PlayStation 4, including the remakes of the original trilogy created by Naughty Dog between 1996 and 1998: on the initial screen it is in fact possible to choose whether to play Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back or Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. You can learn more about their structure and the main innovations, such as the presence of Coco as a playable character or the introduction of time trials in all levels, in our review of Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy for the Sony console, edited by Giordana Moroni. The three platformers are available immediately, as well as the two bonus levels of the collection are already unlocked: Stormy Ascent and Future Tense. The first is an extra level of the first chapter, recovered among those discarded by the original developers and released as free DLC for PlayStation 4 last July: a mix of infamous platforms and treacherous enemies that tests the patience of even the most skilled players , asking them too for a quick review of the calendar. The second is a completely new stage, created by Vicarious Visions precisely to celebrate the arrival on PC, Xbox One and, precisely, Switch: if faced immediately, this level is also particularly complex, given that it exploits some of the final enemies of the third chapter and a series of 2D platformers full of traps. If you decide to complete it with the various upgrades, however, the coefficient of challenge is significantly lowered, between bazooka shots and double jumps. Unless you decide to try to conquer the rarest relics with time trials, of course. Its presence is still a welcome addition, even if the derivative nature and the fact that it is also available for PlayStation 4 does not make Future Tense a point in favor of the port. Far from it. Graphics: the compromises of portability Vicarious Visions' work on the Crash Bandicoot trilogy has been excellent in many ways. We have said and reiterated several times, even in the recent Steam PC review: the US developers have managed to create a technically flawless remake, while maintaining the feeling, atmosphere and colors of the original games. You can even still perceive the evolution that the series has undergone over time, gradually becoming less frustrating and more varied in level design. The Nintendo Switch version is no different, even if it has to undergo a whole series of compromises derived from less performing hardware. Resolution in the dock, for example, looks subpar to the standard 1080p, with quite severe aliasing resulting in some flickering of background elements and noticeable jaggies in the shadows. The management of the lights itself is cruder than seen on the PlayStation 4, with the reflective surfaces that are thus duller and less realistic. This is a factor that also affects the gameplay: in the Future Tense level mentioned above, in fact, some metal panels reflect much less than they should, thus preventing you from seeing the robots at the origin of some rather treacherous missiles to avoid. Also some textures are of slightly lower quality and the aappearance of the characters is more plasticky. Thanks to a ~block~ hair management, some enemies, Coco's bear and Crash himself thus appear less realistic and, in some ways, more similar to their original counterparts. A similar argument also applies to the portable version. Here too, the 720p target supported by the Switch screen seems far away, with an image generally less sharp than it appears on similar productions. However, the rendering of the color palette is good, as are the performances: the framerate remains in fact generally anchored to 30 frames per second, with slight drops, and irrelevant for the overall experience, only during some cutscenes and in particularly frenzy of the levels. Finally, we have to deal with the controls, the cross and delight of each analysis of games for Switch. Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy obviously supports both Joy-Con and the Pro Controller, taking advantage of the HD Rumble to offer a more precise and immersive vibration system when collecting Wumpa fruits or being hit by an enemy. The annoying limit remains in the race of the left analog of the Joy-Con which, together with the absence of a traditional d-pad, requires a little extra practice especially to face the millimeter jumps of the first Crash Bandicoot.", "date": "2018-07-01", "grade": "9.0"}
