{"name": "Midnight Club: Los Angeles - South Central - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-club-los-angeles-south-central-recensione.html", "text": "The new chapter of the famous Rockstar brand dedicated to the world of road racing represents an excellent multi-faceted video game for the genre, which can boast an enviable range of situations and races, albeit with a non-revolutionary gameplay and structure. The new portion of the map called South Central can be downloaded for free from the Xbox Live marketplace, but in order to take advantage of the unpublished competitions, additional vehicles and soundtrack created specifically for the occasion, it is necessary to spend 800 Microsoft Points. This expansion does not revolutionize the main game and does not add new ways of tackling the missions: it is basically a very full-bodied data pack that gives depth and vastness to the original, albeit large and rich Los Angeles. Pimp my Car on the crowded streets of L.A.! The latest Midnight Club update is split into two separate download files. The first, free, exclusively concerns the South Central map which adds an extra district to the base game, almost 1/3 of the size of the original map. This first download, dedicated to everyone, has the exclusive function of giving all those who have enjoyed the latest Rockstar effort a substantial portion to explore and visit freely. The real update, however, is contained in the second download called ~Premium~ which, in addition to containing the aforementioned additional map of South Central, brings with it a whole series of new vehicles, lots of competitions and an unpublished soundtrack at a cost of 800 MP (9 .90 Euros for the Playstation 3 version). There are 9 new cars and they include vintage and modern cars such as the very powerful Mercedes-Benz CLK63 AMG ~Black~. The cars of past years are instead the Chevy Bel Air, Buick Riviera, Chevy Malibu and Chevy Impala (true status symbol of the Californian west coast), released on the market between the 50s and 60s. About ten years later are the Chevy Chevelle and the famous Pontiac GTO, both typically American-style muscle cars. However, the Premium Pack also adds a whole new category, that of SUVs, with the Range Rover Sport Supercharged and its basic version. New competitions, races, circuits and much more! The dish is rich, even if it has the same taste as the base game. South Central does not distort the gameplay of Los Angeles, does not bring changes, new modes or new ways to manage your car. South Central is a very full-bodied more of the same dedicated to those who have devoured this last Midnight Club and still want to run and compete: almost 150 new events have been added to participate in, divided into various categories. First of all, there are almost a hundred ~traffic light~ competitions: those familiar with the game know that most of the challenges start right at the traffic light intersections of the streets and end up elsewhere on the map. The player is free to choose the path he prefers, without a pre-calculated or standard route: the important thing is to arrive before the others and beat them in time. The spirit of the game is in fact to explore the city, find new alleys, discover shortcuts to win and become master of all the streets and of Los Angeles, beautifully freely recreated by Rockstar in every detail. Added to this type of race are 10 delivery missions and 26 track races, as well as new content dedicated to the single player career (and related objectives and trophies to unlock for the occasion). The new portion of the map is very substantial and extends right next to the original one for about 1/3 of its size. The care placed in the technical realization is the same: many details, many animated elements such as people and cars, realistic light sources and excellent, varied and well-defined textures. The look shown by South Central is splendid and very similar to the real counterpart of the City of Angels, which in its digital version appears alive and frenetic. Extras and audio tracks The Premium Pack also offers contents from an aesthetic and performance point of view, with new vinyls, new kits and pieces to be used on your racing car, which are added to the pre-existing ones and definitely increase the range of choices available to all maniacs of the tuning. The download package not only contains the new map, roads, events, races, cars and parts, but also includes a good audio update with 9 new tracks (contained in an EP intended for sale, by the way) of which 2 are specially created for this expansion. One of them, Switchin Lanes, is by Kid Cudi, who recently hit the dance floor with his hit single ~Day'n Night~. The Midnight Club expansion also comes a short distance from the update: the recentnt patch has adjusted the level of difficulty, recalibrated the artificial intelligence of opponents controlled by the CPU, polishing some imperfections of the career and many bugs reported by users. Comment For those who have loved this latest chapter of Midnight Club, the download of the Premium add-on pack is strongly recommended. For all those who instead enjoyed the Rockstar title but soon got bored of the gameplay, we remind you that South Central does not offer any new modes or a reworking of that gameplay: we therefore recommend that this category of gamers download the free package which contains only the additional map.Pro The additional area The new cars Bind Against Nothing new compared to the basic structure", "date": "2009-04-16", "grade": null}
