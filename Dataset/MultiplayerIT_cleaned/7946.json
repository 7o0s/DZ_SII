We remind you that the package can be purchased both separately, with each episode at the price of 800 Microsoft Points or 9.99, or in a single solution thanks to the Season Pass of 2400 Microsoft Points or 29.99. As already anticipated in the previous review, the plot of the downloadable content is configured without hesitation as a fake history, bringing Connor back in time to when he had recently conquered the Assassin's robes, and contrasting him with George Washington, intent on dominating the United States by crowning himself Re. Although the developers have promised that all the details necessary to reconstruct what exactly happened will be provided, and because Connor seems to remember some fragments of the original plot as if he had actually lived them, even in this second chapter there is no trace of explanations that justify the mysterious time loop, which will probably be reserved for the third and final episode, which will finally see the two confront each other in the gigantic pyramid built by King George Washington in New York. After a first chapter dedicated mainly to the lands of the Frontier, The Betrayal brings players back to Boston, for the occasion by providing Connor with a new supernatural power, excellent for moving at great speed. After all, what's the point of being silent or invisible, when no guard can ever reach you? Eagle wings Tracing the structure of Infamia, Il Tradimento offers a beginning characterized by mechanics closer to the classic ones of the brand, instructing the player to escape from a prison crowded with guards. The sequence is quite short but interesting for the level design and of course getting caught in the process will draw far more opponents to the spot. Once the incipit is completed, we will quickly move on to the conquest of the new power, which will join the one already available to Connor in The Infamy. In fact, where the previous chapter had given Ratonhnhak:ton the power to become temporarily invisible, and on occasion to call three ghost-wolves to himself, with The Betrayal the developers propose a power linked to mobility, appropriately shifting the action from the woods of the Border to the crowded streets of Boston. Aware of having a superhuman task ahead of him, namely to overthrow the dictatorship imposed by Washington on his own, Connor has no choice but to turn again to the supernatural knowledge of his tribe, and complete a new ritual at the sacred tree. Once again we will find ourselves lost among the rough architectures of the Animus, this time in charge of defending eagle nests from external attacks, climbing the branches of the tree and protecting the endangered eggs. Once this short sequence is completed, you will return to the outside world, enriched by a new power, that of the Eagle. The latter is configured as an ability mainly linked to movement, following solutions already seen in other free-exploration games (see Batman: Arkham City). In fact, during the exploration of the city setting, a new superimposed dynamic cursor will be added to the traditional interface, which will indicate all the possible arrival and connection points in sight. By pressing the button dedicated to the new power, Connor will instantly transform into a ghost eagle and will reach his destination in a flutter of wings. Although already used in a basic way, the power offers a clear incentive to mobility, soon the possibility of chaining the animation will be discovered, moving with even greater speed and without ever stopping. During the flight it will in fact be possible to look around freely, and quickly select a new arrival point, press the dedicated button again and therefore change direction ~on the run~. Given the almost inexhaustible availability of attachment points between the streets of Boston, the power of the Eagle proved to be very fun to use, and, once again, capable of significantly changing the approach to the classic gameplay offered by the series. Xbox 360 goals The Betrayal offers 3 achievements for a combined total of 75 Gamerscore points, tied to getting max sync and traveling a certain distance in eagle form without breaking the flow. Rebellion Although the Eagle's power does not encompass two completely different uses like that of the wolf pack, the supernatural ability can also be used in combat. Indeed takingtargeting opponents, instead of simply moving towards the destination in bird form, Connor will close the animation by eliminating up to two, returning to physical form just before landing and stabbing them with the double hidden blade. The power of the Eagle is therefore configured as very versatile, as it can be used both to move very quickly from one point to another on the map, and as a useful tool for combat and, on the contrary, to quickly escape from an unwanted skirmish , and lose track in a few moments. The missions offered by this second chapter naturally put themselves at the service of skill, proposing rapid crossings of the city and a long sequence at the port, where you will find yourself moving from one ship to another. Used in conjunction with the power offered by the previous DLC, the Eagle grants fights against exceptionally large groups of opponents. In fact, the last phase of the DLC will see Connor oppose a large number of guards on the docks of the port, who will present themselves in regular waves and must be defeated quickly, before their number becomes excessive. Unlike the balancing carried out in the previous chapter, thanks to which the developers had managed to keep the challenge level in the average of the saga, with this second episode Connor's powers interfere too much with the difficulty of the fights, as running away following a Identification proves to be very simple, and mobility proves to be decisive even in combat, especially when used in combination with the three ghost wolves. Shorter than the previous one, this second chapter seemed to us overall not packaged with the same care, characterized by several filler moments despite the limited duration, fewer secondary assignments and above all few novelties from the point of view of the plot, which remains rather static awaiting the obvious final confrontation. A pity, considering that the departure of this episodic DLC had clearly convinced us. Therefore, to deserve advice on buying, the package will definitely have to recover with the third episode, which we will review in a month's time, and from which we expect an epilogue packaged with the same quality as the incipit, and, obviously, a new power more balanced and adequately contextualised. If we were to evaluate this chapter as a stand-alone, the purchase advice would be negative, and limited only to completionists and fanatics of the saga. Given that it fits into a larger context, which the predecessor has instead clearly convinced us, and that those who are interested in playing The Tyranny of King Washington cannot avoid buying all three chapters to understand the plot, we we limit ourselves to classifying it as a less successful episode, and we hope to be able to reconfirm a positive evaluation with the third and last episode.", "date": "2013-03-19", "grade": null}
