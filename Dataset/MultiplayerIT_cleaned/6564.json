{"name": "Disastro zombi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/145221-zombeer-disastro-zombi.html", "text": "In every group there is always a friend who tries to be nice by copying the jokes of the others, or repeating them like catchphrases until someone points out that more than funny, his voice sounds pathetic. It's the one who spends the hours of the day repeating phrases from the movies, hoping to make you laugh; what you would like to choke because it proves to be appropriate on every occasion like intestinal colic at a nudist party. Zombeer is the gaming equivalent of the aforementioned friend. The idea of making a parody of zombie video games isn't even a bad thing, only that in this case we are faced with a poorly made work that at best manages to parody itself. So we have the zombie epidemic spreading around the world and a student of an American university who has to save his wife from a zombifying rector. The title of the game comes from the only known antidote to the ultimate transformation: drinking beer. More precisely, drinking Zombeer, but in modest quantities because doing it in excess would have the completely opposite effect to the desired one, accelerating the mutation. This sort of plot translates into one of the most annoying game mechanics ever experienced in living memory, which not only requires you to go around constantly collecting bottles of beer, but also to drink them complete with a dedicated few seconds animation . But do we want to add annoyance to annoyance? The zombification gauge depletes at a staggering rate, to the point where you find yourself drinking beer every fifteen seconds to top it up. A real playful nightmare that tires after a few minutes, delivering the mind to a deep sense of frustration, due to the pounding wondering why the inclusion of such a destructive mechanism for the gonads, that it is not clear how it managed to pass a any playtest, even an internal one conducted by the developers. What did they find beautiful in it? Of dildos and other bad jokes If the beer-gulping mechanic wasn't enough to decree Zombeer a disaster, the rest of the game also arrives to support our preliminary judgment. But let's go in order and go back to the plague friend described at the beginning of the previous paragraph. As a parody Zombeer should at least try to be funny, reworking playful and narrative forms of other titles to exploit them in a context deformed by the comic skills of its authors. Unfortunately we are facing a complete failure also from this point of view. Let's take for example the first weapon: the dildo used as a club. Ok, in Saints' Row he was funny and brought a smile. It also did well in the Shadow Warrior reboot, where it stood out for the contrast it created with the rest of the game. Why doesn't it work here? For the principle that we have attempted to expound above. Comedy has its times and its forms, i.e. its own language that must be respected to produce the desired effect. The appearance of the dildo in Zombeer has the typical stench of the old joke told by those who don't know how to do it: the story is there, it's the same as the one told by the great comedian, but it completely lacks intonation and the timing is all wrong. If you want we can enumerate the large number of recycled and unsuccessful gags present in the game, such as the zombies that become tombstones, or the swimming zombie, but be content to know that we are below the level of a cinematographer, or any b- movie, and that there really isn't anything funny, with jokes that make us regret the sheep films with Pippo Franco and Gianfranco d'Angelo. Do yourself harm by reading our review of Zombeer, a bad game among bad games Shoot me here! But at least the game is there? It's nice? It is funny? Part? You may be wondering in the throes of muscle spasms. We've covered the terrifying beer mechanic already, but luckily Zombeer has plenty of other bad mechanics to show off, as well as a slew of bugs. For example, three quarters of the game, which fortunately lasts a couple of hours, are spent with terrifying weapons that you don't quite understand what they shoot. The typical scene sees a zombie attacking us, us firing bursts without the shots slowing it down or producing any kind of feedback (it's not even clear which ones hit and which ones miss), so the sympathetic doesn't - dead ends up on the ground suddenly becoming a tombstone with his name written on it. The first two weapons, excluding the dildo, use the same projectiles and seem to differ only in the damage caused. The fourth and final weapon, a kind of shotgun, slightly changes the cards on the table, but is used for a very short time and, above all, does not produce any feedback when shots are fired.they hit. So you can shoot point-blank at an enemy who is attacking you and you won't see him retreat a step. Beautiful, is not it? Don't worry, this was just the awful part of Zombeer. Now comes the catastrophic part. For example, in one of the early stages of the game it is necessary to cross the turbine of a plane that fell on the school. To do this you have to put a zombie into it to block it, then pass. Why try so hard when you can traverse the scenery? Come on, just exploit the right bug and you're done. It's true that distinguishing game bugs in this case is difficult, but with an effort of imagination you can do it without problems. Another masterpiece of contemporary art are the interactive filmed events, or QTE for friends, completely free and out of place, which in case of failure kill on the spot forcing you to reload the game. One would like them to be introduced in some way, instead they suddenly arrive mid-game in completely useless situations (at least they were spectacular... not even that). Speaking of spectacularity: it's been years since we've seen ugly graphics like Zombeer's. We don't call it ugly just because it's badly done, but because it lacks a minimum of taste (ask for style seems too much to us), with criminal complaint animations and zombie models that came out of the scraps of a failed production. Fortunately there is the terrible soundtrack to cheer us up and to remind us that you can always do worse than you think.", "date": "2015-02-17", "grade": "2.0"}
