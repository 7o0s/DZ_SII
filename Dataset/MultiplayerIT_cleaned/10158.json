The offer is revealed in a battle between our troops and those controlled by the AI, a clash that is consumed with blows of upgrades, numbers, quick strategic considerations and a pinch of luck. With the arrival of the excellent Plants vs Zombies on the App Store, which had already gained a considerable following on PC, we thought we'd seen it all. Well, Battle of Puppets denies us without too many problems thanks to the uniqueness of its graphic sector, in which hordes of puppets are the absolute protagonists of the action and move on a sort of theatrical stage, complete with scenographic elements that alternate to change the landscape depending on the situation. The game offers three different modes: ~conquest~, ~siege~ and ~quick conquest~. In the first, our goal is simply to defeat the enemy, overcoming his troops to destroy his base; the second is a sort of ~survival~ in which we must try to resist as much as possible the onslaught of different waves of hostile puppets; the third is a variant of the first, but with a time limit to respect. The puppet theatre There are twenty-two stages scattered across the map, and each has a different ~theme~ based on the area in which it is located: in Las Vegas we will be able to appreciate a background full of luminous signs and puppets dressed as ancient Egyptians, for example, while in Santa Fe the scenario will be made up of anonymous Mexican musicians, cacti and churches. The gameplay develops horizontally, with a sort of ~radar~ placed at the bottom of the screen which indicates the position of our units and those of the enemy, as well as the various ~checkpoints~ which, once passed, are acquired by one of the two factions and reinforced so as to constitute an additional barrier to be broken down to reach the base, the destruction of which is a necessary and sufficient condition for completing the level. It is from the base that our puppets start, through a series of really immediate and intuitive gestures: we touch the stakeout and an interface appears with the icons relating to the puppets that we can build at the moment, so we can set up the units we want ( limited to a certain number, however) using the money already available as well as what we will earn from eliminating enemies. The newly created puppets will make their way towards the enemy base and automatically battle anyone who stands between them and the target. The starting units consist of a puppet armed with a sword, which therefore can only face close combat, and one capable of throwing projectiles and therefore striking from a distance. As resources permit, the base can be upgraded to become not only more durable, but also capable of producing new units, including horsemen and wheeled cannons. In addition to the automatic skills of the puppets, there are special powers that we can use when the appropriate bar (located in the center of the screen, top) is full, and which in various ways can give us a few moments of advantage over our opponents. To complete the stages, therefore, it is necessary to plan the production of the puppets well, immediately take advantage of the upgrades and therefore try to overwhelm the enemy thanks to the use of advanced units, possibly in conditions of numerical superiority. As already underlined, the technical sector of Battle of Puppets is striking for the originality of some solutions and for the quality of the whole. The puppets are ~dressed~ differently depending on the scenario, have good quality animations and an excellent design. The background is full of moving elements, with an alternation of light and dark and an extraordinary use of colors. The ~strings~ that pull the defeated puppets up are a touch of class, while a nice music box accompanies the clashes.
