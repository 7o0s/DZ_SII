{"name": "Moto perpetuo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/161459-traffic-rider-moto-perpetuo.html", "text": "Behind the skgames brand there is actually a single developer named Soner Kara, who in 2012 successfully debuted on the App Store thanks to his Traffic Racer, an endless runner based on cars in which the user had to travel as many kilometers of highway avoiding traffic. After the aeronaval parenthesis of Wings of Fire, the good Soner Kara now returns to the formula of his first game with the present Traffic Rider, replacing the cars with motorcycles, adopting an unprecedented first person view and enriching the playful offer with a single player campaign proper. Will it be enough to repeat the fortunes of the beginnings? New vehicle, same traffic In a period in which endless runners often tend to limit themselves to homework, Traffic Rider denotes an enviable attention to detail, especially considering that it is the work of a single person. From the main menu, you can access the different game modes that are unlocked as you accumulate experience and level up: the lion's share goes to a career made up of more than 40 missions, but the sections never end, time trial and free driving help to compose a respectable package that develops along four settings also available in three distinct time slots. The juice of the playful experience falls within the canons of what has already been seen in the previous Traffic Racer and more generally in the standard of free to play products, with the user accumulating virtual money in each game necessary to upgrade his current motorcycle or to buy one new among the 20 models available, but unlike (too many) similar titles, the latest addition to the skgames house is good at avoiding putting your hands in the pockets of the consumer on the move. The main source of income of the application is in fact in the advertising messages that occasionally appear on the screen (which can still be removed by paying a small sum), while substantially all the in-app purchases present are to be considered optional and aimed at those who want to unlock certain content without having to go through the inevitable grind. A practice that in many games tends to be particularly boring, but which in Traffic Rider becomes sustainable thanks to the good qualities of the gameplay. Traffic Rider puts quality and content on the plate without giving in to excessive in-app purchases First person runner Framed from a first-person view of great effect and capable of guaranteeing an excellent sensation of speed, Traffic Rider makes use of a simple but precise and reliable control system: two virtual keys placed on the sides of the screen in correspondence with the handlebar grips allow you to accelerate and brake, while changing direction by tilting the device. Although you always run along infinite straight lines, the game does not lack elements capable of always keeping the user's attention alive, above all thanks to a successful mechanism of risks and rewards that underlies the gameplay: driving recklessly at high speed , going the wrong way, overtaking cars and performing ~tamarrissime~ wheelies are all activities that are rewarded with an extra score, but which at the same time can lead to disastrous accidents with consequent loss of precious seconds. Immediate and fun as is mandatory for any self-respecting endless runner, Traffic Rider undoubtedly gives positive sensations also as regards the technical realization: the motorcycle models are very well made, and each one is characterized by a dashboard defined down to the smallest detail that makes her look good with the subjective camera. Even the sound defends itself with honor, putting convincing effects on the plate especially as regards the roar of the different engines.", "date": "2016-01-04", "grade": "8.3"}
