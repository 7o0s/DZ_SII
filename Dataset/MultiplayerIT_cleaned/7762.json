Nadeo's reasons appear very valid, especially if we consider the price of TrackMania 2: Stadium, and therefore there are good chances that the renewal operation will go through, or rather that the many TrackMania Nations fans will abandon the now ancient episode for embrace a modernity made up of many little things, not only related to the technical sector. But let's go in order. We tried the game during the beta phase and it aroused good sensations in us, proposing the ones that have always been the strengths of the series, i.e. a gameplay that is incredibly simple and immediate on the one hand, and frenetic and challenging on the other, where the requirements to unlock the next level imply perfect knowledge of the track, its curves, the points where you can go full throttle and those where you have to let go of the pedal, the spectacular jumps and the fearsome loop-the-loops. The progression is evident during the single player campaign, divided into ~tournaments~ of different colors that gradually raise the bar and ask us to first obtain bronze, then silver and finally gold medals in order to continue in the our climb to success. And the key is all there: in the hairpin you faced on the verge of colliding with a barrier, in the jump with the car perfectly aligned with the track, in the trajectory that allows you to eat a couple of tenths more before crossing the finish line. In short, TrackMania. TrackMania 2: Stadium puts great elements on the plate together with a popular price The important thing is to push The action of TrackMania 2: Stadium is basic but terribly solid. Whether you play with the controller or the keyboard, the result doesn't change, the involvement is the same and the tracks, the real protagonists of the Nadeo production, know how to give great emotions. The developers played with hairpin bends, bumps, ramps and three different types of surfaces: classic asphalt, which guarantees grip and speed; the dirt road, very fun thanks to drift driving; grass, a sometimes unpredictable variant. These solutions alternate gradually during the single player campaign, which gradually becomes more complex and continues to test us, now presenting us with a track with sections that are difficult to interpret, now a jump to be made at the right speed on pain of crashing. It's all damn ~old school~: you throw yourself on the track and get familiar with the pitfalls they have prepared for us, with the possibility of resetting the ~stint~ at any time thanks to the push of a button, starting again from a few meters before of an error or from scratch. In some sections, the car can even ~turn off~ and you have to proceed by inertia for a few moments, while crossing the fearsome loops of the loop automatically translates into the transition to the first person view. And we fall? We would also experience that feeling as protagonists. In short, Nadeo's boys have actually indulged themselves with the experiments, after all the legacy of the original Stadium is not easy to bear and it is therefore clear that extra efforts were needed. The powerful integrated editor should be seen in the same context, which allows us to create the track of our dreams or a real ~trap~ in which to attract unsuspecting users. From this point of view, things have not changed compared to our previous test: the potential is all there and the interface is quite simple, but in some situations the tools should be improved. Lights and shadows Played alone, TrackMania 2: Stadium can last a handful of hours or much more, depending on your skill and experience with the mechanics of the series, which are basically always the same. As mentioned, an excellent job has been done in terms of progression and the only limit of the campaign is perhaps the lack of a minimally articulated structure, a defect that is magnified by a graphical interface that really didn't convince us and which we would almost define ~amateur~. In any case, putting aside the solitary challenges, it is possible to deal with the online sector and its inevitable surprises. One of these is quite bitter: during the beta it seemed to us that the users and their servers were much more numerous, but we could be wrong or maybe we have caught ~slack~ days. In any case, there is no shortage of choice, and it only takes a few seconds to select a pre-existing game or create a custom one. Once on the track, it very often collides with archesliterally sick structures, for example a race that begins with a tight hairpin bend and which perhaps, after a few meters, forces us to make jumps that are possible only with an adequate run-up. There are still quite a number of phenomena due to lag, with cars disappearing or flashing conspicuously on the screen. As usual, being part of a large company of enthusiasts can protect us from any inconvenience and give us fun-filled evenings, so it is a factor to be taken into due consideration. So let's come to the technical realization and let's start immediately by saying that the wonders seen in TrackMania 2: Canyon are something else compared to Stadium, much simpler and ~bare~, therefore less impressive in terms of visual impact. Let's be clear: the steps forward compared to the 2006 episode are substantial and can all be seen, the fluidity is high even on non-top configurations and it was played in an interesting way with lights and shadows, also in support of the gameplay, but the result final is simply the norm compared to what PC owners are now accustomed to in the arena of driving games.", "date": "2013-07-02", "grade": "8.0"}
