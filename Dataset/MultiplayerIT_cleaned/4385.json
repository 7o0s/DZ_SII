Making a sequel to such a spot-on product, in terms of ways and times, is almost always a risk destined to translate into a final result with a lower impact, if not downright disappointment. Alto's Odyssey still tries the feat, in the developer's belief that he may still have something new to say to improve the final recipe. Snowboarding without snow In reality, improving Alto's Adventure is not a simple undertaking: within the insurmountable limits of a genre that by its very nature is based on repetitiveness, the title of Snowman was in fact a distillation of harmony, measure and elegance without obvious critical issues. For this reason, Odyssey seems at first sight almost a more of the same, not to mention even a reskin of the original: where three years ago it was about descending from the top of a snowy mountain with a snowboard at your feet, in this case instead the setting is positioned at the opposite proposing a hot desert. Going from the snow to the sand, the result does not change, even if the cold blanket of snow no longer passes under the table but the soft dunes: the goal is essentially that of any endless runner, that is to get as far as possible without running into one of the obstacles which can lead to game over. Along the descent, the only interaction with your character is linked to pressing the screen, which translates into a jump: by continuing to hold your finger down, you begin to perform a backflip, or a somersault backwards, which is the only trick that can be performed in the game. Chaining jumps, collecting objects, grinding on ropes, breaking rocks and so on are all actions that are rewarded with points, which contribute to the final tally. At the same time, collecting coins allows you to access the shop to buy (only with virtual currency, since there are no in-app purchases in Alto's Odyssey) objects or modifiers capable of making the descent easier. Up to this point, with the exception of the setting, it is the exact same description of the predecessor: the substantial difference that justifies this new episode is mainly linked to the possibility of using one's table also to run on rocky walls, so as to use them as a sort of ramp to overcome dangerous passages or - above all - to favor the execution of trick combinations. This novelty integrates perfectly into the mechanics to the point of appearing natural, if not almost obvious and obvious: in practice, however, the possibility of running on walls enriches the gameplay by giving greater verticality and making the action more full-bodied and rich without but become more complex or complicated. A rich desert Even the aesthetic component, fundamental in the definition of the first chapter, has undergone an improvement while remaining faithful to the debut: the person responsible for this element is in fact once again the English artist Harry Nesbitt, who has taken up the same minimal and stylized style, however applying it to a much more elaborate, varied and complex desert setting. In fact, during the descent you will come across different landscapes, each immediately recognizable, with distinctive elements that reverberate their own function even in the game itself: for example the vineyards can be grinded like ropes, but being more fragile they tend to break after a bit'. Or the watercourses, which accompany and accelerate the descent of the protagonist, also guaranteeing a sort of momentum in the air once he reaches the small lake downstream, respecting Archimedes' principle. Or hot air balloons, which act as trampolines giving a bounce when you pass over them. The scenarios, already very evocative, are enormously enriched as the day goes by and in the different light conditions that this determines: starting a game with the first light of dawn and then continuing it by observing the panorama turn into the bright red of the sunset or the purple of the night is a real pleasure for the eyes, which can be crystallized by the new photographic mode through which to take images to keep on your device (and perhaps to use as wallpaper) or to share. Also new is the Zen mode, which practically eliminates both the deaths and the score, allowing you to face the descent in relaxation, focusing on the pure pleasure of discovery.", "date": "2018-02-28", "grade": "8.8"}
