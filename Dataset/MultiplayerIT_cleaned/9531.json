{"name": "The Sly Trilogy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83627-sly-collection-il-signore-dei-tranelli.html", "text": "It was 2004 when Multiplayer.it entrusted me with the review of Sly 2: Banda di Ladri, a little jewel in the varied PlayStation 2 toy library which confirmed the ability of the developer Sucker Punch, who had been able to reinvent himself starting from a great prequel. Today, six years later, The Sly Trilogy has aroused intense reflection, during its pirouettes in the new Sony console: it has demonstrated once again how a good game is timeless and, unlike people, ages very differently and singular. The Sly Trilogy is also the most exemplary proof of the evolution of a video game and of the influence that the market can have on the franchise, in short, something to be studied for those interested in this aspect of the video game market. From a practical point of view, however, it is a damn fun game. A raccoon in 2011 What probably interests the reader, potential buyer of this trilogy contained in a single blu-ray disc, is the quality of the porting and the real extent of the graphic improvements made to the three games. We are pleased to confirm the goodness of the visual revamp, which greatly enhances the already very high content quality of the entire trilogy. Strengthened by its new 720p resolution and a careful general rejuvenation operation, which also benefited the rock-solid frame-rate, The Sly Trilogy succeeds in the difficult task of looking almost like a game developed now for the PlayStation 3, so much is the final graphic rendering is defined, fluid and clean. Also thanks to the excellent three-dimensional engine of Sucker Punch and the cartoonish cel-shading style which already at the time of the original release had proved to be a winning choice, each game contained in the disc is visually fresh and pleasant, with very few elements to betray its reality age. Owners of 3D televisions will also be able to play some of the five mini-games made specifically for the trilogy in three dimensions: this feature is actually rather superficial and adds nothing to the excellent package, but in case it is possible to take advantage of it, Sanzaru Games and Sucker Punch they thought this too. Who knows maybe it's not an experiment for the upcoming Sly 4? Playstation 3 trophies Keen collectors of Trophies will find in The Sly Trilogy a real bonanza: not only does each of the three episodes have a very personal list of Bronze, Silver and Platinum Trophies, but there are also Trophies for the mini-games and, even better, not it is not at all difficult or frustrating to get hold of the three Platinums. Dulcis in fundo, this milestone also unlocks a teaser-trailer for the future Sly 4. The Fantastic Three It would be difficult to summarize the history of the entire trilogy in a single paragraph, so we will limit ourselves to a brief description, leaving the players the pleasure of discovering the evolution of the saga by themselves, from episode to episode. The protagonist is always Sly Cooper, a thief as skilled as he is fascinating, who in the very first chapter, Sly Cooper & the Thievous Raccoonus, will find himself having to recover the pages of an ancient manuscript that has belonged to his family for generations. At his side are his cronies Bentley and Murray and on the other side Carmelita Fox, a sexy policewoman with whom Sly just can't stop flirting. The first Sly is a real starter to what awaits the player in the sequels, but in Sly's movements and abilities the most attentive will already recognize a shadow of what Sucker Punch would have proposed, years later, in the most recent and famous inFamous. Sly 2: Band of Thieves is perhaps the spearhead of the entire trilogy, if only because at that point the franchise takes on its own identity, abandoning the linearity of the prequel in favor of the greater freedom of exploration granted by the ~hubs~ to from which the game levels unfold in the form of missions. It is also the first episode of the series in which it is also possible to play as Sly's companions, a feature that certainly adds variety to the gameplay, despite the missions as Bentley or Murray being a bit subdued compared to those in the role of protagonist, even if it is just a matter of mere individual preference. Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves, and we are already in 2005, is the least surprising moment of the trilogy as it adds little new to the excellent formula experimented in the prequel, however it is also the episode with the most refined and elaborate stages and bosses , a worthy (temporary!) conclusion to the adventures of the three irresistible scoundrels. The variety of situations, the optimally calibrated difficulty of the levels and the generous quantity of secrets to discover lead the playtime of each episode to exceed about ten hours: the trilogy therefore does not betray eitheron longevity, enhanced more by the many Trophies than by the easily forgettable unpublished mini-games.", "date": "2011-01-10", "grade": "9.0"}
