{"name": "Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fist-of-the-north-star-lost-paradise-recensione.html", "text": "Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise represents the union of two extremely fascinating universes: on the one hand the saga of Hokuto no Ken, the manga created by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara which is celebrating its thirty-five years in this period and which boasts many fans also in Italy, where it landed with the anime entitled Ken the warrior; on the other hand, the Yakuza franchise, one of the most successful SEGA productions in Japan, the protagonist of a substantial relaunch in recent times also in the West. When Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced this new project, we were really excited: the team's talent is well known and it therefore seemed that the legendary successor of the Divine School of Hokuto could finally aspire to a quality tie-in on PlayStation 4. after the discrete musou released on the previous generation platforms. That's exactly what happened, let's see why with our review of Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise. Story and setting: a new Ken Those who have played with the various episodes of Yakuza know well how much the series created by Toshihiro Nagoshi is linked to their settings, in particular the fictitious district of Kamurocho, in Tokyo: a scenario that the development team has refined and enriched over the course of the years, arriving with the last chapters to perfectly render the places and atmospheres. For the creation of Fist of the North star: Lost Paradise we therefore thought of a reinterpretation of the classic plot, to be transposed together with its protagonists within a city, Eden. It is a legendary place, which rises in the middle of the desert lands that characterize the post-apocalyptic scenario of Hokuto no Ken, and which only a privileged few can enter. In fact, within those walls we find ourselves living as before the war, with a current currency and commercial activities in which to spend it: stalls, shops, bars and even casinos. Of course, there are some concessions to barbarism, see the arena in which convicts collide determined to have any wish granted by Princess Xsana; but public order is guaranteed by a police force that does not go lightly with those who commit crimes, led by the cunning Captain Jagre. How does Ken get to such a place? After the clash with Shin to free Julia (or Yuria, as they have transliterated in the game), the master of Hokuto discovers that his fiance was brought dying right in the city of Eden, and it is therefore there that he will have to look for her . The only way to enter without a visa, however, is to get arrested and then try your luck in the arena, facing hardened criminals and finally the enormous son of the devil. An impossible challenge for anyone, but we're still talking about Kenshiro. Combat system and moves Obtaining citizen status, Ken gains the trust of the princess and Captain Jagre just in time to witness a violent attack launched on the gates of Eden, which are destroyed. The breach, caused by the troops of the mysterious general Kyo-Oh, quickly transforms the city into a dangerous area, to which everyone can enter, even and above all the bad guys. In this way, from a narrative point of view, even if not immediately, the presence of thugs on the streets that we will have to face, in pure Yakuza style, when we come into contact with them, is justified. The controls and combat system are basically the same as we've come to know from Kazuma Kiryu's adventures, albeit with an emphasis on Hokuto's deadly techniques, which can be performed via quick time events after putting enemies into a daze. Witnessing iconic maneuvers such as the blow of the pressure to the temples and then the explosion of the opponents is clearly exhilarating for those who grew up on bread and Ken the warrior, and it must be said that from this point of view the game does an excellent job, reproducing the most devastating moves in the protagonist's repertoire. However, performing them in a mandatory way becomes a rather repetitive practice after a while, therefore we tend to avoid that type of solution in favor of faster finishers (with the pressure of the Circle key at the right time after a trigger) or traditional combos. The combat system works, but is very limited during the first hours of the campaign, starting to acquire a minimum of variety only after the release of a few extra moves, obtainable with the use of the orbs conquered with each victory from the upgrades screen. It therefore happens that we very often resort to a flurry of punches and some basic combinations to quickly get rid of the less courageous opponentscei, and then focus on the bigger and more resistant ones. After a certain amount of kills we will see the seven stars indicator fill up and we will be able to enter ~fury~ mode by pressing the R2 backbone: Ken will disintegrate his jacket, surrounded by a red aura, and his shots will acquire a considerably higher power for a certain period of time. The last peculiarity of the combat system are the talismans, which can be purchased and upgraded at a specific shop in Eden and then assigned to the directions of the d-pad, with the possibility of equipping different sets at the same time. These are specials each linked to a historical supporting actor, which allow you to increase power, defense or spiritual energy, or even to deliver a powerful automatic blow at the enemy's address. Enemies and side missions The various mechanisms that characterize the gameplay and the combat system of Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise are exploited to the fullest during the boss fights, when Ken is faced with some of his greatest opponents, such as Souther, Raul, Jagi, the aforementioned Shin and Rei. The duels revolve around patterns to memorize, evasive actions and parries to be carried out at the right time, trying to slowly gnaw at the enemy's health bar and activate a quick time event that takes us to the next phase of the fight. Naturally, engaging in these fights without having first replenished the food supplies, useful for a sudden restoration of energy, would be a serious mistake, given that the blows of the opponents can quickly lead us to game over. The narrative placement of the bosses has been adapted to the new context, but this inevitably creates a great distance from the events of the original series, losing in charm and capacity for involvement. How to compare the true saga of Souther, with the sacrifice of Shu at the end of his personal via crucis, to the simple attack of the holy emperor on the city of Eden? But examples abound. We must therefore make the effort to understand how Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise actually wants to pay homage to Hokuto no Ken and its incredible characters without however faithfully replicating their deeds, rather trying to offer even old fans a story to largely unedited, with various forcings and weaknesses but also some interesting high notes. The same goes for the secondary missions and for some easter eggs (see the huge henchman dressed as a woman in the main bar of Eden), which make fun of some aspects of the work of Buronson and Hara (the shoulder pad fetishist ? Seriously?) but they substantially enrich a structure capable of guaranteeing over thirty hours of play if you decide to do everything and not go straight on. Exploration and side activities The spin-off nature of Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise is expressed above all in the game structure, which also incorporates the dynamics of the Yakuza series. In fact, among the streets of Eden we will find shops where you can buy food and objects, but above all places of entertainment where you can try your hand at nice mini-games. The Divine School of Hokuto has surprisingly effective techniques for the treatment of ailments, and this factor is exploited in a mini-game in which Ken improvises as a doctor, curing hordes of patients to the rhythm of music... or almost. The precision and power of this martial art prove to be perfect for creating extraordinary cocktails, as we will discover working in a city bar, but there will also be the opportunity to manage a cabaret club with the exact same rules of the recently seen minigame in Yakuza Kiwami 2, or try your luck at the casino tables. After the very first stages of the campaign we will be able to board a buggy and go around the lands surrounding the main setting, collecting materials and reaching other destinations, such as a baseball field where you can train your swing in a decidedly particular way . Also around Eden we will be able to find old cabinets to be restored and placed in the city's arcade, so as to be able to play a few games with Space Harrier, Out Run, Super Hang-On, the inevitable UFO catchers and even the Fist of the North cartridge Star for SEGA Master System. The side activities represent a pleasant pastime between one mission and another, but it is clear that Yakuza fans could find them largely already seen. Playstation 4 trophies There are 59 Trophies obtainable by playing Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise on PS4. Some of them are related to the simple completion of the prologue and the eleven chapters that make up the campaigngna, but most of the achievements revolve around peculiar actions, often based on numbers: the exchange of one hundred objects, the use of all Hokuto's techniques, the unlocking of fifty skills, the completion of all minigames and so on . Graphics and sound Kenshiro's design in Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise is that of the later volumes of the manga, featuring very long legs and a pair of shoulder pads. Some sequences underline the extreme resemblance of the polygonal model to the paper counterpart, and apart from some slightly bizarre choices regarding the proportions (the arms are actually too big) it can certainly be said that an excellent job has been done characterization, also extended to all supporting actors. The problem is the decidedly old-gen nature of the scenario, which uses polygonal constructions and very dated effects, making it difficult to find the slightest charm in a location which, with its many attractions, should play a central role in the economy of the countryside. The engine used is certainly not the one that moves Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, and this is evident not only from the 60 frames per second (fps) but also from the presence of even short uploads to access the various shops and extra activities. Furthermore, the low-level enemies found on the street tend to look a little too much alike and this only visually emphasizes the repetitiveness of the action. The dubbing in Japanese (but there is also in English, with subtitles in the same language) also draws on the cast of actors who lent their voices to the characters of Yakuza, and absolutely nothing can be said about the quality of the interpretations, always very convincing. However, it is a real pity that SEGA did not want to use the music from the original soundtrack of Hokuto no Ken for the game, replacing them with somewhat anonymous songs, unable to create the same involvement.", "date": "2018-10-01", "grade": "7.5"}
