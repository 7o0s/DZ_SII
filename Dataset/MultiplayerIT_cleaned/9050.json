That's the target of Big Fish Games, a hard core of fans but above all decidedly casual players, in practice a good portion of Nintendo Wii owners. All in all, developing a Mystery Case Files for the Nintendo console isn't a bad idea: the product's budget is clearly not particularly high and the control system offered by the Wii Mote moves very well with the peculiar puzzles and interactive elements designed by developers. It would therefore seem like a winning product thanks to a good combination of concept, control system and type of user, but appearances are deceiving. Well, not quite. A cure for all ills We were saying that this Mystery Case Files is the tenth in a series that started on PC but don't worry, you don't need to have played the others to understand the story of this episode for Nintendo Wii which is actually completely stand-alone. The plot, however, plays an important role and in fact it is a pity that it is a bit trivial and devoid of bite, considering that the entire gameplay revolves around it: in the role of a private investigator we will in fact be invited to a strange island from this Mr. Malgrave who believes he has discovered a substance that can cure disease and aging. It goes without saying that not everything is what it seems and that our alter-ego will only take a few seconds of loading to find himself on a boat near the island: it is the beginning of the game and a very short tutorial will help you understand how to ~move ~ within the various settings. The Malgrave Case is basically a sort of ~point & click~ and by moving the Wii Mote to the right or left we will be able to view the surrounding environment, interact with the elements of the scenario, collect objects and use our bag or other gadgets by interacting with their icons on the screen. The general visual quality is discreet, the settings are the true protagonists of the story and enjoy a certain complexity and attention to detail, betrayed however by the low graphic resolution and by a rather mediocre quality of the textures which in many cases clash with such as lighting effects and animated elements. The artists of Big Fish Studios have evidently concentrated above all on the two-dimensional artworks that make up most of the puzzles, we will talk about them shortly but here it is worth dwelling on the fact that, unfortunately, The Malgrave case appears too low-budget at certain times , especially from a technical point of view, and history certainly does not redeem these shortcomings. One controller to find them all The Malgrave Case is basically a point and click adventure based on solving numerous puzzles. Most of these puzzles follow a precise typology that we could define as the protagonist of the gameplay: in essence, we will find ourselves faced with a complex two-dimensional image made up of various graphic elements stacked and intertwined with each other. Our task will be to locate the objects indicated in a list in this chaos, aiming at them and selecting them with the Wii Mote. There is no time limit to do it but it is also not possible to click at random on the image, in the hope that the blindfolded goddess will assist us: therefore a keen eye and a lot of patience are needed. Despite being the main puzzles in the game, these puzzles are also the most boring and repetitive; much better to play them together via the bizarre multiplayer mode. Proceeding in the single-player adventure, in fact, it will be possible to unlock a multitude of images in which up to three players will have to identify the elements of the list before their opponents or, perhaps, before an individual countdown expires. It is a botched but still pleasant multiplayer mode, designed for the niche of users to whom the title is directed or for families looking for a videogame pastime with a decidedly casual flavor. The other puzzles that make up the structure of Il Caso Malgrave are undoubtedly more interesting and intelligent and often require concentration and ingenuity: for example, it will be necessary to use the objects found in the various scenarios to interact with the environment. The problem is that there are often no clues or objectives to guide our actions: this often leads to annoying moments of stalemate, forcing us to revisit the same settings all over again or, even worse, to sift through our pursehoping to find the right item without knowing what to look for.", "date": "2011-09-29", "grade": "5.8"}
