In general, the more systems there are, the more arduous and useless it becomes to go into detailing them all, because the real risk is that of losing the overall picture, which is what really matters when one has to account for the experience. For the review of Distant Worlds 2, however, we found ourselves in an unprecedented situation: not knowing where to start. Strategy at the highest level The fleet is fully customizable At its core Distant Worlds 2 is a 4X space strategy in which you must succeed in building a galactic empire, with the possibility of pausing the action at any time, to manage all aspects of the game. In terms of general objectives it is not far from a Stellaris, but going into the details we are faced with a game of a completely different magnitude, with so many things to do that initially we are completely blown away. Consider that just to create a game it takes several minutes, there are so many parameters to consider. So you have to familiarize yourself with the game system, which can take several hours, because there are really many elements to consider and a game vision that differs enormously from that of the competition, starting from the ability to completely customize your fleet and own stations, down to the smallest components. Here the basic diversity of the CodeForce title from its competitors already emerges because customization is not only an aesthetic choice, but also an economic one: do you want to create a fleet using components that require a certain material? Then you'll need to research that material by examining known planets and asteroids. Can't you find any because an opposing empire has taken possession of the biggest mines of the same? Then you have to buy it or start a war of conquest, with unpredictable outcomes (especially for the reaction of other empires and our own colonies). Do you want to entrust yourself completely to the merchants, who moreover live their activities independently, acting according to the orders of the moment? It is possible to do this and, indeed, understanding its behavior is essential to thrive. Do you want to think about all the other aspects except this one? Well, just put it in the hands of the artificial intelligence and you can ignore it for the rest of the game. The same goes for every other sector of the empire, which can be completely automated, including the military one, with specific functions that can be assigned to each fleet, which will therefore only need to give generic orders to, for example, set off to conquer a certain star system or searching for life at the edge of the known universe. Of course, artificial intelligence can have problems, especially in developing strategies that are too complex. So if you have something very specific in mind, it's best to do it manually. For example, if you want to converge several fleets on a single target to carry out a joint and contemporary attack, it is better to avoid automation, because there is a risk that the fleets start fighting in order of arrival, increasing losses. Be that as it may, with the expansion of the empire, delegating becomes simply necessary, because managing every single aspect can prove counterproductive and lose the big picture. A universe of possibilities Graphically it is very basic Let's face it: the most prominent element of Distant Worlds 2, the one that will literally make some players adore it, is also the one that will keep many others at arm's length. If we had to define it rather than strategic 4X, we would call it a strategic Photoshop, in the sense that the game system is so broad, versatile and full of tools that often the player is not called to understand what to do, but simply has to exploit the means his willingness to act out his wildest fantasies. Sure, there are some tactics that seem to work better than others, but it's hard to say which ones. That is, the scope for experimentation is so wide that it is difficult to even try to say how far one can go, when one intends to force the gameplay in a certain direction. Sometimes you succeed, sometimes you fail, but in each case you feel that the choices made have had an effect on what happened on the screen, for better or for worse. And this is the strongest point of Distant Worlds 2: you never feel that you have been overtaken by the game, but the agency is always very high. Say, during a campaign we suffered a surprise attack by an alliance dthe two opposing factions. The game map carries a large amount of information The attack was precise and ruthless and left us completely displaced, making us lose some colonies before being able to bring together part of our fleet to stop the enemy advance. At first we thought of a classic trick of the CPU, but examining the situation carefully we understood that, simply, the artificial intelligence had exploited our mistake, i.e. having underestimated the defense of a certain area of the space, thinking that from that part could not have come any concrete threat. We were so busy expanding on other fronts that we allowed enemies to organize and drive a wedge into our colonies, catching us off guard. Moreover, we also understood that we had provoked our opponents by going in search of a specific resource, whose trade we had curbed by causing prices to rise. So here we are attacked by a fast fleet, which made us understand how it was advisable to stop the wild expansion to consolidate the already colonized territories. In doing so we have also discovered resources that we had not taken into account and, in the long run, we have managed to restore a situation of substantial equilibrium, with which we have been able to maintain a lasting peace, which has guaranteed us a less threatening growth for the others. The game provides a lot of information Beautiful, is not it? In Distant Worlds 2 everything (or at least, a lot) seems to be possible, so much so that a title like Stellaris, despite its complexity, seems like the Bignami version of it. The problem is that, as you will understand, to do what is described you need to master the game system and doing it is not for everyone. And here we return once again to Photoshop: where for some the wealth of tools offered means having a very wide margin of intervention and the possibility of giving vent to one's creativity without limits, for others it means looking at mysterious screens which they cannot to make sense. Unfortunately, the integrated tutorial is of little use. That is, it explains a lot, but it doesn't really give you access to the complex beauty of the game. For this reason we can only recommend Distant Worlds 2 only to those who have some experience with 4X, because if you plan to use it as a debut title in the genre, the risk is that you end up overwhelmed by the amount of concepts that need to be learned in order to play decently and pass from the status of spectator of mysterious dynamics staged by poorly understood icons, to that of space strategist whose only limit is the universe itself. The weak points There are many beautiful moments in space From a technical point of view, the title of CodeForce unfortunately shows all its limits. We knew we weren't faced with a production that could aspire to have its say in terms of graphics or sound, but if we combine the rough aspect, both in the models and in the interface, with the underlying complexity, it is clear that it risks be repulsive to some. It should be noted that the interface itself has improved compared to that of the first chapter, but we are still far from being able to define it as pleasant. What we can guarantee you is that, once you get seriously involved, aesthetic gratification really becomes the last thought, but we're always there: it's another obstacle to overcome before being able to access something truly magnificent, but which lies well hidden under a harsh and inhospitable surface. Also noteworthy are some small problems in the missions, which on rare occasions are impossible to complete due to some bugs. It's only happened to us once, so we don't feel like penalizing Distant Worlds 2 for so little, also because we've recently seen much worse happen in much more famous and expensive titles, in terms of production.", "date": "2022-03-14", "grade": "8.5"}
