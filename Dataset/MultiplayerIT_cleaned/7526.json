Negative components, these, shared by a good portion of specialized critics and the public and which evidently have reached the ears of the Czech developers of MADFINGER Games loud and clear. The declared objective of this second chapter of the series, in fact, is to expand the range of the playful offer while correcting the technical defects that afflicted the prequel: without too many words, we can safely say that this goal has been achieved. Automatic for the people At MADFINGER Games, they don't pay too much attention to the plot, and Dead Trigger 2 is no exception: the scenario is always that of a humanity annihilated by an epidemic that transforms people into zombies, and the protagonist is part of the few survivors willing to claim his right to life with blows to the head. Nothing particularly original therefore, for a title that has preferred - rightly - to develop the most interesting innovations in more strictly playful areas. Starting with a control system that gets rid of many of the cumbersomeness that afflicted the first chapter, adopting an approach that is as drastic as it is effective. The virtual keys that in the original Dead Trigger were used to fire and reload the weapon have been completely eliminated here, making both processes automatic: therefore, it is enough to aim at a zombie's address to explode the bullets, with the software taking advantage of every moment he paused longer than usual to give the digital alter ego the order to replace the magazine. What to some might appear as an excessive simplification of the playful dynamics actually turns out to be a real godsend for Dead Trigger 2, finally playable as God commands and for this reason much more enjoyable and fun than its predecessor. If such a solution does not meet your tastes, the title still allows you to return to a manual control system, which we would however like to indicate only to do-it-yourself enthusiasts at all costs. The improvements made by MADFINGER Games certainly do not stop there, and involve that same play structure accused of being too repetitive and monotonous in the first episode. Dead Trigger 2 corrects many of the defects of the prequel, proving to be an excellent free to play title Hence, the hiding place of the survivors becomes a nerve center from which to buy new objects, enhance existing ones and modify one's equipment, a scenario that already in the early stages of the adventure is populated by a series of professional figures (doctor, gunsmith, scientist, etc.) that increase the value of their services as they level up. Such an element has the double function of increasing the depth of the experience and inevitably of serving as a source of income for MADFINGER Games through in-app purchases: we must give credit to the developers for not having overplayed their hand in this sense, but how it happens in every free to play, even in Dead Trigger 2 moving forward without spending money is only possible on condition that you proceed slowly and with a few more difficulties, often repeating the same stages several times to accumulate the necessary funds for the most coveted upgrades. Also noteworthy are the marked improvements as regards the nature and variety of missions, which in the first chapter ended up getting boring quickly: here the efforts of the Czech team to propose more diversified objectives, capable of maintaining a higher rate, are evident of interest although the levels always settle on fairly small dimensions. And then there is the graphic aspect, an area in which Dead Trigger 2 confirms itself as one of the most visually impressive mobile titles of recent times: the settings amaze for their level of detail and special effects, while the polygonal models of the zombies prove to be solid and well animated, enjoying moreover a greater differentiation involving their behavior on the field in addition to mere aesthetics.", "date": "2013-10-31", "grade": "8.4"}
