{"name": "Arx Fatalis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/arx-fatalis_a.html", "text": "Arx In the presentation prior to the actual game, a good part of what awaits the player already unfolds. A kingdom, that of Arx, based on the forced coexistence of distinct races such as humans, dwarves, trolls and goblins. Inexplicably, the pseudo-tranquil routine of the population was altered by something totally illogical and inexplicable: the decline of the energy of a seriously ill sun, whose vitality decreased over the years until it disappeared. It is easy to imagine the consequences of this catastrophe; a little less understand the consequent reactions of the commoners. In the five years of solar decline that acted as an antechamber to dark and frozen lands, the inhabitants of Arx managed to transmigrate underground, managing to build a congenial habitat for their survival. And here comes our connection to the dark world of Arx Fatalis: a fearless hero named Am Shaegar, whose meaning is ~the man with no name~ precisely because of that faltering and temporarily lost memory. We will therefore wake up in a goblin prison without knowing why, deprived of weapons and of the same clothes. Not even to mention the first, clear, goal of the game: escape. Ego Points <br>[Chapter One]</br> To characterize the growth and actions of one's character, it will be advisable to allocate an adequate number of points to the nine skills, following a process as close as possible to one's requests. These are the skills implemented in Arx Fatalis: Stealth That is everything related to moving clandestinely. Based on this score you will walk more or less silently, you will be able to hide in the shadows, you will be able to attack an enemy from behind and even pickpocket the various unfortunates. Technical skill Allows you to open doors or padlocked chests. Intuition As this score increases, the perceptive possibilities will increase, such as finding secret passages and pitfalls, but also to trade with greater profit. The sky in a room Even before waking up, literally in our underwear, it will be necessary to distribute the skill points destined for the four main characteristics (strength, intelligence, dexterity and constitution) and the nine derivatives of which you will find an exhaustive diagram on the side and on the following page. Our character will thus take shape and substance, he will be able to perform or not certain actions depending on his scores and, always following the various rankings, equip weapons and armor. Arx Fatalis relies on the subjective view to highlight a background full of elements of interaction, whether they are of primary utility or mere furniture. To advance in the game it will be necessary to sift through each location with a rake in order to find clues or necessary items, and it is precisely on these factors that Arkane Studios has built the solid game structure. Removing heavy bricks might reveal a keyhole in the floor, or moving a pillow from a goblin bed might reveal an all-important key. But in this case be careful not to get caught red-handed: you will be accused of theft! Interaction with NPCs is also the fulcrum of this French game, reinvigorated by a rather calibrated AI. It will therefore be necessary to be careful in risky situations to move with a certain criterion, paying attention to the sound of one's steps or one's position towards the light, also aided by a bar of light-shadow in perfect Splinter Cell style. Furthermore, killing a key character of the game will affect, in addition to attracting the ire of the companions, on the quests themselves, which could inevitably become complicated by causing the player to have to take alternative routes. Ultimately, this is one of the most driving features of Arx Fatalis, or rather the almost totalitarian freedom to act according to one's intuitions. Aware that every action will be followed by a consequence. Ego Points <br>[Chapter Two]</br> Ethereal Bond In addition to warning hostile creatures, also providing valuable information about them, it increases the speed of regeneration of mana points. Item Knowledge Useful for repairing equipment, brewing potions, and identifying unknown items. Magic Allows you to access the ten levels of spells available. It also determines the protective ability to magic. Close combat Increases the damage caused to the opponent with special bonuses if a special weapon is used. Projectile When using long-range weapons, grants bonuses to damage done to the enemy. Defense Increases capacity di use the shield and, at the same time, the armor class. Rock of Ages In this kind of games derived from the ancient PC tradition, those in subjective to be clear, it is always difficult to maintain, in the re-proposition on the pad, the same feeling resulting from the use of the mouse and keyboard. In the case of Arx Fatalis, the system adopted by Arkane Studios is appropriate and effective. By implementing the jump and combat functions on the backbones, the French developers ensured the practicality and immediacy of the most frequent commands, allocating the actions and the complex system of magic to the fronts. The choice of being able to assign the pre-established selection of two items to the tiny black and white keys is excellent. On the directional cross instead the quick menu while, as usual, the analog sticks will correspond to the movements of the character. On the object screen front, we encounter some organizational flaws, which most of the time create imbalances due to the excessive inconvenience of certain operations. The combat system comes in the form of a rich range based on swords and magic. Hitting an opponent with different shots is immediately fruitful, based mostly on directing the left stick in due course to make the desired shot. It will therefore be possible to throw blows to the right and left, thrusts to the belly and blows to the head. More complex, but at the same time fascinating, is the structuring of the spells. To cast a spell, it will first be necessary to find the runes necessary for its invocation, as well as having the adequate sap mana. Each rune will correspond to a series of combinations to be carried out with the D Pad which will imply, in the case of multiple elements per spell, the reproduction of the exact sequence. In order to facilitate the execution of a spell even in hectic moments, it will be possible to prepare up to five spells in advance and then select them in a specially created quick menu. The spells will vary from the canonical fireball and enchanted dart, to the useful possibility of lighting a fire if in the presence of flammable material. The latter is linked to the widely praised interactivity, as it is indispensable for cooking food or forging new weapons. Hole in my soul The decision to set the labyrinthine Arx Fatalis entirely underground must have created much more than a headache for the French designers. The risk was that of making the player's path towards the light dispersive, and adequately differentiating the various play areas must not have been a smooth walk. Yet they succeeded, thanks to purely level design finds and many small aesthetic details. In this sense, the excellent variety and quality of the textures of the various game environments, unfortunately a little lacking in polygons, have facilitated this process. Although not always animated properly, also by virtue of a monotonous lip, the models of the NPCs are also quite good, well characterized and detailed. Even the light sources carve out due space in this applause, always reliable in their folkloric intent. The same thing cannot be said of the reproduction of shadows and water, both treated to the bare minimum. The work performed by Arkane Studios in terms of sound checking is fluctuating, which contrasts some valuable sound effects with others that are really poorly cared for, both in terms of diversification and timing. Finally, the dubbing entirely in Italian, made up of actors capable of inventing the various slangs of each race, should be framed. Comment Arx Fatalis is therefore proposed as a valid alternative, to say the least, to the already illustrious department colleagues present on Xbox. An articulated and at the same time easy to use title, so much so that it can bring non-lovers closer to the genre and also those who have always disdained subjective RPGs. Ultimately a must-buy for all fans of this trend born on PC, and a semi-mandatory test drive for those who are not passionate, but who are perhaps looking for a decidedly well-made title. Pros: Freedom of action and interaction to sell. Correct control system. Exemplary dubbing. Graphically (almost always) up to par. Cons: Difficult item menu. Poor sound effects. The RPG genre has always been one of the greatest catalysts for the attention of the gamer public, be it Western or Eastern. The latter, it is well known, never answers the call of the lady, indeed miss, Xbox teacher, who by dint of writing absent on her registro almost resigned herself to not seeing her student's face. In contrast to this ominous lack there are precisely those Western role-playing games which, although still a little lacking in number to form an assorted class, draw heavily from the PC universe with all the benefits of the case. One of these is undoubtedly Arx Fatalis, a transposition of the game of the same name released on PC in autumn 2002 by the same creators, the French Arkane Studios, with the clear intention of stealing the coveted scepter of best RPG from the Xbox soft library.", "date": "2004-01-29", "grade": null}
