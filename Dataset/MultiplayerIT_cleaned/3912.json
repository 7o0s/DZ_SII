Incidentally, it is possible to play it on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 (also backwards compatible on PS5). Will it be worth waiting for? Not really, as you can understand by reading the review of Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree, a game that shines in some aspects, but is completely lost in others. Visual style Atone's visual style is fascinating Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree begins by asking the player to tune a musical instrument, after a dialogue between what appear to be old friends. From here one could imagine that music will be central to the gaming experience, also given the title, unfortunately this is not exactly the case. It can be said that it is part of the experience, but at the same time it appears underexploited, almost counterproductive for the fragile balance of the game. But let's try to explain better. The Wildboy Studios title is a mix of different genres: top-down RPG, puzzle adventure and rhythm game. It tells of Estra's journey to the sacred Ancient Tree in search of the causes of a terrible evil that is afflicting the kingdom of men. The girl has lost her father and her entire village due to events that are told in the prologue and the weight of her lineage rests on her. On his way he will meet friends and enemies, he will have to overcome dark labyrinths full of mysteries, ancient ruins and remote places that have not seen human beings for years. all inspired by Norse mythology. His scenario is truly fascinating thanks to some well-chosen stylistic choices. Although technically very simple, the choice to draw everything using only elementary geometric figures and stylized objects makes just walking around the scenarios, divided into sub-maps (therefore no open world) a pleasant affair. Too bad it's also the best part of the game, because ultimately Atone: Heart of the Elder Tree doesn't quite know what it wants to be and compensates for some of its limitations with truly questionable choices. For example, it entrusts extremely didactic documents that are found around the maps with the task of providing the player with information on Norse mythology, central to the plot, which end up breaking the atmosphere instead of enhancing it so much they seem to have come out of an encyclopedia. Confusion Atone's fights are transformed into video clips That said, the main problem of Atone, which ends up compromising the whole experience a bit, is that the stylistic refinement is not homogeneous, in the sense that where it is visually captivating and original, it fails to do the same with the mechanics of game, actually making several mistakes, while trying an approach of his own. Let's start with the fights, which all take place against pre-set enemies and at precise times, thus resulting in a highly narrative. The clashes are handled like a rhythm game, i.e. the player must press two or four keys (depending on the selected difficulty level) at the right time, following the rhythm of the music and the prompts displayed on the screen, to load the shots. You simply have to try to make as few mistakes as possible if you want to get the better of your opponent. The music tracks are really beautiful, it must be said, but it's the system itself that doesn't work as it should, because instead of engaging it ends up distracting due to the confusion it creates on the screen and its being a clear departure from the exploratory stage. Some puzzles are nice, but the difficulty doesn't increase steadily In short, it does not bind very well with other game systems and does not offer particularly interesting answers during execution. He stands there, makes the clashes spectacular by transforming them into small video clips, but that's all. It is as if it were a mini-game in its own right, which is activated when needed and does not add or take away much from the gameplay as a whole, so much so that by completely eliminating the possibility of losing, a big difference in terms of experience is not perceived. Indeed, those who are not particularly fond of rhythm games may find a cause for relief. Having said this, a game system which, detached from the gameplay, does not involve traumas, is evidently not organic with the rest, or has its own objectives. Another problem are the tones chosen for the narration, which does not seem to know exactly what it wants to be . Faced with some dialogues written in an extremely colloquial way and others that mimic a higher writing, one rightly wonders if whoever wrote the game had a line to follow or has improadvised, trying to soften the tones where possible, but thus creating paradoxical situations. Fights are played like a rhythm minigame In particular, the relationship with the guiding spirit that accompanies Estra is told with the usual Disney comedy clichs, but without ever going too deeply and without a writing quality that stands out, ending up being a big wish but I can't. In reality, this tendency to frustrate good ideas is found throughout the game, between puzzles of variable difficulty, which are sometimes very easy and other very difficult, without any gradualness, between an exploration that offers rare surprises to the bravest and between a way to grow the character whose weight you don't feel much during the entire adventure. The final idea is that of a weak game in which some features have been implemented for compensation. Furthermore, he is unable to carry on his themes as he would like, often losing them along the way. Overall it is not terrifying and in its own way it lets itself be played, but when speaking of it more defects than merits come to mind, obviously something must have gone wrong.", "date": "2023-01-26", "grade": "5.5"}
