Usually, however, those who love it are in a clear minority compared to the entire school population, a circumstance that catches the eye if we analyze the sad performance of Italian students. Faster! finally offers an opportunity for revenge, albeit partial, to all those poor children and young people who can no longer hear of perimeters, areas and apothemas: the satisfaction for them will be great in discovering that this time it will not be the usual monsters who are beaten not very intelligent but simple geometric figures, specifically the (not) nice colored squares. Side by side Fastar!, acronym of Fight Angry Squares: The unction RPG, was born mainly as a side-scrolling action RPG, whose only aim is to defeat the enemies encountered along the way in the shortest possible time. If so far nothing appears particularly new or interesting, the nature of the adversaries that one will have to face remains to be pointed out: as already mentioned, they will be two-dimensional squares, of increasing size until they become real giant ~squares~. Sure that of all the terrifying monsters a hero might encounter during an adventure, a simple flat regular figure doesn't seem to cause much concern; in reality, these annoying squares must absolutely not be underestimated due to the two methods they use to attack, both very effective: the thrust, simple but harmful, and the forward rotation, such as to make the 4 edges present on the evil quadrilateral of the blades sharp. Obviously then, a smaller square corresponds to faster and more unpredictable movements, while as the figures grow in size they will assume increasingly awkward attitudes. In addition to the size, however, the squares differ from each other in color and certainly not for aesthetic reasons only: a red square will in fact turn out to be on fire, inflicting more damage even on simple contact, a green one will be very agile and difficult to hit while a black will be endowed with greater resistance and aggressiveness. It will be up to the player, from time to time, to be able to find the right attack tactic to permanently erase these horrendous figures. Although undoubtedly the most curious part of Fastar! it concerns only the particular enemies present, the hero charged with defending the world from the geometrical assault certainly cannot fail to be remembered; the young fighter will be equipped only and exclusively with a broadsword, which can be used with the virtual button at the bottom right of the iPhone display (but the control system can be selected from three other choices, i.e. by means of an accelerometer, swiping a finger or with one hand alone in portrait mode), and a magical power to choose at the beginning from a series of options, ranging from the power of fire to that of lightning, from super speed to momentary invulnerability, according to a classic but simplified scheme of the magic present in all RPGs. Even the upgrade level of the character reflects the simplicity and immediacy with which the game is presented to the purchaser: only three items, Defense, Attack and Life, with no inventory to manage. The destruction of a square will leave cash bonuses on the ground, which can be spent on upgrades in the village located in the middle of the short adventures that will be faced. Precisely the brevity and speed of the various actions represent the novelty of this nice iPhone game: in fact, finishing it entirely will usually never take more than 10 minutes at the highest difficulty level, but the challenge will be to start over every time to beat the previously established time, unfortunately comparing it only with oneself (in fact, no system of achievements or online scores is implemented). Not a fight to get more kills, therefore, but a perennial race against time. To break the monotony though, the developers of Fastar! have implemented numerous extra modes, short but fun, all variants of the original game concept: ranging from the one-hour marathon of fights to the fight in the arena, not forgetting a series of battles with squares of the same color, to learn to face them, or only with the giant ones, in the mode pompously called ~Goliath~. In short, fun in all ways, with the only constant being geometric destruction. Analyzing the title technically, one can only be satisfied even in the absence of incredible effects or textures in very high definition, which in any case would have been totally out of context: the graphics are clean, sparse, but nice and in a hand-drawn cartoon style, perfectly in the atmsurreal sphere of the game. By way of example, it should be noted the clever way in which the scenario behind the protagonist changes as he progresses through the game: a simple dotted line, with the symbol of a cutting scissor indicated, will physically mark the caesura between a mountain landscape and a themed one forest or citizen, just as if it all took place through the roll of a paper storyboard. Finally, the music is standard, which while not disturbing certainly does not shine for originality. Price: 0.79 The tested version is 1.0.1 Apple Store Links", "date": "2010-09-03", "grade": "7.7"}
