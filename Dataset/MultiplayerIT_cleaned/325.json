With some good impressions and some doubts, therefore, we approached this frenetic and strategic title in a definitive way. We are therefore ready to tell you our final impressions in the review of Red Solstice 2: Survivors. Trip to the red planet Red Solstice 2: Survivors: the welcome of Mars As always, let's start from the narrative premise: an ecological disaster has reduced the chances of survival on Earth to the bone, for this reason the terrestrial colonists decide to take refuge on Mars to seek new hope for mankind. Here, as we have already been able to see in the first chapter of the saga, the settlers will find themselves facing a planet that is anything but inclined to host new ~tenants~. The story of Red Solstice 2 continues where it left off and follows the story of an Executor (this is the name of the iconic units of the franchise) in search of survivors and a way to prolong survival and human resistance on the red planet. A clearly not revolutionary or suggestive narrative, but a solid and well-structured narrative through the various stages of the campaign. In Red Solstice 2: Survivors, the plot is a mere tool in the hands of the developers to give the player a pretext to grapple with the real beating heart of the work: the gameplay. Represented by the two sides of the combat system: one more strategic and the other more frenetic. Strategy and frenzy Red Solstice 2: Survivors: fire and flames Red Solstice 2: Survivors is a real-time tactical RPG that has a system divided into two distinct sides: action planning and missions on the Martian soil. The first phase, the more strategic one, consists in exploring the global map of Mars through a screen that recalls the use of the probe on the planets in Mass Effect. During this phase we will have to move the flying base in search of scans or hot spots to extract material, but there will also be some points related to the infestation of the planet. During this type of exploration, in fact, some pop-ups will also signal us the possibility of entering the heart of the action by deploying our team, consequently starting the second phase, which is the more frenetic one. Once in the action, we will be able choose, in a dedicated menu, the composition of the team that will support our alter-ego. There are six classes: assault, medic, heavy, sharpshooter, demolisher and scout. Each of them has a specific equipment and its precise use on the battlefield. The sharpshooter will be effective from range, assault in crowd control, etc. Creating a balanced team capable of dealing with any type of situation will be essential. The missions of Red Solstice 2: Survivors are in fact very punitive and the margin of error is not contemplated. Also because defeat in this game always involves a huge loss of resources, an element more precious than water in the desert, we assure you. Red Solstice 2: Survivors: The team prepares The action on the battlefield remains frenetic (even if less than skirmishes or coop games) and conditioned by the obligation to use strategies that go to preserve our team. Moving our alter ego behind cover, making sure you always have an escape route available, for example, will be essential. The isometric view guarantees excellent control of the situations in progress and the mouse and keyboard are fundamental in this. Even the tactical pause, a great request from the community, is something that in some moments comes in really useful going to break the feeling of oppression in certain moments, guaranteeing the right pauses for reflection in some situations. However, what emerged from our definitive test is a contrasting feeling: on the one hand we find the excellent quantity of situations and possibilities proposed, on the other a disarming repetitiveness of assets and settings which in the long run can really tire. Even the level design, which initially seemed very effective to us, has shown numerous ups and downs throughout the campaign. Despite this, the biggest problem is the lack of information and suggestions especially during the early stages of the campaign. Getting familiar with all the tasks to be performed and the actions to be performed is really complex if you are not an expert in the genre and the franchise and this cannot and should not be taken for granted. Red Solstice 2: Survivors: Chaos prevails The Skirmish mode is the mode that exploits the most, in our view, the potential of the gameplay created by Ironward. The cooperation of up to eight players against increasingly numerous and complex hordes of enemies is something that enhances the player's skill and his ability to play as a team. All tactics therefore emerge in these moments in which the common good must prevail compared to one's ego. Also in this case the game suffers from the aforementioned problems, related to level design, world building and asset recycling, but unlike the campaign, it excludes the variable of the allied AI, which during the solo game takes control of the companions of squad. In fact, during our single games, we have repeatedly run into dangerous bugs related to soldiers who did not follow orders or who simply forgot to fight. This is obviously avoided if our team is controlled by all real players who know how to behave on the battlefield.", "date": "2021-06-22", "grade": "7.2"}
