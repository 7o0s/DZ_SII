{"name": "Mario Golf Toadstool Tour", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-golf-toadstool-tour-2.html", "text": "Now watch this drive The main novelty introduced by the Japanese programmers, in order to make a title that is certainly not a niche in itself accessible to an even wider audience, must be sought in the inclusion of a double control system, with two integrated modes that can be used in any moment. In summary, the classic launch system (A button), selection of the force of the shot (B button) and accuracy (A or B) has not been accompanied by a second, all via the A button, which goes beyond the need to grasp the timing for the last step leaving the onerous task automatically. This is clearly an inclusion dedicated to younger Nintendo fans or users unfamiliar with the pad, and which should therefore be discarded a priori by any experienced gamer. As per tradition, Mario Golf offers various extra modes that accompany the main classic one; in the latter, the player is called to tackle one of the 18-hole courses available, obviously trying to finish with fewer strokes than his opponents. As for the alternative methods, there is really a lot of irons in the fire. In fact, the Ring Race requires you to throw the ball through rings scattered along the track, while similarly in the Coin Race the aim is to get as close as possible to a group of coins suspended in the air to collect as many as possible. On the other hand, in the Slot Machine, before each hole it is necessary to stop a slot which will determine a wood and a pair of irons that can be used on the playing field, inhibiting all the other clubs. Finally, Speed Golf, as the name suggests, rewards the player capable of completing a round in the shortest possible time. Variety is certainly not what is missing from the latest Camelot effort which, as in all sports games, offers its best in multiplayer. In fact, with support for up to 4 players, playing Mario Golf with friends undoubtedly increases the level of involvement and challenge, especially with companions with a good technical level. In games with 2 or more human players, the possibility of disturbing the player with phrases ranging from ~Come on, you can do it~ to sneezing just before hitting the ball is also appreciable. Nintendosity Returning to the control system, except for the novelty of the simplified mode, everything remains on extremely classic and tested mechanics well known by anyone who has only touched the genre of golf games. The choice of club, the distance from the hole, the ideal trajectory, the wind all as per tradition. And in fact this is the only real limit of Mario Golf Toadstool Tour, that is to say that it is based on a mechanic that, after all, is several years old. This means that playing the latest Camelot effort, for those who have had experience with games based on this sport, can prove to be an experience full of deja-vu or in any case without particular surprises. Obviously this sensation can be more or less markedly mitigated by the marked Nintendo spirit of the title in question: yes, because Toadstool Tour is a 100% Nintendo title, with a truly unique appearance and charm. The sound component, full of characteristic phrases and verses of the characters present, is completed by a truly spot-on musical accompaniment, never intrusive and very suitable for accompanying the games. Also from a graphic point of view, the work done by the programmers is undoubtedly appreciable, even more so considering the time that has passed from the American publication to the European one; especially as regards the characters, the modeling is really excellent with a great deal of detail and impeccable fidelity. The paths are also good, albeit with some drops in quality in some fortunately limited passages, while the quality of the textures appears to be of a good level on every occasion. Some notes could instead be moved to the management of the camera with the c-stick, delegated to navigation within the path and not always perfect and easy to use. Nonetheless, these are slight imperfections for an artfully packaged, fun and appreciable product, but far from surprising. Comment Mario Golf Toadstool Tour also confirms the excellent tradition of the series on Gamecube, in addition to Camelot's ability to package a product without major flaws, fun, full of extra modes and excellent in multiplayer. The only limit therefore lies in its very nature, namely that of being a golf game based on mechanics largely seen and revised capable of causing more than a few deja-vu in players already accustomed to the genre in question. The final mark must therefore be taken as the mean of divdifferent factors, and in this perspective it can vary positively or negatively depending on personal attitudes and preferences. Pros: Immediate and fun playability Excellent graphics and spot on sound Large amount of extras Cons: Game mechanics too classic for some Some problems with the camera Some slight quality drops in the courses Almost a full year after its publication on American soil, the latest chapter in the Mario Golf series has finally landed on the old continent as well, obviously on Gamecube. Born at the hands of Camelot on N64 developing the structure of Hot Shots Golf around the Nintendo world, the series immediately gained excellent feedback thanks to an accessible but at the same time not lacking in depth gameplay, combined with the sympathy and charm of Mario, Luigi, Bowser and company. Nonetheless, the transition to a console with greater potential such as the Gamecube must necessarily imply a development and improvement not only from a technical point of view, but equally from a playful one.", "date": "2004-07-08", "grade": null}
