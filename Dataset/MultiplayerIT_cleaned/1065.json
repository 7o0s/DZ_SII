{"name": "Call of Duty: L'ora degli eroi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-lora-degli-eroi.html", "text": "When duty calls! Call of Duty narrates the inflated events, videogame speaking, of the Second World War: we are in the 40s, Hitler with his Nazi army is invading the whole of Europe without scruples. You will take the side of the allied forces with the aim of stopping the crazy plan of the Nazis. During the game you will not play a single character, but you will experience the tragic experience of war from three points of view: initially you will take on the role of two Russian soldiers (the first male, the second female), while later you will command a British soldier. Each fighter will have different skills: the Soviet woman, for example, is a very skilled marksman, while the English soldier is able to place powerful explosives. This feature will allow the missions to be quite varied and never too repetitive. The places to visit will be quite numerous, in fact we will go from Russia to North Africa, up to Germany itself. During the journey you will never be alone, but you will act in cooperation with other companions, who will be identified by enemies thanks to an icon above their heads. Clearly the allies will be maneuvered by the CPU, but, as always happens in these cases, the ~big~ work will be up to you; however, on several occasions their livelihood will prove useful, especially in the missions in which you will play the sniper woman, where the positions of the enemies will be continuously reported to you. Speaking of the latter, they are equipped with a discreet AI, but above all they will often and willingly attack you in a group. In any case, the difficulty of the game will never be too high nor frustrating, and with a little patience and tactics you will be able to get to the bottom of every situation (in any case it will be possible to select three difficulty levels). A ~negative~ note is represented by the possibility of saving only when you reach a checkpoint and not everywhere as happened in the pc version: if you are defeated before reaching a save point, you will therefore be forced to start over. The weapons are present in large numbers, and vary according to the soldier you will play: you will have various types of rifles at your disposal, such as the Browning, the M1 Garand, Mosin-Nagrant, Sten and others, and an excellent arsenal of machine guns, namely the 'Mp40, the Thompson, DPM and so on, finally arriving at the grenade launcher. But that's not all, as in some sections of the game you'll take the reins of the tanks, thanks to which you'll be able to wreak utter havoc with ease. Mastering your alter ego will be a rather simple task, thanks to the excellent testing of the commands as well as the precision with which they respond. The only flaw concerns the not too precise aiming system, caused by the excessive sensitivity of the analog stick. However, this neo afflicts almost all shooters on Ps2, and unfortunately also in this case the problem has not been solved. Technical Analysis The biggest flaws unfortunately reside in the graphics sector. In fact, we find ourselves decidedly far from the PC versions with settings that are not technically made at their best and at times a bit angular, but above all we note the absence of particular graphic effects typical of the best productions. Another defect concerns the dancer frame-rate, which shows itself to be decidedly hesitant in the most chaotic situations. The situation fortunately improves with the textures of characters and weapons, not exceptional but still of decent quality. The situation improves on Gamecube and Xbox, especially as regards texture resolution and graphic cleaning, but otherwise remains quite similar, with slowdowns present in all versions. While the graphics aren't as exciting as a whole, the atmosphere of the Second World War has been recreated quite well: the devastated buildings, the bombers suddenly appearing from the sky, the bullets flying everywhere in the air, the sound of the bombs being thrown at land help to identify the player to the fullest in their role. To further assist the atmosphere there is an excellent audio sector, consisting of exciting music that blends perfectly with the context, and realistic and well-sampled sound effects. To this we add the screams and incitements of the companions in attacking the enemy, interpreted by a rather good dubbing (completely in Italian). Comment Call of Duty: Hour of Heroes is overall a good title able to entertain the user, thanks above all to a valuable atmosphere, a well-calibrated difficulty and a good longevity (15-20 hours of play, then adding the online game). Unfortunately there is to be assertedI also know that the graphics are not very convincing from any point of view, the hesitant frame-rate annoys, and the inaccurate aiming system is quite frustrating in the long run. In any case, if you are looking for a good console war game with which to spend a few pleasant hours, you might think about the Activision title. PROS Atmosphere of the Second World War recreated very well Excellent sound sector Difficulty well calibrated CONS Graphics a bit disappointing Aim sometimes inaccurate Frame-rate dancer While probably possessing the largest and most varied portfolio of titles ever, it must however be noted that there is a field where until now the black monolith has never managed to excel: we are talking about FPS, a genre that has never found itself perfectly at comfortable on Ps2 and which, with rare exceptions, does not include particularly prominent titles. Despite this, Activision has also decided to try his luck in the console universe (also with Xbox and Gamecube, therefore) by placing Call of Duty on the market: heroes' hour, an unpublished title belonging to the acclaimed Call of Duty franchise, very famous on Personal Computers.", "date": "2005-01-07", "grade": null}
