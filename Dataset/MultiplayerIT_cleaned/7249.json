{"name": "Allineali tutti!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/129560-pokemon-link-battle-allineali-tutti.html", "text": "The Nintendo and Game Freak brand in all these years - which for those who have lost count are eighteen - has generated tons of spin-offs of all kinds, but the most atypical are certainly among those we preferred: not RPGs like Pokmon Ranger or Pokmon Mystery Dungeon, but bizarre hybrids like the still hilarious Pokmon Pinball and the cute Pokmon Link! The latter, dated 2006, was developed by Genius Sorority and, unlike the various Pokmon Colosseum made by the same company, surprised precisely by its puzzle game formula which still remained faithful to the collecting spirit of the franchise. Eight years later, Genius Sorority and Nintendo try again with a real sequel which, thanks to some novelties, has proved to be an equally fun and far from superficial pastime. Pikachu fans and friends be warned! Pokemon Link: Battle! is a super fun puzzle game full of levels to play and monsters to catch Tetris with Pikachu In the beginning Pokmon Link: Battle! it can also be quite confusing, mostly because it mixes various mechanics in terms of gameplay without explaining them comprehensively. The tutorials that intersperse the first stages are in fact quite superficial, and to understand how to play it is advisable to take a look at the more in-depth explanations in the appropriate menu. Or read the next few lines: although it is one of those titles that is easier to play than to explain, we will still try to give you an idea of its peculiar mechanics. To begin with, the scenario is an island divided into thirteen settings which, in turn, are each divided into six stages. Not all settings are accessible immediately and not all are unlocked in the same order, however the goal is always the same: to capture the pokmon that we will meet in each stage. Each stage, in fact, offers certain pokmon in a precise order, plus other ~secrets~ that are encountered only by satisfying certain conditions. To catch a pokmon we will have to reset its life points, which brings us to the lower screen of the console. In fact, there we see the typical ~match 3~ puzzle game grid, full of smileys depicting various types of pokmon. The basic idea is simple: by aligning three identical pokmon, vertically or horizontally, we will make them disappear, with two consequences: first, the emptied boxes will be filled by the fall of the ones above and, second, the pokmon represented by the aligned smileys will literally attack what we're challenging, inflicting damage on it. It is also possible to align up to six pokmon at a time, and from five onwards the attacks carried out by the pokmon in question will hit multiple targets, useful if you are fighting more than one pokmon at the same time. Finally, there is the Link Time which is activated after having consecutively eliminated at least one row of three and four pokmon: during this temporary moment of advantage we will be able to create combinations from only two pokmon, thus eliminating more and more and faster, perhaps up to completely emptying the grid to substantially increase the bonus to the damage inflicted by the attacking pokmon. Between a combination of boxes and the attack of the pokmon in question, in fact, there is a very short period of time that will allow us to eliminate other boxes by increasing the power of the attack with each new combo. So far, Pokmon Link: Battle! it really looks like a completely academic puzzle game and we must admit that at the beginning we also turned up our noses at the repetitiveness of the first, very simple stages. But looks are deceiving... The 3D effect Absent. Long live the synthetic. He who hesitates is lost The first twist, so to speak, is the first of three support slots, which unlocks at the start of the third zone. In practice, all the captured pokmon fill up our PokDex, just like in a real game of the series, and can be ~equipped~ in the support slots which, basically, serve to make the pokmon that we want also appear on the grid and not only those foreseen by the internship. The reason is simple: in Pokmon Link: Battle! the balance of power between the different types of monsters takes over, so that a combination of fire pokmon will inflict more damage to a grass type while a rock pokmon will receive less from an electric attack and so on. Considering the predominance of pokmon of a certain type in each stage, the possibility of bringing the pokmon of the opposite element into the field through the support slots offers us a small advantage from the beginning of the game. As if that weren't enough, some pokmon are able to put to sleep, paralyze or stun thetarget, thus allowing us to stem its assaults. After all, we too have a vital energy indicator, and some pokmon that we will meet will do everything to reset it, and not just limiting themselves to just hitting us - transforming the game, that is, into a race against time - but also intervening on the grid with increasingly complicated and nefarious powers, between pokmon that replace those we are aligning, others that invert or mix the boxes, still others that literally break through the grid and occupy a portion of it, narrowing the play area and sending all our alignment plans. Between a combination of Chansey to heal us a little and a Ditto to use as a wild card, the player is forced to think frantically about how to coordinate his moves on the grid to unleash combos and chain reactions. After all, the score is not only used to please one's skills, but also to bring out secret pokmon in the various stages and to unlock even more: there is no shortage of variety, with stages that change according to the time of day or the day of the week and pokmon that can only be made to appear by equipping some specific ones within the same stage or by capturing others using a certain type of attack. In short, compared to the first, very simple internships, the last ones are really infernal and will put the best reflexes and glance to the test.", "date": "2014-03-17", "grade": "8.0"}
