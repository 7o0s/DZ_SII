Over the years, many video games have dedicated entire levels to this kind of representation, which always catches on thanks to the bright colors of the candy canes or candied cherries. The developers of the Korean Come2uS team have seen fit to base their new video game for the iOS platform on this very theme, filling the screen of our devices with sweets and treats in an infinite cascade, whose protagonist is none other than a chocolate crunchy. Not just any crunchy, however: a shrewd and courageous crunchy, who has the goal of recovering his little cocoa friends while a huge cascade of milk arrives menacingly behind him. Here, at this point you can go eat something. Done? Well, we were saying: the protagonist of Chocohero is a nice black candy that falls, in a continuous and virtually infinite motion, crossing scenarios with different shades and gradually full of new obstacles to overcome. With the river of milk flowing imperiously behind him, in fact, the challenge will be precisely to continue sliding down before it overwhelms him, in the meantime trying to collect the objects necessary to complete the mission. The approach chosen for the game is typical of ultra-arcade with a ~survival~ structure, i.e. that kind of video game in which you try, in each game, to survive as long as possible, setting new duration records and gradually to reveal what the particular virtual world has to offer, in this specific case an avalanche of goodies. However, there are some interesting breaking elements with respect to the classic formula that has been proposed for years now, indeed with great success, on the App Store. We'll see them in a moment, time to change the paragraph. Sweet to survive In games with a ~survival~ structure, the duration record is attempted in each game, but fundamentally the dynamics do not change. The more you go on, the more difficult it is to survive, the speed increases, any enemies as well and so on, up to the inevitable game over. In Chocohero things change, however, because each new record corresponds to new objectives, effectively making the game always different rather than always the same. In the first ~stint~, for example, we are asked to collect three of our crunchy friends, and once we have succeeded, the game ends. In the second ~stint~ the stakes go up, the kibbles become five and maybe we also have to collect something else at the same time. Notwithstanding the difficulty, in short, new reasons are created to go forward and explore the scenarios, which during our interminable ~fall~ change in color and ~ornaments~. To move the chocolate hero we'll have to use the accelerometer built into the device, tilting it left and right so that the character moves accordingly. Furthermore, having collected a certain number of stars, we will be able to touch the touch screen to activate a ~fury mode~ which allows us to destroy any obstacle along the way and thus save ourselves from difficult situations, when the avalanche of milk will have almost run over us. The sweets present in each stage not only have the task of visually characterizing that particular location, but also act as obstacles for our descent, as well as hosting the objects that we have the task of collecting on their surface. When we are favored by speed, we can break these sweets and go through them in rapidity, but if the obstacles are found in rapid succession then the only way to overcome them is to slide over them, using up precious seconds. Fortunately, there is no shortage of bonuses that can help us out, such as alarm clocks (which stop the flow of milk for a few moments) or bombs (which destroy the platforms in an instant). Between one game and another, using the stars collected, you can also enhance these bonuses, improving their effectiveness. The graphics are an element of great importance in a production of this kind, and in the case of Chocohero it does not disappoint at all. The developers have in fact managed to draw characters that are really fun to see, with big eyes and indefinable expressions, who move around in a world full of colors and with an effective style.
