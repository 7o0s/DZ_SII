{"name": "Battlelands Royale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlelands-royale-la-recensione.html", "text": "Without even making a great imaginative effort, Battlelands Royale says it all starting from the title, quite explicit in terms of reference genre and inspiration. Well yes, it's just another battle royale, even if in this case created specifically for mobile platforms and therefore characterized by a particular style, not transplanted directly from some famous game on domestic platforms. Battle royale on mobile devices are now a prevailing trend, and it would not be too surprising if most of the users of the genre were moving en masse to these platforms, also given the mechanics which are particularly suitable for use on the move. To be able to adapt them to the best, however, some precautions are needed and a game designed specifically for these devices certainly has an edge in this sense. Battlelands Royale manages to capture the core elements of the battle royale canon but making them more fluid and dynamic, built on a control system and interface that are purpose-built for the touchscreen, and you feel the difference right in the middle of the game. The mechanics are the usual ones: you are launched from above into a large map with the explorable area gradually shrinking. In the meantime we have to collect weapons, ammunition and defenses and prepare ourselves for clashes with other players, which with the constant reduction of the practicable area are starting to become more and more frequent. The last one standing has won. In short, it is the original concept of Playerunknown's Battlegrounds, therefore stripped of those crafting elements that made Fortnite famous but for this very reason particularly fast and intuitive even for shorter and more frequent games. Obviously it is a free-to-play, therefore we must expect the micro-transactions, in this case focused on the presence of the ~Battle Bucks~, but these mainly serve to change the appearance of the main character and do not affect the game balancing. Portable battle royale The action is framed from above with a sort of isometric perspective, which already changes the situation a little compared to the classic third person behind the back of the protagonist, because it allows a broad view of the surrounding map but with less depth of field because it is not possible to see what is hidden beyond the few meters visible around the character. However, it seems a setting destined to get more and more attention in this genre, as also demonstrated by the recently announced game on Cyanide and Happiness, set up in exactly the same way. The controls are entrusted to two virtual sticks on the touch screen that allow movement and fire in a very similar way to the classic twin-stick shooter, but the response to the commands is almost perfect and the virtual sticks, for once, work really well . The fact of eliminating a large part of the complex key interfaces that usually appear in porting from PC and console games, given the need to replicate the more complex controls, is a winner. Once landed on the map, all we have to do is find weapons, ammunition and shields to collect by simply passing over them, with the clashes taking place exactly as you would expect in a twin-stick shooter. The diversity of weapons is essential for setting the approach to the fight: there are long and short range rifles, more powerful or with a higher rate, but only one can be used at a time. The problem is that the amount of weapon models at the moment is still quite low, and given the graphic setting, among other things, they are not even easily distinguishable at first glance. Then there is probably a need for some balancing because some weapons, such as the assault rifle, seem simpler to use and more effective than others. Having to deal with a not very extensive map and with more frequent reductions imposes a much faster pace of play that associates well with the mobile environment, even if the matches tend to last even too little. The graphic style chosen, with its cartoonish and caricatured setting, represents a good ironic reinterpretation of games of this type that associates well with the facetious spirit of Battlelands Royale.", "date": "2018-07-06", "grade": "7.8"}
