{"name": "Lunga Vita al re!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/109717-new-little-kings-story-lunga-vita-al-re.html", "text": "Although the timid debut of Little King's Story on Wii was among the causes that forced Cing to leave the cabin and puppets, the game is still remembered as one of the best and unexpected third-party surprises on the Nintendo console, as well as the only title in able to at least partially satisfy those who have been waiting for a new Pikmin chapter for years. New Little King's Story is unfortunately not the sequel that the talented couple Yoshiro Kimura and Yasuhiro Wada would have liked to make, but rather Marvelous's attempt to give a second chance to a promising IP orphaned by its original authors. Entrusted to the AQL division (Fate/Extra CCC) and published on PlayStation Vita in collaboration with Konami, however, this new chapter is not even a simple remake, given the more or less evident innovations that go alongside the characters, mechanics and settings of the original game. The choice to re-propose the little king in an exclusive PlayStation Vita certainly appears strange and courageous, a console certainly not known for reigning over an empire full of subjects. Little rulers grow up The first big difference between the old and the new Little King's Story undoubtedly concerns the plot, this time with more serious premises and in line with Vita's ideal audience. If the protagonist of the original was a chubby and curious child who began to give orders left and right after finding a crown on the street, this time Korobo is a king in all respects, complete with a Royal Guard and ministers in tow. The story opens with a sudden attack that razes the royal castle to the ground, forcing the young ruler and his handful of advisers to rebuild the kingdom of Alpoko starting from a run-down hovel and a wooden chair as a throne. It is a plot that is clearly more attractive to those who do not digest fairy tales and childish characters, but it is not necessarily a lucky choice, given that a sui generis plot full of personality is now giving way to one that is so canonical as to be almost banal. Apart from a few new entries and a few replacements, the cast of characters has instead remained almost unchanged: the king is accompanied on his adventure by some ministers, while between a secondary mission and a fight with a boss you come across a series of princesses from rescue and bring back to your own castle. Some novelties concern the young nobles, we will see it in a while, but fortunately Marvelous AQL has left intact that successful mix of RPG, strategy and city simulation that seemed to unite Pikmin with The Settlers. In the role of Korobo, the player can wander around the kingdom and hire his subjects: just approach, press a key, and the slacker begins to follow his king as if he were his shadow; just press another and it launches a charge towards an enemy or an object to interact with. Five, twelve, twenty-three... you will soon have a real battalion ready to follow your orders, but the most interesting aspect is represented by the game's job system. Depending on the structures built in your village, it is possible to assign each of your followers a particular job, thus giving them useful skills in battle or in the collection of resources: a hunter can shoot arrows at otherwise unreachable enemies, a carpenter builds bridges or stairways , a farmer is able to unearth treasures by digging into the ground, and so on, up to unlocking veteran soldiers, cooks, merchants and even TV presenters. The enormous variety and usefulness of the classes makes it essential to carefully manage the party and organize it according to one's needs, but above all it becomes necessary to anticipate every unexpected event; an army of soldiers only allows you to pulverize a boss in a short time, but if the road is blocked by a huge boulder the only solution is to go back to the village to recover a miner. Precisely with regard to the management of the subjects, one of the most welcome additions of New Little King's Story concerns the possibility of customizing and training them, enhancing them through a fairly simple growth system and changing their equipment, so as to avoid the ~clone war~ effect ~ of the first Little King's Story. Playstation 3 trophies Marvelous has not wasted in designing original Trophies, since the vast majority are unlocked by eliminating the bosses and completing the side missions. On the other hand it is a fairly easy Platinum. Between old and new In short, New Little King's Story maintains some important stakes of the Wii version. The world map remained the same, while the castle, expandablethroughout the adventure, it still serves as a hub in which to activate new missions, buy new structures, organize your units and interact with the rescued princesses. In this chapter for Vita, more importance has been given to the beautiful maidens, and now, in addition to assigning the player special missions, they can take part in the battle by helping Korobo and the Royal Guard with a particular support skill. There is still the possibility of carrying on love stories with each princess, but much more interesting for gameplay purposes is the relationship system of one's subjects: from time to time some members of one's party may fall in love, and taking them to the sanctuary they will marry and have children. In turn, the children of the kingdom have the unique ability to climb trees to reach treasures inaccessible to any other unit. The finishing work of the game involved everything, including structures, units and missions: building a hospital allows you to have all the KO units hospitalized in one place, with the possibility of having them treated instantly by paying a certain amount of money . The new development team has even gone so far as to add a crafting system, which however proves to be useful almost exclusively for those who want to be a little more competitive in the new online challenges, timed or point-based missions in which to compete to climb the game's leaderboards . This is also because, in general, the level of difficulty has been rounded off a lot, with some boss battles made more accessible but at the same time less epic. A special mention should be made to the soundtrack, which like the original is entirely based on arrangements of classical works, including the Nutcracker March or Giuseppe Verdi's Aida: the overall effect is absolutely pleasant, but unfortunately even in this case we are facing a step backwards, since most of the original songs adapted splendidly by Yutaka Minobe and Yoko Shimomura have been replaced by music that is spot on but less brilliant. A neglected kingdom Marvelous's plan to make the experience attractive to a more mature target was not limited to the narrative component, but also and above all to the aesthetic aspect and characterization of the characters, both the main ones and the supporting characters. Korobo is no longer a funny chubby boy, just as the seven princesses are made much more attractive by an artistic style more in line with traditional manga: those with a more ~bold~ design have been completely replaced (such as the chubby Spumoni or the too prosperous Ferne), but here too the speech made for the changes to the plot is valid, with the game that loses a lot of personality in an attempt to pursue a more traditional and less particular aesthetic. New Little King's Story would have been a far better work if the developers had spent less time making the game sexier and more time patching up the flaws. Especially in light of the power of the Vita's hardware and the game's low-poly graphics, it's astonishing how the engine can't handle the nearby artificial intelligence, with heavy slowdowns already in the first few minutes of the game, when the village is made up of only a few commoners, as it collapses devastatingly and loses frames along the way in the second half of the adventure, with the outposts full of subjects and the king carrying thirty units with him in single file. Let's be clear, during the less crowded missions and in the boss battles the problem is much less evident, but what is the point of enriching and expanding one's kingdom if a walk inside it turns into a frustrating funeral procession? Other more or less important defects range from a difficult to navigate map to an inaccurate pointing system, from an occasionally spiteful camera to the inability to explain many elements of the gameplay well to the player, while the greatness of the texts is incomprehensible, so small enough to be almost illegible in some cases. Unfortunately, more than a semester after its release in Japan, the arrival of a patch that could correct the main flaws of New Little King's Story now seems unlikely, flaws that in addition to ruining a delightful experience would undoubtedly have been avoidable with a more careful and less hasty development.", "date": "2012-10-15", "grade": "6.9"}
