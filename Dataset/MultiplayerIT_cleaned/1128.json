{"name": "Gli Incredibili: Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gli-incredibili-recensione.html", "text": "After having amazed and made millions of viewers dream last Christmas with Finding Nemo, Pixar is back in the field and is preparing to break the box office with their latest animated film: The Incredibles. The competition appears fiercer than ever, being able to count on already announced successes such as Shrek 2 and Polar Express, but the Disney film will certainly be able to play its cards skilfully. Just to introduce the cartoon to the general gaming public, the playable version for all three next generation consoles has come out these days and we certainly couldn't help but try it thoroughly and express our opinion. A normal family of Super Heroes In this new Pixar production the first thing that catches the eye is the fact that the protagonists are human beings, not so much normal, but humans nonetheless. We will find ourselves guiding Bob Parr and members of his super-family throughout the game. Each component of the same has particular super powers which, if used in the right way, allow you to advance in the game and to defeat the hordes of enemies that we will face. We have decided in this article of ours to carefully avoid talking about the plot of the title published by THQ also because, unfortunately, it is the same as the forthcoming film and we don't want to spoil the surprise for anyone. As usual when it comes to games taken from their Hollywood counterparts, we will find ourselves checking if the good things done by the writers and animators of Pixar, regarding the film, will be transported to our consoles. The Incredibles is presented as a classic three-dimensional platformer that places the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other and to present it to you in the best possible way we believe that the best thing is to introduce you to the protagonists. Mr Incredible, or Bob Parr, is the typical super hero with herculean strength and capable of knocking down several enemies with one blow. He can lift large loads to clear his way or even to throw the weight on the unfortunate ... and if there is no large tool to use as a weapon, what's better than using your enemies as javelins? Yes, you read right, Mr. Incredible is pure power. The Incredibles is presented as a classic three-dimensional platformer that places the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other A normal family of Super Heroes Mrs Icredible or rather Elastigirl as well as being the wife of the aforementioned super hero is also a heroine with uncommon elastic qualities and capable of grabbing enemies and hurling them into orbit. Violetta and Flash are the couple's two children, could they be born without powers? Obviously not. Violet has the gift of invisibility while Flash, as you can imagine from the name, runs at the speed of light. All the characteristics of the protagonists are exploited in the different levels in which the game is articulated and so Mr. Incredible will have to face dozens of opponents, opening his way with punches while Violetta will sneak out from behind taking advantage of her invisibility. Flash instead will be used in very fast races on crowded roads or forests full of obstacles. So when you play as Flash, races against time will be the order of the day, while when you play as Mr. Incredible, the game will turn into a real classic platformer where the only goal is to find the right direction, eliminating every obstacle on the road. own path. It will also be possible to use some of the opponents' weapons and also different means of transport that will modify the game making it more similar to a racing game with a somewhat light-hearted and irreverent setting. The three versions compared The Xbox version of The Incredibles is the only one with support for online play by exploiting two possibilities: live aware and content download. In this regard, the Robot Battle Arena is already available which will allow you to fight in an arena against countless opponents led by the AI, which is too naive, of the THQ title. As far as the technical sector is concerned, the versions we tested are practically identical with the small differences in terms of texture sharpness dictated by the greater capabilities of the Microsoft machine. Geronimooo! Up to here we have limited ourselves to presenting the THQ and Disney Interactive game to you without emphasizing any shortcomings of the same. Unfortunately these defects are present and affect the enjoyment of the product, certainly the euphoria you feel at the beginning of the title when you experience super powers is something to underline, but unfortunately once that ~push~ given by the novelty was exhausted we were unable to find it throughout the game. The controls are unfortunately not muchprecise and indeed sometimes they are too cumbersome as in the control of the combos of Mr Incredible and Elastigirl. During the missions with the small and very fast Flash, however, the problem will be that of having to totally memorize the track on which the race takes place since our mini hero can never stop to analyze the situation. The camera is also often imprecise, even if it is possible to fix it and center it by pressing the white button or with the right analog stick. The lock-on-like function implemented by the developers is insufficient, because once an enemy is framed, it is enough to bend down to pick up an object that the camera loses orientation. As for the cut-scenes taken directly from the film, nothing to say, really well done and hilarious as well as the dubbing completely in Italian. The graphics engine is quite good and travels with a constant frame rate by painting an animated world very similar to what we will see in cinemas in a few days. The characters are very accurate even if the animations are not always very fluid. The general challenge level of the THQ game is quite low, excellent for younger players who, however, will find themselves in difficulty against certain bosses who will instead require the malice of expert gamers to be defeated. Comment In conclusion, we can only half save this latest Disney production in the videogame field: the positive aspects drawn with both hands from a good script and very nice and captivating characters are contrasted, in fact, with an unbalanced and a little frustrating gameplay which will risk boring users much sooner than expected. If the goal was to capture the attention of any group of gamers, this was missed and The Icredibles is a title suitable above all for novice players, fascinated by the protagonists of the film and their super powers. If you have a little brother, this could be the right Christmas present. Pros Captivating and nice characters Italian voice acting The super powers... Cons ...sometimes difficult to manage Technically only fair Unbalanced gameplay Cross-platform Xbox, Ps2 and Gamecube review.", "date": "2004-11-25", "grade": null}
