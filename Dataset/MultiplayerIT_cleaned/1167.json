HHR has also undergone another involution compared to the past, the ~stealth~ part has been really reduced to the bone, and the structure of the game is now limited to a pure third-person action game. The very few passages worthy of a stealth game can be counted on the fingertips and with not exactly noteworthy results. HeadHunter: Redemption features many secrets and bonuses, which can be unlocked by thoroughly exploring the various levels and recovering certain items. The difficulty level is above average, also thanks to the character control system which in certain situations certainly does not make the player's life easier. The programmers have also committed some small lightness, in balancing medikits and ammunition refills, practically making you play with a minimum energy recharge during the levels, but almost infinite ammunition. On the other hand, the scanning system of the surrounding area, implemented in the sunglasses of the characters, is interesting. Called IRIS, this device will provide valuable aids to the player, both in the form of information on the surrounding area, and as regards the weak points of the end-of-level bosses. During the game there will be numerous cutscenes, of good quality, which will explain many things, both about the past of the characters, and as regards the plot of the game, which honestly has been well articulated. The camera is controlled manually using the right stick and this offers a clear and complete view of the entire playing area. The game action is all too linear, the puzzles to be solved are extremely trivial and only the battles with the bosses at the end of the level are really interesting. Against them it will be necessary to change the attack strategy to be able to kill them, which practically never happens during the rest of the adventure Technically speaking... As far as the technical aspects of the game are concerned, it is immediately noticeable how HHR does not prove to be up to a title from the end of 2004, especially on Xbox, where the graphic standards are quite high. The HHr engine does not have particular strengths, the animations of the characters are in fact woody, the amount of polygons in the models and settings is not high and the textures are just discrete. However, the design of some settings is quite accurate, unfortunately the colors and patterns used in the textures are cyclically repeated in the levels, always bringing a feeling of dejavu. The lighting effects are good, even if on certain occasions, often in surface areas, they are also annoying for the player, in particular there is an abuse of motion blur, used to make everything too blurred. The sound department has managed much better, the in-game effects are good and the audio dubbing, especially for the character of Jack, is adequate for the character design. The real note of merit belongs to the truly high quality orchestral music, arranged by Richard Jaques. Comment The sequel to HeadHunter proves to be a disappointment, especially for those who awaited it anxiously, after the first appearance of Jack. Unfortunately, the developers have decided to transform it into the most classic of action games, without being able to implement a ~something~ that contributes to making the game exciting during the course of the levels. HeadHunter: Redemption does not excel in any field, except for the creation of the music, and for the story-related background. The longevity, due more than to the intelligence of the enemies, to the difficulty in overcoming some levels, is quite high for a third person action game, and this will be an incentive for some players, but an insurmountable barrier for those who have not loved the first chapter. Jack Wade fans can still try to check him out. Pros: Atmosphere and Plot IRIS System Music Cons: Graphical Appearance Minimal Stealth Component> Too linear The first HeadHunter, originally released on the Dreamcast, aroused many positive reviews, both from the press and from players. After his fleeting appearance in a port on PlayStation 2, Sega brings back the stainless Jack Wade in a new adventure. HeadHunter: Redemption is set about 20 years after the end of the first chapter and many things have changed in the world as we know it... After a terrible epidemic, caused by the Bloody Mary virus, created by Doctor Zewinber, even an earthquake with devastating has hit the American soil. Right now there are divided cities divided between those who live above the surface of the planet or below, in a clear reference to Cyber Punk science fiction and certain post-atomic Holywoodian films. Jack has aged, but quethis is not the only novelty, in fact during the game we will also control another character, the more flashy Leeza X, an ex-criminal who was saved and raised by Jack. During the development of the levels, we will have an alternation in the control of the two protagonists, unfortunately Jack and Leeza have not been characterized in the best way. In fact, there will be no differences in using one or the other character, a factor that could have significantly affected the game mechanics. Another big difference, compared to the past, lies in the elimination of the motorbike sections, a decision that will make many fans of the first HeadHunter turn up their noses.", "date": "2004-10-25", "grade": null}
