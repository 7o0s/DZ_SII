The all-Japanese cartoon style may not be liked, but the enormous care taken in the creation of each single animation frame is objectively undeniable, which makes the fights a real feast for the eyes. And then there's one of the most technical and accessible layered combat systems ever made. Characteristics that, unfortunately, over the years portable conversions have never managed to reproduce satisfactorily, ever since the porting of its first franchise, Guilty Gear, due to limited handheld capabilities and questionable analog control systems. Problems that Arc System Works has finally managed to ignore thanks to the computing power of PlayStation Vita and the quality of the analog sticks and its ergonomics, offering us a conversion of the most recent episode of BlazBlue, if possible, even better than the home counterparts for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Powered life Forget the missing frames, the static backdrops and the obscene slowdowns that characterized the Nintendo 3DS and PSP conversions: in this version of BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend the Arc System Works developers have managed to preserve every single frame, light effect or polygon in the background without ever sacrificing the granite 60 frames per second, not even when running the Distortion Drives that caused so many problems in previous portable conversions. In addition, the sprites drawn natively at 720p are necessarily improved by the lower resolution of the PlayStation Vita screen, which therefore gives us absolutely sharp and precise images, further embellished by OLED technology and therefore by greater brightness and vivacity of colors. In short, a real panacea, especially for a game with an all-Japanese cartoonish imprint like this: the fights give the illusion of an interactive anime, and it couldn't be otherwise given that the entire franchise revolves around a very complex story and a a stack of well-characterized characters. While often bordering on absolute nonsense, the intricate plot of BlazBlue deserves attention precisely because of the amount of details and situations devised despite its nature as a ~simple~ fighting game: in this case a fictionalized summary of the prequel Calamity Trigger has been added, as well to the individual storylines of the nineteen fighters, including new ones for the DLC characters inherited from the ~prequel~ Continuum Shift II, which further evolve the story between fights through fully voiced dialogue. The sono sector is in fact another strong point of the cartridge, especially if you have a good pair of headphones, thanks above all to a rock soundtrack of exceptional quality and variety. The English dubbing is rather modest, but purists can easily select the excellent original Japanese audio thanks to the appropriate option. I'll break your life BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend has always been a unique fighting game of its kind, capable of engaging novice players thanks to a simple and immediate control system. In reality, the fights hide an enormous depth capable of giving enormous satisfaction to the most experienced fans of the genre. This conversion does not contradict itself and, on the contrary, makes the approach even more enjoyable thanks to the quality of the analog stick: we are naturally far from the precision offered by real arcade-sticks, yet this porting for Vita didn't give us the slightest problem even in the execution of the most complicated special moves. For the uninitiated, to the three keys traditionally associated with the light, medium and strong blow, one is added dedicated to the so-called Drive attack: it is basically a special power that makes each character unique in its kind. And so, the old Valkenhayn can temporarily transform into a very fast werewolf while Rachel can direct the gusts of wind, the massive Tager can magnetize enemies to attract them like a magnet while little Carl can control his disturbing puppet, and so on. The roster can therefore also include ~only~ nineteen characters, but in reality the difference between each of them is such that there is absolutely no need for further additions: learning to master each of them perfectly can really take many hours. It is also important to underline that this PlayStation Vita version also includes all the characters previously released in DLC form, to which is added the new entry Relius Clover, father of Carl and, if possible, still pdeadliest puppeteer. Each character is equipped with a generous repertoire of special moves which also includes the canonical super moves, here called Distortion Drive, and a devastating and spectacular special technique called Astral Heat, capable of immediately ending the fight. The most powerful shots naturally take advantage of a special bar, also consumed by some particular defensive maneuvers which therefore require a minimum of strategy: in short, there is something for all tastes and, from this point of view, the repertoire of modalities does not disappoint either of game. PSVita trophies BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend offers 38 bronze, 10 silver, 3 gold and platinum trophies. To earn them you have to work hard, completing each mode and unlocking everything, but not only: some require the execution of particular combos or strategies during fights with different characters. A thousand ways to fight In addition to the aforementioned story mode, which offers a ton of narrative sequences and even various multiple endings for each character, BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend is full of alternatives, especially for the solo experience. The very difficult Unlimited Mars mode, for example, allows you to face ten enhanced version characters in sequence to accumulate as many points as possible, which can of course be shared online; even the unpublished Abyss is a sort of survival mode, with a small variation: the player can in fact buy temporary and non-temporary bonuses to enhance his character and face the strongest enemies on an equal footing, however, if he is defeated, all the accumulated points are lost and the only way to get them back is to start the mode over and go back to the fight you lost earlier. The Abyss mode is therefore a curious RPG hybrid that offers a valid alternative to the traditional Arcade mode, which is also present. The tutorial mode for newbies, the inevitable Training Mode and a brand new Challenge Mode that rewards players for performing specific combos complete the circle. Each milestone achieved in the various modes unlocks illustrations, movies, music and more, which can be viewed in the appropriate menus. The Versus mode deserves a last mention, obviously available both locally and online: in the latter case, the netcode seemed decidedly superior to that proposed by Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 as well as the available options, although still limited to few parameters and the creation of a room where you can wait your turn to fight other players. In short, from this point of view, the care placed in the single-player mode is much greater.", "date": "2012-04-24", "grade": "9.0"}
