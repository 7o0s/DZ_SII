Over the years LEGO has not remained idle to observe the arrival of video games, but has quickly been able to carve out its own well-defined niche, made up of well-exploited licenses and games for the little ones that wink at the adults. Minifigures Online is part of this vast catalog of titles and features characters from all LEGO worlds, from the Black Knight to the astronaut, from the hot-dog man to the ninja, mixed in what we could summarily define as a mobile Diablo for children. We tried LEGO Minifigures Online, fun and absurd as a sofa bunk Better a pirate or the hot dog man? The best thing about this title is that it abandoned its free-to-play approach some time ago to move to a simpler economic system: you buy the main game and possibly the additional modules, without any other costs. On the App Store, the game therefore costs 4.99 and includes only the World of Pirates, while the additional worlds are available via in-app purchase for 2.99 each. On Android, the same version available on the App Store (therefore including the world of pirates) costs 5.50. For the moment the additional worlds are dedicated to space adventures and the Middle Ages, in the future Funcom has promised that there will be others, we wouldn't mind something related to the film, after all... ~Everything is awesome~! The fulcrum of the game is obviously the possibility of unlocking hundreds of different minifigures, each with its own set of special powers which sometimes, of course, are nothing more than a copy of those already possessed by the characters already in the roster and which can be area damage, very powerful hits or stun effects on enemies. Of the total minifigures, about 40 can be obtained simply by proceeding along the various levels of the game, while the rest can be obtained by completing achievements, replaying levels or collecting the various parts that compose them. Once we have the character of our dreams we can insert it into our magical trio. In fact, the game provides for choosing three Lego minifigures with which to face the missions, which can be changed on the fly, as if they were a sui generis RPG party. When one of the three minifigures runs out of energy, he will have to rest for a while before returning to action, or we will have to spend the game currency. Obviously, being a game with an MMO vocation, we will also be able to play cooperatively with our friends. The game itself is clearly aimed at a young audience, this can be understood from the fact that the chat is full of censorships, to prevent bad words or important numbers from being posted and is full of textual references to any parents who supervise their child while playing , however, this does not prevent it from being pleasant and fun even for players who have now grown a beard. In the end we are still talking about a Diablo-like mechanic, only that instead of area spells we have a character dressed as a bee who slows down enemies with honey and throws bees at them. In theory it's a horrible death, but in the world of Lego it's almost laughable. Our heroes fall into three categories: defender, striker and builder. The former are obviously more inclined to take hits, the latter could be defined as the damage dealers and the third are simply faster than the others in assembling the lego pieces scattered around the map which can become fundamental structures for continuing, a bit like in Traveller's Tales titles. Each unit can have melee or ranged attacks and is usually linked to an element of nature, which allows it to enter certain areas or take advantage of particular bonuses, Skylanders style. All very simple, except the controls Being a sort of MMO, there are also weapon updates and levels, as well as dungeons, to be tackled alone or with friends. To improve weapons, just spend a certain number of stars, which can be collected by destroying every possible object on the screen or by eliminating enemies. And in true MMO tradition, each dungeon requires a certain level to enter. Within these areas you will obviously find the best bosses and rewards, obviously don't expect a World of Warcraft-style challenge, these instances are nothing more than small levels with some harder units inside to swallow. The MMO concept of LEGO Minifigure Online is in fact very simple: don't waitevi guilds, very articulated quests, crafting or other advanced components, it is a question of sharing some common hubs with other players or possibly facing them and missions in the instances or the main one, nothing more, nothing less. The game mechanics are also elementary, basically we are asked to destroy everything in front of us, be it a banana-throwing monkey, a soldier armed with an arquebus or any other object. The funniest part of the game is undoubtedly seeing a Roman centurion fight alongside a dude dressed as a unicorn while a plumber beats up a bunch of skeletons with a plunger. There is a lot of LEGO nonsense humor within this game, you can tell when we have to free a pizza delivery boy because he is the only one who can enter a British colonial stronghold, one of those things that can make sense only in a world made of bricks. The only drawback that spoils the experience in the mobile version is probably the control system, which while relying on the usual virtual pads with the left thumb used for movements and the right one for attacks and character changes, does not seem particularly responsive , indeed it will often send conflicting signals to our character, making him suddenly change direction. Fortunately, the level of challenge of the game is such that it is not an insurmountable problem, but sometimes it can be annoying.", "date": "2015-07-08", "grade": "7.8"}
