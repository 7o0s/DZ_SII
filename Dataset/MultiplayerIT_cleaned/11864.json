{"name": "The Sims 2: World Adventure - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-2-world-adventure-recensione.html", "text": "Hunting for treasures As for the new actions, in addition to taking souvenir photos, it is possible to venture both for the local cuisine and for the culture of the place, interacting with the locals, learning dances, legends, greetings and much more. Of course, once learned, these customs can be passed on to friends. One of the most intriguing possibilities in World Adventure is the possibility of buying souvenirs and finding hidden objects, generally buried under the sand. Once the holiday is over, based on the value of the objects collected, it will be possible to rate the Sim as a tourist through the ~Holiday moment~ panel. For those who have sufficient amounts of money, it will also be possible to buy their own home in one of the available locations, furnishing it according to one's tastes. On the technical front, no improvements have been made and therefore those who have a PC capable of running The Sims 2 will not have any problems with this expansion either. On the test PC, the game runs at full resolution and detail.

Pros Tried-and-tested gameplay Several new actions Cons No graphical improvements Tastes too much already It has now been 3 years since The Sims 2 arrived in stores, and as already happened for the first episode, the Maxis home life simulator is benefiting from a large number of expansions and stuff packs (mini-expansions containing mostly objects). World Adventure is the sixth expansion for The Sims 2 and repeats in some respects what has already been seen in The Sims: Vacation, one of the many add-ons for the first episode. Once the game is installed (which requires the basic title to work), it will be possible to select one of the families already present, or create one from scratch, to be developed as you see fit or to leave for a holiday in one of the three tourist resorts available. The three destinations represent the classic types of holidays, namely sea, mountains and the Orient. Each of these features a large number of things to do and places to go to best suit the Sims. On Twikkii Island, for example, it will be possible to sunbathe, build sand castles, take part in excursions or learn about local customs and traditions, while in Tre Laghi, life in the open air and lots of fun will dominate. However, from time to time it will be possible to carve out your own holiday according to your needs, choosing not only the duration, even whether to go as a couple or to bring the whole family with you, perhaps adding a few friends.", "date": "2007-11-05", "grade": null}
