{"name": "Off Road - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/off-road-recensione.html", "text": "Out for PlayStation 2, Wii and PC, Off Road leaves you dumbfounded for more than one reason. Accustomed to the various Gran Turismo, Project Gotham Racing, Burnout and the like which, each in its own way, have rewritten the canons of arcade driving video games, it annoys to be faced with a product so poor in options and so superficial in many aspects. But starting it on PC also produces another effect, namely the impression of being back in 2001 or so. Now, graphics aren't everything, but in 2008, accustomed to the standards of the latest generation consoles, it's a bit strange to see such a technically antiquated game running on PC. In short, go and take a look at the images attached to the article and compare them with the images of Colin McRae Rally Dirt, Trackmania United Forever, Need For Speed ProStreet or the latest Sega Rally. In reality, even comparing them with any Gran Turismo released for PS2 allows us to understand that we really aren't there: bare scenarios, angular routes, squared and not very detailed car models, environmental effects absent or scarce, if not bad (just look at the water raised by vehicles when passing through a river or any puddle). We realize that it is not nice to start a review by talking about the technical aspects, but let's say that in this case it is precisely the obsolescence that shines through from every pixel that determines a rather negative first impression. The soundtrack also doesn't help, with ugly songs that trigger the game every time the next track is loaded and limited and uninvolving sound effects. A slow career Off Road is an arcade driving game licensed by Ford and Land Rover which, as the title suggests, will put us at the wheel of the two American manufacturers' off-road vehicles. There are five game modes offered in total: Gara Veloce, which immediately puts you behind the wheel of a car, on a circuit, without requiring configurations of any kind; Career, the main mode that we will talk about at length during the review; Tournament, i.e. a series of connected races with a final score; Arcade, the classic mode consisting of a series of races to be overcome in sequence by fighting against time; Multiplayer finally offers the possibility to challenge another human player on the same computer. There is no online game mode. it is the obsolescence that transpires from every pixel that determines a rather negative first impression A slow career Obviously the heart of the game is the Career mode, which requires you to win several races, in order to advance on a long map with the various competitions available illustrated above, and in order to earn money to buy ever more powerful vehicles. Unfortunately, the work done by the developers was not the best on the contrary. What immediately catches the eye is the total lack of the ability to customize your fleet. The only options available are the showroom to buy them and the garage to look at and repair them. There is no tuning whatsoever to be done, sadly. In short, the career mode boils down to: enter a race, win to unlock the course and the next vehicle, buy a more powerful vehicle and repeat until the end. The yellow meter But let's finally get into the game. As already mentioned, the general setting is completely arcade, in the sense that the driving model is extremely simplified and the only skill required of the player is to run like crazy and brake before tackling the curves. The only other factor to take into consideration is the damage, which deserves a separate digression (which we do immediately to remove the diseased tooth). On the packaging it says ~Repairs in real time of the vehicle~, cryptic phrase that can mean many things. In this case it indicates a yellow meter, which increases by making accidents and which decreases by collecting the blue rotating toolboxes scattered around the circuit. Unfortunately, the vehicles are not deformed in the slightest by the various accidents (only the textures change and, in the event of high damage, clouds of black smoke come out of the engine, but you hardly notice them) which, moreover, work in a rather anomalous way. In fact, someone should explain to us how it is possible that a head-on at 230 km/h against a mountain does less damage than a 50 km/h car. This means that it is more penalizing to rub an opponent while overtaking than to overturn the car by hitting a rock. But let's illustrate this anomaly better: during some head-to-head, where touching other cars is almost inevitable, you risk suffering a large amount of damage without having had any accident worthy of note. In modern games we are now used to seeing jumpbranches for such facts, certainly not to have entire matches compromised for having touched the opponents. Earth, snow, water There are other things to explain about the driving model. As already mentioned, it is an extremely simplified system. This wouldn't be a flaw in itself, if it weren't really oversimplified. Even a random Flatout, for example, is very easy to control, but there the developers have included many variations that still make it interesting to play. This does not happen in Off Road and the three types of terrain (dirt, wet and snowy) in which the 12 circuits are divided (24 is written on the package, but in reality they are 12 circuits that can be traveled in both directions) are indifferent for the driving pattern of the cars which remains the same in all cases. The only variations are due to the different vehicles which, increasingly powerful as the career progresses, require longer braking to take corners. Even the bumps are not influential, given that the only real obstacles are the rocks, capable of blocking vehicles even if they are very small. The trees and bushes, on the other hand, it is as if they did not exist since one passes through them like ghosts. Among the other defects, the poor longevity of the career mode should also be noted, which takes a couple of afternoons to complete and which does not offer any incentive to be resumed later. But is there any merit? In reality, some interesting elements are present, despite the general picture which is anything but positive. The first is that the system requirements are low and it is possible to run it on any computer released in the last 6/7 years, even if the amount of RAM required is not explained, especially on Windows Vista; what is 1 GB for a game that installs just 500 MB of data on the hard disk? the three types of terrain are indifferent to the driving model of the cars which remains identical in all cases But is there any merit? More interesting, however, are some of the races in the career mode. In addition to the more classic races (time trials, overtaking tests, checkpoint races, duels, elimination races and so on), however well done, the developers have included slalom races, in which you have to pass through pairs of flags trying to miss as few as possible; timed races in which you have to collect green hourglasses scattered along the way (which give extra time) while carefully avoiding the red ones (which take it away); the gold rushes, in which you have to collect a certain number of coins scattered around the circuit, also trying to overcome all your opponents and, finally, the exploration races in which you have to collect hidden artifacts within a certain time limit and laps . Too bad that the defects listed in the rest of the article nullify the attraction of these little pearls of originality, which are still able to give you a few minutes of fun. Comment What's left to say? In some respects Off Road is bleak. The budget price doesn't justify its being antiquated and inadequate for an average 2008 production. Other budget games, like Crashday, are much better for the same price. We honestly don't know who might be interested, apart from the die-hard fans of Ford or Land Rover. Pros Some modes are fun It's cheap Runs on any PC released in the last 6/7 years Cons The guide system is extremely simplified.
