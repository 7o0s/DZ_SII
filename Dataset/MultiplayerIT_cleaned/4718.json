And this is undoubtedly one of those cases in which we can talk about small barrels and good wine, since Silly Walks has personalities and ideas that many mobile games produced by large teams don't even see with binoculars... Hells Kitchen Well aware of the fact that in mobile gaming the narrative sector is really of interest to few, Part Time Monkey has wisely decided to save time and effort by cutting this aspect completely, without the product being affected in any way. The player takes on the role of one of the cute anthropomorphic food protagonists (it starts with the pineapple that stands out on the application icon but going forward it is possible to unlock donuts, slices of pizza, bags of popcorn, pancakes, hamburgers and so on talking) and his task is to reach the goal of the stages made available unscathed and thus save the poor fruits held captive in cages. Silly Walks is already starting off on the right foot, not only for the bizarre setting just described but above all thanks to an adorable cosmetics to say the least, composed of characters brilliantly inspired by everyday objects and colorful home scenarios that bring to mind the delightful nonsense of Katamary Damacy. The real strength of the title, however, is constituted by a gameplay that rests entirely on the bizarre but curiously effective control system developed by Erikoinen. Basically, the protagonist on the screen automatically rotates on his foot, while the other remains suspended in mid-air; performing a tap, the latter is grounded by turning the character in the opposite direction. To advance it is therefore necessary to make quick rhythmic touches to ensure that the legs and rotations alternate with the right timing to go in the desired direction. The level design obviously puts its effort into making this process as challenging as possible: the paths that must be tackled to get to the end of the stages are therefore characterized by narrow lanes, rapid changes of angle and obstacles of various types, and come into contact with one of these or ending up smashed on the floor causes an immediate game over which forces you to start over or restart from the point of death by paying a pledge of sugar cubes (the Silly Walks in-game currency that is scraped together during games or by reaching certain objectives but which can also be exchanged for real money) or by consenting to the viewing of an advertisement. Fortunately, Part Time Monkey has opted not to follow the easy path of wild monetization, making its product completely usable even for free and limiting in-app purchases to basically accessory elements. The Finnish developer was also good at marking the succession of levels with small progressive additions that help revive an otherwise rather monotonous structure. After the first stage interlocutors, the motor faculties of the protagonists are integrated with a click that can be activated with a swipe upwards, and from time to time trivial but pleasant environmental puzzles and even clashes with unlikely bosses peep out. All things that are not enough to make Silly Walks an eternal title or one destined to leave an indelible mark in the history of mobile gaming, but which denote an uncommon attention to detail in the field of free to play.", "date": "2017-08-18", "grade": "8.5"}
