With its cartoonish and epic style at the same time, the fast-paced fights and the environmental puzzles worthy of a The Legend of Zelda, both the first and the second Darksiders have made inroads into the hearts of hundreds of thousands of fans... ruthlessly smashing them when the publisher THQ went bankrupt and took Vigil Games and all of its third parties with it. It really seemed that the saga would not have found an epilogue but then, when all hope seemed lost, Nordic Games took over what remained of Vigil Games and decided to invest again in the franchise. In this sense, the Deathinitive Edition of Darksiders II, in addition to having the ugliest subtitle of all time, is a real experiment: should it have the desired success, it would turn on the longed-for green light for the development of the third chapter of the saga . That's why the new publisher has decided to convert it for the new generation consoles - and for PC, later - by including the game and all the originally released DLCs in a single package, even quite cheap. A courageous but also rather controversial operation. The Deathinitive Edition of Darksiders II is a modest conversion but also the last hope of the brand Weekend with the dead If you've read our old review of Darksiders II, you'll know that Death's adventure, while not perfect, we really liked it thanks to an extraordinary art direction, several clever gameplay solutions and a near-perfect control system. The plot, on the other hand, had left us dumbfounded: although it looks like a sequel, the story of Darksiders II actually takes place in parallel to that of the first Darksiders and delves into some dark sides by following the deeds of Death and his attempts to exonerate his brother War and find out who hatched the plot that is putting the horsemen of the Apocalypse in crisis to the detriment of planet Earth. Unfortunately, however, not all knots come to a head and the fate of our anti-heroes and the entire universe remains uncertain precisely because the two narrative arcs collide in the final, leaving the story pending. Perhaps it is for this reason that Nordic Games has decided not to remaster the first adventure as well, believing that playing the second was enough to sufficiently understand the complicated narrative universe of Darksiders, but in our opinion the suffix in the title could represent an important deterrent for those who he is not informed about the saga and the contents of the two games, also because Darksiders II ends with a real cliffhanger that refers to that third episode that has never been done and will never be done, if this Deathinitive Edition does not sell as much as hoped . That would be a real shame, because the characters and worlds conceived by Joe Madureira and his former colleagues are fascinating and full of character, and the apocalyptic storyline told, while suffering from some uncertainty in the second half of Darksiders II, is original and interesting, thanks also of the superb soundtrack composed by Jesper Kyd and of the excellent voice acting. Playstation 4 trophies Trophy hunters who thrashed Darksiders II on PlayStation 3 will have a death... um, easy life as the new trophies are all pretty much the same: 40 bronze, 6 silver, 3 gold, plus platinum. Some, however, are brand new: for example, you will have to finish the game on the new difficulty level to unlock the golden trophy The End. Get up and walk On the gameplay front, the Deathinitive Edition of Darksiders II won't upset fans who already completed the adventure a few years ago: in this sense, Nordic Games didn't exactly go to waste when it brought together the former developers of Vigil Games - now led by David Adams in the new Gunfire Games team - to work on this conversion. The game has remained almost the same: in the role of Death we will have to explore the Earth, the afterlife and other markedly fantasy worlds and complete the missions entrusted to us from time to time by our supporting actors. Although the main questline almost always boils down to visiting a certain number of settings in search of a certain number of artifacts, sometimes appearing redundant, the variety in terms of scenarios, enemies and puzzles is such as to always keep the player's interest high even when some situations go on a little too long, especially in the final lines. The Deathinitive Edition, however, includes all DLC released at the time, which Gunfire Games implemented organically in the original structure of the game, in order to offer a more cohesive and less fragmented experience. Too bad, therefore, that the aforementioned DLCs have never particularly shone in quality; in any case, however, they represent an added value and prolong the already good longevity of the main adventure, which can be completed in about twenty hours. Collector freaks will find their match, as the Darksiders II multiverse is full of secrets, zones to revisit after unlocking a new power-up or gadget, and mini-games to play once you've learned how to fight like a true horseman of the Apocalypse. In this regard, the guys from Gunfire Games have balanced the distribution of loots slightly better in order to make each new weapon or piece of equipment more interesting and push the player to decide more carefully what to wear and what to throw away. However, the progression and customization system of Darksiders II remains unchanged, with the player being able to change his weapon and therefore his style of play, choosing which skill to buy with the points earned in battle. The combat system, therefore, still remains very valid, frenetic and fun, as well as the gigantic bosses to be faced using the brain as well as the muscles, perhaps riding the trusty Despair. If there isn't much to criticize in terms of content, the technical side is the one that instead shows the side more, despite the fact that we are talking about a remastered conversion: Gunfire Games has done the homework without making too much effort, increasing the resolution to 1080p and applying some nice filters and a nice brushing of anti-aliasing. Darksiders II has never been a monster of graphics but has always had style to spare, so the improvements made have only partially enhanced its appearance: what left us with a bitter taste, if anything, was the fact that the game doesn't run at 60 frames per second and that the frame rate falters more frequently than in the original from a few years ago. What's more, the developer hasn't fixed either the camera issues we complained about in 2012 or the sporadic cases of tearing.", "date": "2015-11-03", "grade": "7.8"}
