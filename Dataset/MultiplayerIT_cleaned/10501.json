The basic concept has always been to develop the typically hardcore mechanics of the genre to the extreme, combining them with large-caliber bands, trying to convince the many fans to buy these titles out of love and passion. And in itself it has also worked very well at least on a couple of occasions. Arriving at the possibility of being able to manage the rights to the Beatles catalog, however, Harmonix's mission could not only be to produce yet another single-group title, even if dedicated to the most legendary band of popular music, but it could be the first step to mark a path that other games will certainly follow, even in the short term: to leave aside the impossible solos at full speed, to put songs on the track that are all enjoyable, both singing and playing, by any player or family member. A result of this type, also putting together the pieces of a practically flawless software, was what we hoped could happen, but which was far from simple to achieve. The Fab Four Putting everything you need at home to enjoy The Beatles: Rock Band to the fullest requires both a little space, given that between the five-piece drum set, signed bass and microphone, the cubic centimeters that leave are respectable, and a little ' of money, the ones needed to buy one of the two available bundles (while remembering that RB is compatible with any instrument/microphone that has been purchased previously). What you get in return is a collection of some of the most famous songs in the history of the Beatles (some are sensationally absent to entice future purchases of both packaged and digital delivery expansions), organized chronologically with painstaking work that starts from the graphic impeccable performance of the four musicians, which changes according to the different fashions crossed over the years of their career, up to a series of images and films seasoned with anecdotes collected and told by the still surviving protagonists. To unlock all the photos and videos, you need to get the maximum stars, five, in performing each song in the story mode, singing or playing any instrument even on the lowest difficulty level, while retracing the stages of the band. In addition to this there are the challenges, which are nothing more than the sets of songs already present in the career, but which must be played all in one go and necessarily achieving the maximum stars, so as to obtain the photo provided as a reward for each one of them . The songs certainly don't require a superhuman effort to tame, and those who are able to finish any Rockband or Guitar Hero on expert level, will be able to finish The Beatles on the hardest level on the first pass with maximum stars without too much difficulty. and then dedicate yourself to the achievement of all the objectives / trophies. But this is not the point. This game can be the starting point for learning to play the drums, without the trauma of incomprehensible speeds even at the highest difficulty, or the way to perfect yourself with the guitar and bass by unlocking all the bonuses. Above all, knowing that any relative or friend won't be able to back down in front of a timeless and perfectly accessible repertoire, without the fear that sooner or later, the song of some improbable Norwegian heavy metal band will pop up, as usually happens in the escalation of difficulty that marks the structure of this type of game. The video review Xbox 360 goals To get a decent score with The Beatles: Rock Band you need to have all the instruments and know how to play discreetly, given that to unlock between 500 and 600 points the writer had to carry on the career of all the instruments as an expert. The objectives, however, are a decidedly well-implemented aspect that will be able to give good longevity to those who will be conquered and decide to continue in obtaining them. There are also cons Obviously not all that glitters is gold, and The Beatles: Rock Band is no exception, given that it is not possible to access the vast repertoire of songs on the Rockband circuit and that, therefore, only the songs of the Liverpool band can be purchased. And this for some may be a limitation, in addition to the fact that the 45 songs available are less than those usually obtained by buying games of the genre, in addition to the lack of all those options relating to the creation of the character and the purchase of guitars and objects, to which those who chew bread and rhythm game are now abituated. To balance everything in terms of longevity there are the usual online modes and, above all, the possibility of connecting up to three USB microphones (or those of Lips for those who own it on Xbox), to allow up to three singers to try their hand at the main harmonies of the voice, rather than with the choirs and backing vocals, launching into real harmonies that the software detects flawlessly. Which, combined with the perfect rendering of the atmosphere and the feeling of reliving the key passages of the group's history in every context, makes this game an almost totally successful experiment.", "date": "2009-09-30", "grade": "9.0"}
