At the dawn of the current generation, the SEGA series joined the iconic Tetris to give life to a particularly fun and successful combination, which then also landed in the West no later than a couple of years ago. On Japanese soil, Puyo Puyo Chronicle was even proposed, which on Nintendo 3DS also gave access to an RPG mode complete with puzzle-based battles and a character leveling system. Puyo Puyo Champions, on the other hand, remains strictly faithful to tradition by offering fans of the genre a very arcade and direct approach, based on competition with fierce opponents managed by the CPU or other real players, both locally and in online multiplayer. Available on PC, PlayStation 4, Switch and Xbox One, the game includes two titles in one package, allowing you to opt for both Puyo Puyo 2 and Puyo Puyo Fever at will. Read on for our review to find out more. Quick eye and strategic approach At first glance, Puyo Puyo Champions would seem to share many similarities with Tetris, but it only takes a couple of games to realize that the approach is quite different. Also in this case we are faced with a multitude of small blocks that descend vertically from top to bottom, and it is necessary to arrange them with a precise criterion to associate them and improve one's score. Usually the spheres appear in groups of two, sometimes with different colors, and can be rotated at will to create different combinations. You don't need a specific composition, as it is enough to associate four units of the same color to see them disappear from the screen and get a bonus in return. In this case, however, you don't have to limit yourself to playing taking into account variables such as the progressive speed of the blocks or the improvement of a score to climb a leaderboard, but vice versa you have to face a direct clash with one or more opponents who will try to do everything everything possible to put a spanner in the works and make survival in the match increasingly difficult. In fact, everything is based on the concatenation of combinations formed by four blocks; performing one point at a time while keeping the playing area clean is not the best tactic: going forward it will in fact be necessary to try to prepare the ground in order to chain combos composed of at least three or four combinations at a time. The higher this value is, the greater the amount of garbage sent to the opponent's screen will be revealed, in the form of gray spheres that cannot be associated with any other piece, which are systematically dropped from above, making it more complex to chain the other blocks in a coherent. To eliminate them you must have the foresight to bring about various effective combinations adjacent to each other, but if the opponent manages to chain two or three well-aimed series it will become practically impossible to be able to resist the shock wave. In short, to be successful with Puyo Puyo Champions it will be necessary not so much to limit oneself to keeping one's grid clean, but to arrange the pieces in a strategic way, risking something in view of a greater return in the more advanced stages of the match. In the absence of a tutorial, this approach must be assimilated with experience. At first, players new to the series could therefore feel a little displaced, also because the enemy AI will not go down softly at all. The onset of frustration is around the corner, but with a pinch of patience you can learn from your own mistakes and get to master situations with a little more foresight. In both available titles it is possible to lean towards the Solo Mode, which offers two variants: the Battle mode, in which you have to contend with one or more opponents at a time, or the Endurance, which involves facing one enemy at a time without a solution continuity, on the condition of continuing to win. While Puyo Puyo 2 offers a standard and more linear approach, in Puyo Puyo Fever a further variable to consider is the opportunity to trigger the so-called Fever mode, which basically allows you to receive score bonuses for a limited period of time. allowing you to chain together a large number of blocks at the expense of your opponent. However, the best of Puyo Puyo Champions emerges by accessing multiplayer games, which can be used both locally and online. In the first case it is allowed to play matches on a single console by dividing the joy-cons, or to connect up to four wirelessly. Alternatively, there is the online section, which, however, can be accessed on sonly if you have a subscription to the Nintendo Switch Online service. One of the interesting features of this section concerns the possibility of observing other players at work through the Replays, which therefore allow you to become familiar with the most advanced techniques applied by the most expert opponents.", "date": "2019-05-20", "grade": "7.5"}
