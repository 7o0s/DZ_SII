{"name": "Il gran finale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/129209-eschalon-book-iii-il-gran-finale.html", "text": "With the third installment of this series of RPGs inspired by the great classics, which has been in development for some time and has finally appeared on Steam and GoG.com, the formula does not change and offers us a three-quarter view, several hours of gameplay, classic quests, an articulated story and rather difficult turn-based combat. Success of attacks is decided by dice rolls based on character skills and stats, and the results are shown in the classic text feed that includes important notices and descriptions. All extremely classic but, as in the case of the previous chapters, made intriguing by the contents. The plot is rich, the atmosphere is good, the evolution of characters is complex and the fights, especially when our hero's level increases, can be downright fun. Initially, however, the limitations are felt and the difficulty is calibrated approximately. First of all, although this is the third and final chapter of the trilogy, we start from scratch, in canvas breeches and lost in a swamp. A beginning probably dedicated to newbies, with the title recounting all the main events of the previous chapters becoming independent, but if the intention was to welcome the new audience made possible by the new frontiers of digital distribution, things didn't go according to plan. plans. In fact, players find themselves forced to face, in a very unepic climate, a long series of monotonous fights with the usual giant insects to complete uninspired quests. Certainly not a novelty, even for those who have never touched a classic RPG. The result is that in the initial phase of Eschalon: Book III, frustration, both for fans of the series and for those who have never touched it, can reach very high peaks and in this case the difficulty of the fights, which also offers us creatures immune to the only weapon in our possession, it doesn't help. Eschalon: Book III is the latest chapter in a trilogy dedicated to fans of classic RPGs The charm of the classic Eschalon isn't a jaw-dropping series, and it doesn't really shine in the field of isometric RPGs either. The graphics have gradually been enriched from chapter to chapter but the new elements are not enough to perform a miracle. The protagonist, to begin with, moves like Mel Brooks' Frankenstein and different environments, often due to not too varied textures, are flat and uninspired. In any case, let it be clear, that aesthetics is not a vital component to benefit from such a title, whose requirements are decidedly low, and not all aesthetic work is evil. There are, in fact, intriguing creatures, the dwarfs have an amazing model and there is no lack of a whole series of aesthetic details, such as the fireflies that light up at night or the clouds that occasionally pass in front of the shot, which increase the identification and distract from the general static nature of the graphics. Furthermore, by overcoming the look that can be a big obstacle for some but which in this genre of titles quickly fades into the background, we discover a trilogy capable of mixing high complexity with an intuitive interface. The game system, in fact, includes alchemy, spells divided by levels, religions and skills in profusion, complete with a penalty for heavy armor or due to the lack of a particular skill. And there is even a stealth-like system that warns us if someone hears our footsteps or the clatter of our equipment. Furthermore, to underline the hardcore nature of the game, it is also possible to play in realistic mode by activating equipment decay, save limits and the need to feed. In short, enough to entice die-hard fans of the RPG genre even if, in an already difficult title like this, it takes a moment for the challenge to turn into frustration. But even the bravest, if nothing else, have nothing to worry about on the interface front. On the Eschalon: Book III screen, everything is just a mouse click away with vivid icons, a clear ~quest log~ and even an option that allows you to choose a pre-set secondary equipment on the fly, Diablo II style, in order to better face certain situations. Unfortunately, this setup also has an obvious problem. The portion of the screen dedicated to the action is very small and even if the interface can be minimized, doing so makes little sense given that the maximum resolution is 1024x768 pixels. What if it's too classic? Eschalon: Book III, as we have already said, is not a question of aesthetics and we can hardly pass even on the antediluvian resolution. But, even taking into account the modest nature of the project, there are no shortcomingstechnical nature that would have been solved with a little more attention. If the graphics are not always important, in fact, the question is different in the case of the control of the character who in the Basilisk title is often woody beyond the obvious limitations dictated by a movement system bound to only eight directions. Furthermore, only the tip of the cursor is considered in interactions with the mouse and this forces the player to have to ~work~ a little too much to recover loot or activate mechanisms. Nothing unbearable, mind you, even if four years in the making leave plenty of time for refinements which, nowadays, are important. In any case, the work of the team emerges in other sectors. The texts are concise but valid and the musical sector, between sound effects and music, does an excellent job. Unfortunately, the regret for the poor balance remains even if the risk-free exploration loses a pinch of charm and sometimes the sudden surprises, however negative, are just what the hardcore player craves to be stimulated and it is not surprising that those who appreciate this series do it with all my heart. Freedom to try at all costs, therefore, even if the word balance is not synonymous with easy and does not necessarily imply a lack of freedom. In any case, overcoming limits and obstacles, Eschalon: Book III can give satisfaction thanks to a rich gameplay which, among other things, includes treasures, puzzles, four combat positions, a dark night that forces you to hold a torch in order not to lose the way and different funny fights. All elements that lead to regret even more the lack of a more intriguing and less canonical departure, a start with a bang that would have eased the frustration due to the approximate balancing. A real shame given the clear potential of a title and a series which, especially in this all-indie era of rediscovering the classics, could have addressed a wider audience without having to give up complexity and high difficulty.", "date": "2014-03-07", "grade": "6.5"}
