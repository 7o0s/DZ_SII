{"name": "The Walking Dead - Episode 1", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102557-the-walking-dead-telltale-games-risorge.html", "text": "Telltale Games was born to tell stories set in worlds imagined by others. Unfortunately, the last published series, the one with the Jurassic Park brand, risked extinguishing the developers under shovelfuls of criticism. Today, however, a new license of great appeal extends a rapacious hand from the ground to trap us in its narrative grip. The Walking Dead is in fact taken from the homonymous horror comic created by Robert Kirkman and published by Image Comics, which many know for the television series still broadcast in Italy. Kirkman's famous comic portrays ordinary people grappling with a zombie apocalypse. The living dead are everywhere, day and night. However, the atmosphere is not that of a horror film. In fact, zombies become for the survivors what wild animals were for primitive men: the representation of a hostile nature that kills out of survival instinct. Human beings are therefore plunged into a wild and tribal logic where ethics, compassion and civilization are words that take on disturbing meanings or lose them completely. The comic is exceptional in probing the anxieties of the characters and their struggle not to lose hope and remain lucid despite the daily brutality. In short, a good challenge for Telltale Games, which however has shown that it has fully understood Kirkman's work. At least as far as we could understand from an episode that lasts just a few hours. A good starting point is the brand new cast, which only crosses paths with characters from the comic series, who are not allowed a leading role. On the other hand, proposing secondary paths with respect to the reference universe has always been a precise choice of the developers. In any case, fans will discover many quotes and background of events that have taken place only in the comic. However, in the game it all starts aboard a police car. But we are not the sheriff, but the convict sitting in the back seat. Accidental father Lee Everett has been convicted of a crime and is sitting in the sheriff's car, waiting to get to the jail. Suddenly, however, the car overwhelms a person, ending up dangerously off the road. From that moment on, Lee's world will never be the same. Instead who this character actually is we will decide. In fact, during the dialogues we will be able to choose whether his first thought is for his parents or for his wife. And did that crime have any justification or is Lee a heinous criminal? Is he an egoist or a savior? Open or ambiguous? All these nuances are decided by choosing one answer over another in the limited time that the game allows us when we talk to someone. Fortunately, the alternatives are not of the ~sensible answer~, ~sirocco answer~ and ~bastard answer~. On the contrary: it is difficult to assign a precise moral value to one street rather than another. Even the way our interlocutors look at us will change depending on how we place ourselves towards them. One person in particular will still bind to us to follow us until the end of the series. It's about a little girl we meet right after the accident with the police car. Her name is Clementine and she has lost her parents. Clementine is a wonderful character. Smart and resourceful when she has to survive for days alone and with zombies in the garden, but struggling to go to the bathroom. The relationship that is created between Lee, who has no children, and Clementine, who chooses to rely on him, is one of the emotional pillars of this first episode. It's also perfect for highlighting Lee's contradictions, prerogatives of adults that children don't understand. Even if we can't decide to abandon Clementine, once again it will be up to us to choose whether to become a new father figure or an abrupt caretaker. Life hangs on a Quick Time Event The Walking Dead begins with an ambitious promise to players along the lines of ~every choice you make will affect how events unfold throughout the series.~ As we have said, the game offers many opportunities to decide who the protagonist really is and the degree of trust or suspicion with which the other characters turn to him. However, there are other sudden, very dramatic moments in which two people are in danger of their lives and we have to decide in a very short time which of the two to save. Unfortunately it is not possible to save them both, so one of the two troubled souls will leave the series. In the narration of the single episode these emotional peaks touch the player but leave the flow of events essentially unchanged. After the episode, however, the game shows us a trailer for the next oneor, in which we see the people we have saved acting and not those left to their fate. It is therefore to be believed that what we have decided will change the course of events on a large scale, so that it will be possible to replay the whole season several times and take new narrative paths. We'll see. The Walking Dead on the other hand is an interactive story and leaves little room for game dynamics. There are two cases: either we have a very limited freedom of movement available, or we can only look around us. There are also no puzzles of any kind, you just need to figure out which sensitive point to interact with first. If nothing else, every action is justified by necessity and perfectly integrated into the story of the game. Zombies are there but, as happens in comics, they remain in the background, omnipresent threats ready to pop out suddenly. In the rare clashes we have to aim the zombie with an unstable viewfinder to hit it or quickly press a key and then another immediately to get it away from us. As a combat simulation of an interactive adventure it is acceptable and the dramatic effect convincing. However, it is clear that finishing The Walking Dead is a piece of cake and in fact it ends in a breath. Scarce two hours and we are already at the end credits, but longing for the next episode like hungry zombies. Yes, because the obvious limits of the game are cleverly masked by the developers who have achieved a good balance between forced passages and the player's discretion, so as to leave us the impression of being the directors of the action. Furthermore, the active participation in the dialogues, which are also a constant in comics, puts us directly in the role of the protagonist, making even the most banal exchanges engaging. This does not happen in the television series. Save it for the next time they tell you that a video game is worth less than a movie. We turn screen The art direction of The Walking Dead couldn't be more spot on. The screens look like hand-painted comic strips and do justice to the artistry of Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard, the two illustrators of Kirkman's work. On certain occasions, such as inside the grocery store, if you get up from your chair and move a few meters away from the screen, you will feel like you are observing a moving Edward Hopper painting. However, the best impression is made during the day, when the game can count on light effects, while the second part of the adventure, set at night, is less seductive from a visual point of view. In any case, even with the maximum settings, the graphic peaks typical of a high-performance PC are not reached. Beyond the purely technical issues however, the animations and facial expressions are much more convincing than we expected. You immediately become attached to Clementine and, strange to say, it is precisely the comic cut that encourages emotional contact between the player and the characters. With all due respect to photorealism. Halt, Italian speaker! If you are a fan of the Kirkman comic, you love the Telltale style and you are about to put your wallet in hand, stop by. The Walking Dead is all in English. Very well dubbed and with practical subtitles, but still in the language of the queen. So if you don't feel safe forget it because you will miss all the fun. This is a huge limit to the diffusion of The Walking Dead in our country. Such a pity; we hope that at the end of the series they will decide to offer at least one translation of the subtitles. Then there is another very annoying question. If you are a PC user you have to shell out the money immediately for the entire series despite only one episode being released. Users with a PS3 or an Xbox 360 will be able to buy the episodes one at a time. Another inexplicable choice that will only push many players to wait for the end of the series before buying it. And who knows if by then the desire has passed.", "date": "2012-05-07", "grade": "8.0"}
