{"name": "TimeShift - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/timeshift-recensione_a.html", "text": "Time flies The main feature of Timeshift, quite obviously given the title of the game, is the total possibility of controlling the flow of time, slowing it down, stopping it or bringing it back, in a way quite similar to what we saw in Prince of Persia, without however having the ability to come back from the dead and have your actions influenced by altered temporal effects: in other words, the suit's potential will operate on the surrounding environment, enemies included, leaving our alter-ego's movements almost unchanged virtual, which will however have the possibility of exploiting the situation to its advantage. Knowing how to best combine the powers offered by the technology of the future is therefore the key to success in the game, both in terms of firefights and puzzles: to do this, it is possible to rely on the pressure of a single key , through which the AI of the game chooses which of the 3 skills to use (not without some flaws to tell the truth), however, taking away the fun for the player to guess the best power to face the situation in front of him, or to combine in intelligently such specialties. Quite simply, but the first few times it is easy to get confused, just hold down the L1 key and press one of the 4 front buttons of the pad to activate the temporal powers, in the same way as seen on Xbox 360. Time flies The use of the suit is not unlimited, as there is obviously an energy bar, once which is consumed the entire equipment needs a certain recharging period, so the choice and above all the times of use of the powers must be made with the maximum attention, otherwise you will find yourself surrounded by enemies as angry as they are armed to the teeth. Another feature of the suit involves firefights, since it is able to protect and regenerate the protective shield and vital conditions, without having to play thinking about medicines or similar things capable of increasing energy vital, but simply trying to repair itself in the worst moments to allow the suit to restore its energy. The interludes are also very nice in which by stopping time it is possible to steal the weapon from the enemy, who will subsequently be surprised wondering how the rifle disappeared from his hands. Revolving, TimeShift, entirely around the possibilities opened up by the use of the suit, it is reasonable to expect not only spectacular game actions, but also a variety of situations within it: in these terms, unfortunately, Saber Interactive fails to fully convince, since apart from the initial phase of getting to know the gameplay, later certain types of puzzles and combat modes will no longer present themselves as new, letting the appeal of the game drop a bit, also thanks to a small lack of identification with the main character, of which as previously mentioned, we don't even know the name. On balance then, a title certainly cannot count on a single aspect, albeit as important and fundamental as in this case, to attract portions of a market such as that of FPS, fierce in this period as perhaps it has never been previously: daring a little more by trying to innovate in other aspects of the game mechanics certainly wouldn't have hurt. And the rest? The gameplay of TimeShift fits perfectly into the classic ones of its genre, thus resulting, apart from time control, a valid product but not able to offer that breath of originality required by many gamers today: the arsenal at our disposal it consists of a maximum of 3 weapons to carry with you at the same time, so it will be necessary to try to diversify those present in our slots, trying to have both close combat rifles and others to face enemies from a long distance. From the point of view of the composition, the weapons are shown as hybrids between modern and non-modern rifles, often maintaining a base made of bullets but with a fairly futuristic design, equipped with primary and secondary fire according to the classic FPS canons, without forgetting the grenades. From the point of view of battles, very often we will find ourselves facing a fairly large number of opponents, against whom it will be essential to know how to use both weapons, whose ammunition is almost never abundant, and the weather control suit, which as previously mentioned plays a key role within the game. A few more than positive words deserve multiplayer, where they are present, in addition to fashionclassic modes, even some derived from the adaptation of time controls to games with multiple human players: the funniest is certainly the one in which only one player actually has the opportunity to use the suit's powers, but is alone to fight against all the others. To avoid giving special powers to all participants in multiplayer games, the programmers have also thought well of introducing special grenades into the online mode through which they can alter the flow of time only in a specific area of the map and for a few moments, going thus creating a game mechanic which, although approaching that of the single player, fits perfectly into the context of the match via the network. Does beauty stand the test of time? From the point of view of technical implementation, TimeShift behaves admirably, showing that Vivendi saw well in demanding additional work from Saber Interactive, a team that for its part was able to take advantage of the situation to come up with a title capable of recover that performance gap reported by the publisher. The graphic effects related to the use of powers are very well done and suitable for the distorted representation of the time flow, just as in general one cannot complain about the level of detail, whether we refer to objects or enemies. Also interesting are the graphic effects relating to the abundant gore that the title gives us, with an exaggerated amount of hemoglobin given liberally by our enemies, which even ends up on the screen, with beautiful red patches as a reward for our burning fire fur. From the point of view of gameplay, the graphic effect that is activated when the vital energy is low is a bit annoying: the screen gradually becomes covered in red, preventing the player from satisfactorily distinguishing the elements on the screen . The audio also turns out to be of good quality, relying on excellent dubbing, in addition to the classic audio effects related to explosions, shots and so on. Compared to the Xbox 360 version, this port denounces some small critical issues, placing it one step below the Microsoft console version. Nothing particularly alarming but those who have played both versions will notice some sporadic drops in frame rates, and a decidedly present aliasing in multiplayer games. Comment Initially born as a second tier title, TimeShift pays in part due to its troubled development process, which has seen changes in all aspects related to the game, from the publisher to the setting: from an idea that proves to be more than good and quite unexplored in the FPS field, the result is a title that dares too little in those aspects that could have detached it from the classic canons of its genre, to which it unfortunately remains too tied, resulting in the long run repetitive despite being able to give a good gaming experience. Saber Interactive demonstrates through TimeShift that it can still have its say in the competitive field of first-person shooters, without being able to effectively counter the recently released big guns. Furthermore, Timeshift's multiplayer certainly deserves to be tried by anyone, given the well thought out and guessed introductions of the development team into the gameplay via the network.Pros Graphics and audio more than good Checking the time is very fun Excellent multiplayer mode Cons Too unoriginal Incomplete plot", "date": "2007-12-14", "grade": null}
