Clearly the Hot Wheels Unleashed review is designed, like the production, only for a part of this audience: the one who prefers the arcade approach, immediacy, light-heartedness and a soft learning curve for an accessible but not banal; certainly not the level of simulation or the technicalities of other well-known and important names, such as Gran Turismo, Assetto Corsa, Forza Horizon, and so on. Therefore, the approach chosen by Milestone for Hot Wheels Unleashed is not surprising, decidedly lighter and more welcoming than the other driving games to which the Italian developer has accustomed us. However, what intrigued us the most was to find out if Hot Wheels Unleashed has kept the promises made in the past months, offering a fun and adrenaline-pumping experience, which however remained faithful and respectful of the essence of the franchise. The answer, we anticipate it, is positive. Game Mode: Hot Wheels City Rumble One of the many toy cars from Hot Wheels Unleashed The main game modes of Hot Wheels Unleashed are basically three, all (obviously) based on racing on circuits: quick race, time attack, finally split screen. These three basic proposals are immediately present on the screen in the main menu, precisely because they are perfect for those who want to play for just a few minutes and finally abandon everything until the next session. It would be trivial to insist on the individual contents: it is obvious that ~fast race~ consists of the classic race against artificial intelligence, and that out of twelve toy cars in the race you have to arrive first at the finish line (or at least among the first three). ~Time Attack~ offers the opportunity to test yourself on very specific tracks, to be completed within a certain number of minutes: here it is important to make the most of your Hot Wheels, as well as the specific conformations of the track itself. Finally, split screen allows you to play shoulder to shoulder in the company of a friend equipped with a second controller (there is also the online mode, don't worry). This offer, made as varied as possible based on the exploitation of different tracks and at least slightly original game environments, represents the main and most essential package of Hot Wheels Unleashed. As a delicious topping is added an original variant of the career mode called City Rumble. In Hot Wheels City Rumble you will find yourself in front of a map with many boxes, a bit like the ~game of the goose~, in which you have to advance by winning the individual races along the way. We were talking about variations: it is difficult for you to find the exact same challenge twice in a row; instead there is a good alternation between quick races, time attacks, increasing difficulties and even boss fights (in which the races simply have to be completed by respecting certain conditions). Participating in Hot Wheels City Rumble is essential to accumulate gears and coins: with the former, the individual cars owned by the player are strengthened, because obviously it is nice to make the little car you are in love with more performing, perhaps even since you were a child. The coins, on the other hand, are mandatory for the purchase of the new packs, a sort of surprise box that guarantees a new machine of random rarity. Hot Wheels City Rumble keeps busy for a fair number of hours, around 8-10: it does its job, even if more than someone might prefer a slightly less chaotic progression, if necessary at the price of greater underlying linearity (which in truth is still present although disguised by different frills, colors and tracks). Track Builder and Collecting Some crazy tracks from Hot Wheels Unleashed Echoing the building element of Hot Wheels tracks, Hot Wheels Unleashed combines racing with a variety of car and track customization options. One of the most successful aspects of Milestone's product is precisely the freedom it makes available both with the cars and with the tracks: everyone can not only find their favorite car, but also make it different from the starting model using the livery editor (imagine the potential linked to online). The apotheosis of this customization consists in the Track Builder, through which it is possible to design your own track from scratch, all its accessories, and even share it online with players from all over the world (and you can clearly download those already loaded on the server ). Initially the Track Builder editor may appear a bit sparse, but spending the right amount of time you realize its potential; the system will certainly comeand improved in the future, but already now it is versatile and functional. Slopes, curves, obstacles, speed boosters  you can design your own track to any taste; as well as the surrounding environment, choosing one of those proposed by the game (the tavern, the garage, the university area, the construction site, and so on). Some crazy tracks from Hot Wheels Unleashed Even a part of these external environments, which act as a context and guarantee the right atmosphere for the races of the toy cars, can in turn be personalized. It can therefore happen to buy Hot Wheels Unleashed simply for racing and then get lost in the maze of its rich editors who, we assure you, guarantee just as much satisfaction. A separate discussion must be made for collecting. It is true that you could lose several hours before finding ~your~ Hot Wheels (there are more than sixty of them in the basic version of the game), but it must also be said that collecting coins is not very simple: you must necessarily continue in City Rumble, winning race after race and completing the career. After all, what would be the point of unlocking gears and coins without being able to spend them to enrich your collection? The cars present range from well-known models to others a little more in the shadows, to which are added a disproportionate number of DLCs and packages for sale in the shop (in exchange for real money), especially for some noteworthy brands. In short, you won't find Batman or Barbie's car simply by playing, you will have to buy it. But everything else can be unlocked without spending any more money.", "date": "2021-09-27", "grade": "8.0"}
