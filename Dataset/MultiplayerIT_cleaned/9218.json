It was thus possible to thoroughly analyze the ideas suggested in the past months. As announced, this new chapter goes to deepen the generational dynamics, the different needs and lifestyles of each age, always with the witty touch to which the Sims have accustomed us over the years. Also in the customization phase we are witnessing the introduction of brand new elements. Thus, we will range from objects for early childhood, including strollers and new toys, to adulthood, with wedding cakes and video cameras, up to seniority with the possibility of choosing between different sticks and so on. Generations compared Generational differences are addressed in full for the first time in The Sims 3: Generations, and each stage of life is characterized by very different purposes, just like in real life. The days of the little ones, for example, are moved by the taste for discovery and a large dose of imagination: it is not uncommon to find an imaginary friend (aesthetically a bit disturbing to tell the truth) who will be able to keep the little Sim company. The age of childhood is covered in minute detail in each of its stages; school activities punctuate the weekly days and can be faced with different spirits, as well as the choice to occupy one's free time, being able to decide whether to lead a life as a model child or a little brat in the mood for jokes. For teenagers, on the other hand, it's a completely different story: the sense of rebellion and restlessness typical of that stage of life is brought to the highest levels here. Between chaotic parties, first dates and proms, Sims of the first ~transition age~ will find something for their teeth. There are frequent jokes (less innocent than those played by children) against adults or peers and the desire to break the rules is strong. Once you move into adulthood, however, the rebellious spirit subsides and gives way to the ~desire to settle down~: adult Sims feel the need to form stable relationships and, why not, start a family. But not before a wild bachelor party! New styles of interaction have been introduced, from talking about the studies carried out to fighting with pillows, without forgetting romantic actions to flirt in a more or less explicit way. Of course, life is not so simple with everyone, so much so that it is possible to experience the famous midlife crisis. Finally, with seniority the Sims become more fragile, but also wiser and eager to remember the good old days, perhaps reliving them by mirroring themselves in their young heirs. As they say, life is a spinning wheel, even for the world of The Sims. So new, so familiar The presence of a wide range of brand new objects and interactions never seen before are not the only innovations introduced in this chapter. New personality traits and physical characteristics will be selectable in the Create a Sim section. New jobs and ambitions will come with new rewards (such as becoming a Super Nanny or being able to instantly rejuvenate). Also unpublished are various creative possibilities: from the box of costumes for children to the possibility of creating videos of one's memories, from the creation of mysterious potions with the ~little chemist~ kit... to the ability to clone oneself by giving birth to a little Sim completely identical to the parent! This latest expansion, The Sims 3: Generations, undoubtedly represents one of the most versatile chapters of the entire saga in terms of interactions, with multiple and original possibilities for action, increasingly close to real life. All the new activities introduced can also be remembered and handed down to posterity thanks to the ~memory system~, which allows you to trace a real sequence of the most relevant events in your Sim's life, with the possibility of sharing them on your Facebook account or on your personal page of thesims.com. In reality, despite the many additions, we are always faced with the dear old The Sims 3 with its strengths and weaknesses; after all, this is and remains an expansion. The gaming experience, despite the addition of multiple elements, is almost comparable to that of the main title, unlike previous experiments such as Travel Adventures, where we witnessed the introduction of a simple mission system capable of moving, even geographically , the placid days of any Sim. Here, on the other hand, life flows peacefully without any particular jolts, except for the healthy gossip of the city's inhabitants. In short, aficionados of the series can only sguplay with joy in the variety of situations proposed, while those who don't already love the rhythms of the classic The Sims could turn up their noses in front of such a new but at the same time so familiar title.", "date": "2011-06-23", "grade": "7.8"}
