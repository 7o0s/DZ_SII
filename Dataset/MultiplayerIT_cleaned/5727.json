{"name": "Sabbia e arena", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163122-sandstorm-pirate-wars-sabbia-e-arena.html", "text": "In a scenario halfway between Mad Max and Fallout, where society has been wiped out by wars and cataclysms, Sandstorm: Pirate Wars puts us in the role of the commander of a flying ship, at the head of a crew of marauders traveling from point to point in the desert in order to collect money and resources. Having decided on a destination on the map, the game presents a progression very similar to that of drag racers, with our vehicle seen in a three-quarter view as it hurtles through the wastelands, crossing locations that were once cities and are now reduced to a pile of rubble sandy. During the crossing from one point of the journey to another, several things can happen: you can stop to check the remains of an abandoned ship or help a crew adrift, both situations that can turn into a trap and lead to the same epilogue : a spectacular combat between futuristic vessels, based on cannons, missiles and energy shields. Will we be able to build a ship powerful enough to ensure victory at all times? We will find out over the course of a long campaign, assisted by a multiplayer mode and various secondary missions, very useful for scraping together a little extra money and thus limiting the hassles of a freemium approach which already towards the end of the second chapter begins to show its cards, pushing us towards the grinding. Sandstorm: Pirate Wars is a nice title, interesting in its mechanics and rich in structure Boarding! The gameplay of Sandstorm: Pirate Wars takes up many of the aspects of tactical RPGs, including the issue of random fights: sometimes crossing a certain point on the map can lead us to have to fight, but there are cases where you travel without problems. Once we are approached by an enemy ship, the combat system is very simple: you have to select a weapon and a target, then wait for the system to load and fire automatically until that component of the hostile vehicle is destroyed . Systems such as energy shields or countermeasures against homing missiles are already introduced in the early stages, and from this point of view there is little to complain about, given that we are talking about an arsenal made up of something like a hundred different tools. Once loaded, a bar located on the left side of the screen allows you to enter a sort of special mode that changes depending on the ship used and which allows, for example, to obtain much faster cooldowns for weapons, or to restore destroyed systems. The system works very well and leverages the charm of constant growth, thanks to the collection of resources to upgrade the ship and its defenses, but in the same way it can be quite repetitive and often forces you to do a lot of backtracking on the map for completing side quests. Certainly the technical sector supports the action in the best possible way, thanks to detailed and convincing graphics, which effectively represent the weight of the ships and use good design choices. The soundtrack is also good, sufficiently ~epic~ to underline the value of the clashes.", "date": "2016-02-06", "grade": "7.5"}
