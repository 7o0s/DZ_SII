We're talking about those rhythm games that could be defined, in a sterile but certainly precise way, as ~rock band simulators~ that have made the key to their success of a formula as simple as it is ingenious: to give anyone the impression of being able to play a musical instrument and emulate their idols of rock, pop, metal ... even classical music, in some cases. The peripherals initially in the shape of a guitar, then flanked by basses, drums and microphones have seen the creation of a real custom phenomenon that could in some way be compared to the oriental Karaoke translated into a more easily understandable and assimilable formula by a western audience . Basically, it is a question of interpreting musicians and singers and through the simple percussion of keys or their surrogates ~playing~ the musical tracks that are proposed to us on the screen. True skill basically consists in keeping the rhythm and, depending on the difficulty set, being able to have agile and trained fingers. What do you do if you don't have a guitar? Rock Band Unplugged enters this panorama, however going to break a pattern. Until now we have in fact been used to seeing the aforementioned peripherals in the shape of a musical instrument as the strong and identifying point of this specific videogame genre, which have given players a sense of simulation far superior to the mere pressing of the keys of a pad or keyboard . The PSP version of the Harmonix brand instead arrives in our hands without any external support. In short, traditional controls for Rock Band's debut on PSP. On the other hand, the problem was not easy to solve: inserting hardware peripherals suitable for simulating Rock Band instruments for home platforms on a laptop that does not offer tricks such as the one adopted by the competitor Guitar Hero and his Guitar Grip for the Nintendo laptop became objectively complex. Harmonix solves the problem with great aplomb, deciding that if Mohammed can't go to the hardware then the gameplay will have to come from Mohammed. And he proposes a formula that is even trivial in its substance, but of immediate practical success: if we have a rock band, and this band is made up of vocals, bass, guitar and drums, why leave us to interpret one role at a time? Much better to manage the whole band and its instruments at once. And the formula works, and it works well too; in the performance of each song we have the whole band under our control, each of the four tracks will scroll side by side on the screen. To pass from one track (and therefore from one instrument) to another, simply press the backbones of the console, while the notes that descend to the screen must be played using four keys, cross and triangle and up and left of the directional cross, in default configuration. Finally, a key is responsible for activating the overdrive. The various tracks that make up the piece in its entirety are divided into verses. If played correctly, they will allow the active instrument's approval bar to stay high and allow us to move on to the next instrument. Errors in the reproduction of the sequences will instead cause, in addition to the lowering of the approval bar, the silence of the instrument in question and an evident decrease in the enjoyment of the song itself, missing one of its components. This having to constantly switch from one instrument to another and take care of the overall harmony of the execution makes the game particularly dynamic and, let's face it, engaging and fun, more than we expected. My Own Worst Enemy The main mode of the game is the well-known ~Tour~, which as usual leads us to face the climb to success through a series of concerts all over the world and the relative accumulation of money, fans and personnel. Then there is a ~Training~ mode, which consists of nothing more than a tutorial, and a section dedicated to extras that allows access to three other alternative modes: ~Survival~, ~Warm-up~ and ~Edit Game~. In the first we basically find ourselves playing in a sort of free mode, where the verses are abolished and we have to switch from one instrument to another in a completely arbitrary way, making it much more difficult to keep the bars high for all four members of the band . In Warm-up mode, on the contrary, we will be able to choose the track we prefer and switch completely freely from one instrument to another without fearing that the others will stop playing. Edit Game basically allows you toactivate some sort of built-in cheats, such as immunity, no solos, or unlocking all songs in the game. All side modes that leave the time they find a little, leaving the game to live on its main mode, the Tour. The truly big absentee, in this otherwise perfectly successful and lively title, is a multiplayer mode that strongly penalizes it, letting the execution of the forty or so tracks by past and modern authors (among which we mention Jethro Tull, the Foo Fighters, i System of a Down and even The Who) you become an end in itself and risk losing your edge when the specter of repetitiveness overlooks our games. It is true that the higher difficulties represent a real challenge to the most hardened player, it is true that the possibility of downloading additional songs from the store lengthens the life of the game a little, but it is also true that in the end the worst enemy of Rock Band Unplugged is precisely the total absence of a multiplayer sector. A real pity, because for the rest, whether it's gameplay or the technical sector, we are faced with a truly excellent game of its kind and perfectly inserted in the Sony laptop.", "date": "2009-07-13", "grade": "8.1"}
