A combination sublimated primarily by role-playing games, and secondly by adventure and fighting games. In the latter case, just think of the various Soul Calibur or Toshinden and, above all, the so-called beat-em-up and hack and slash which at the end of the 80s and a good part of the 90s dominated the sector scene, both in from bars than on home consoles. This is thanks to software houses such as Taito and his Rastan (1987), SEGA with the Golden Ax series (1989) and Capcom, which thanks to the experience gained with its scrolling fighting games, created a successful series of games which combined of the typical elements of role-playing games. How can we forget the various The King of Dragons (1991), Knights of the Round (1992), Dungeons & Dragons - Tower of Doom (1993) and Dungeons & Dragons - Shadow over Mystara (1996)? Especially the latter, already characterized at the time by an excellent multiplayer cooperative game mode, still represent two of the most worthy products dedicated to the world of fantasy for the genre. In the wake of the tradition of this type of game moves Sacred Citadel, the new project by SouthEnd Interactive for the digital platforms Xbox LIVE, PlayStation Network and PC. Linked to Deep Silver's action-RPG series entitled Sacred as a reference universe, the product is actually decidedly different from the latter in structural terms. The title in question is in fact a 2D horizontal scrolling hack and slash with role-playing game elements, along the lines, as mentioned, of those mentioned at the beginning of the article. The War of the Empire The player finds himself playing one of four selectable characters at the beginning of the adventure to save Ancaria from the Ashen Empire, with the possibility of taming mounts, acquiring various combat skills and conquering precious weapons and treasures. To represent the classes we thus have the traditional warrior Safiri all strength and action armed with a huge hammer, the skilled Ancarian hunter with the bow, the Khukuri shaman and the Serafina, more inclined to magic rather than physical combat (even if they do not disdain the use of weapons). Each hero is characterized by a physical appearance and his own set of personal skills, even if to tell the truth by choosing one over another, once on the field the ~technical~ differences between them are not so abysmal. The vast majority of the combos that can be performed are practically identical for all the characters, and the variants are limited to a couple of personal moves mainly related to the use of the second weapon, some magic and the special attack mappable to the Triangle button (Y for Xbox 360 owners). Each fighter increases his skills (health, defense, dexterity and attack power) at the end of each level, where in relation to bonuses related to what he did, such as the amount of damage inflicted on enemies, the physical energy lost or saved during the clashes and the time taken to complete the area, he gets a certain score. The points collected from a subsequent calculation can then be spent as desired by the player, who is left with a certain freedom for choosing the characteristics to improve first, and therefore for customization for his growth. The growth of the character also includes the purchase of items. In Sacred Citadel there is the presence of villages and small outposts located along the obligatory path of the adventure. Here, as in a normal role-playing game, in special stalls the user can buy new items, change weapons at the blacksmith or unlock some challenges by paying. In fact, it will be enough to talk to some special individuals to give life to a series of competitions to be carried out within the following scenario, and which range for example from defeating a series of enemies within a certain amount of time, to the obligation to complete an area without losing too much health. The coins to be collected in each level, therefore, are not only used to raise the score but find a credible and stimulating use in their own way. The Jungle Hunt DLC No sooner had the original game been released than Deep Silver made available an add-on for Sacred Citadel titled Jungle Hunt. The cost? 400 MS points or 4.99 Euros. This DLC obviously maintains the gameplay of the base game but offers a totally new chapter of the story, complete with a new setting and three bonus levels. The plot tells of Big Mama, the foul-smelling leader of the evil Grimmocs, who has escaped into the menacing jungle of Ancaria with a sacred relic that the four heroes must try to get back. Orcs likeif it rained In addition to the characters, settings and development of the same, references to the classics of the genre are also wasted in the gameplay. The main adventure is structured in acts, each of which represents a portion of the map within which there are then subsections. These are set in varied scenarios such as abandoned mines, forests, cities, snowy mountains and more. Inside them, the characters must make their way against the Grimmocs, hordes of ogres, trolls and creatures of all kinds taken with both hands from the western fantasy universe. The action is generally frenetic in the sense of the term, and as in most button-mashers the fights are not particularly demanding (except those with some bosses), especially when you have the possibility to cast powerful spells, even if the presence of a good number of enemies on the screen and the ability to move the characters in three dimensions, sometimes granting the user a slightly more strategic approach to the level. During the battle there are also objects that temporarily increase some skills, the classic smart bombs that can be launched using magical ampoules, and also weapons with which to eventually replace the second one equipped. There are also rideable animals, which change the approach to the game depending on the characteristics of the creature captured by the character. Sacred Citadel can be played solo or in multiplayer both locally and online for up to three players. And on the network this mode remains quite fluid and playable. Also via the internet, it is also possible to compare one's scores with those of other players around the world thanks to a ranking specifically used for this purpose. We close by taking a look at the technical aspect of the video game. As for the graphics, SouthEnd Interactive has opted for a style not very different from that of some American cartoons. The result is therefore well-characterized main characters, animated discreetly and in a different way depending on the size and class (for example, the sorceress Serafina performs moves as graceful as they are lethal), well-colored scenarios and embellished by the presence of animated elements such as snow, fire or the rain. Some flaws for the enemies, little variety in terms of design. The audio, on the other hand, settles at normal levels, adequately performing its ~task~ in any case: the music that accompanies the action can be classified as without infamy and without praise, they do not disturb but do not exalt, the game sound effects are average and the few voices used by the technicians for the various characters are all in all spot on.", "date": "2013-04-22", "grade": "7.0"}
