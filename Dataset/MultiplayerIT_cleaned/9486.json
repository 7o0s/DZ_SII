{"name": "Dead Space", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/84980-dead-space-ce-spazio-per-tutti.html", "text": "At the end of 2008, Dead Space was released on Ps3 and Xbox 360, a survival horror with a sci-fi setting created by the EA Visceral Games team; although the sales were not immediately exciting, over time and thanks to the word of mouth of the players and the positive evaluations of the specialized press, the title has managed to give particular satisfactions at the box office, to the point of allowing the birth of subsequent episodes that have been realized first with the spin off ~Extraction~ for Wii, and recently with the second chapter for the home consoles of Sony and Microsoft. Although the genre does not marry particularly with the characteristics of portable consoles, EA has nevertheless decided to try to reverse this trend by creating an exclusive declination for Apple devices. A touch screen in space Dead Space, without subtitles, on iOS devices has the great advantage of being a separate chapter, therefore specially created with in mind what the touch screen can (and cannot) do. At the plot level, this episode represents a filler between the first and second chapters; in fact, the events take place 3 years after the conclusion of Isaac Clarke's first adventure, and this time they see the engineer Vandal as the protagonist among the mines of the planet Titan. A story that is a prelude to the one narrated in Dead Space 2, therefore with pleasure for fans who want to know more about the background of the series. And it will be equally pleasant to face the first few minutes of this version on iOS, to realize after a few moments that Dead Space is not a cobbled together product set up just to take advantage of the success of the name it bears. On the contrary, it is a competent and solid project, which does not bow its head in the face of the quality standards imposed by Visceral Games with the main episodes. Considering the technical differences and the support for all generations of iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch hardware, the technical component is for example surprising, with a truly superior overview of most of the games available on the App Store. It is certainly a ~clever~ title, which knows which components to focus on and how to obtain the maximum possible result; for example, the polygonal modeling of the protagonist Vandal is certainly superior and more refined than that of the necromorphs, which instead show a few too many edges when observed closely. And the decision to set the vast majority of the adventure within small rooms and corridors has made it possible to maintain a good level of detail, which is impossible in the hypothesis of larger and more complex areas. Lastly, special effects, such as explosions, are very little. But nothing that can reduce the aesthetic value of Dead Space, which especially on the iPad is often able to leave pleasantly surprised. As far as the actual game is concerned, surely the greatest fear lay in the ability to be able to replicate or even partially maintain the level of tension and anxiety that constituted one of the greatest advantages on consoles. Despite the small screen, in optimal conditions we can ensure that the goal has been fully achieved, thanks above all to the excellent audio component which is absolutely fundamental in this sense; for this reason it is completely inadvisable to play Dead Space without headphones. In terms of mechanics and content, this version manages to replicate the standards imposed by the main series quite faithfully; the control system, although having to adapt to a touch screen that does not represent its natural environment, has been replicated satisfactorily. The handling of the character's movements is a bit wooden, and the accuracy when aiming with weapons is not perfect, but nothing you can't get used to. Probably the only weak point of Dead Space on iOS is to be found in the level design; a little too linear, without high notes and which relies excessively on the repetition of a formula (room full of enemies to be eliminated in order to continue) which gets boring in the long run. Longevity finally stands at 4 hours, divided into 12 chapters. The tested version is 1.0.1 Price: 5.49 App Store links", "date": "2011-02-08", "grade": "8.4"}
