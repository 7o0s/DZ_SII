However, this is not an idle sequel to the game released the previous year, but a decidedly ambitious project: we are talking about a shooter entirely devoted to online multiplayer, free, which allows interaction between iOS and Android users and which in the intentions of the development team will be subjected to constant updates in terms of content and various improvements. Slowly After a simple mandatory registration to play online, Shadowgun: Deadzone opens the door to a game world in which the good intentions of MADFINGER Games are more than evident: the main menu allows you to start a new game, access the equipment screen of the own alter ego, visit the online shop to buy new skins and various embellishments, open the research screen to unlock weapons and upgrades and view the friends list and rankings. In short, it is an absolutely well-assorted microcosm, equipped with a quantity of content capable of rivaling various multiplayer titles for home consoles. The difference here is all in the way in which the offer is made available to the user: being a free to play, Shadowgun: Deadzone can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, but to access some elements you need to pay. The product uses a dual-currency system similar to the one already adopted by Dead Trigger: after the games you get dollars as a reward to spend to buy new equipment or improve the one already in your possession, while the gold pieces (granted with much more thrifty) are used to access skins and heads for your character. For the more impatient MADFINGER Games is happy to make available packages that can be purchased with a credit card which give access to various quantities of gold, essential above all to unlock a premium account which guarantees +50% of money and experience, the addition voice chat and a privileged connection. All for periods of time ranging from one day to three months, at obviously proportional costs. The Czech developers have therefore paid attention to even the smallest details, obviously without forgetting the exquisitely playful part. In the midst of the action, Shadowgun: Deadzone showcases the winning features already emerged in the prequel, starting with a sumptuous graphic realization that confirms MADFINGER Games' extreme familiarity with the Unity platform, all without sacrificing an iota of speed in the frame rate. Even the control system again proves fit for purpose, despite a certain overcrowding of virtual keys that makes the product much more suitable for use on a tablet rather than a smartphone. In short, are we talking about the definitive multiplayer action game? Not exactly. Shadowgun: Deadzone is an open construction site in all respects, with the negative consequences of the case: lag (very) often reigns supreme, the application crashes or shows serious problems in match management, and even exclusive features of the premium account work in fits and starts. Again, the contents made available at the moment are rather limited: few maps, only two game modes -deathmatch and zone control- a not exactly exciting choice of skins and unlockable elements and no possibility to change the matchmaking parameters. Of course, it is still a free title and as such it must be evaluated, but for the moment we feel like rewarding the MADFINGER Games title more for its good intentions than for its effective implementation.", "date": "2012-12-04", "grade": "7.0"}
