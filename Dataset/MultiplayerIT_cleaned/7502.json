{"name": "America in fiamme", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/125283-call-of-duty-ghosts-america-in-fiamme.html", "text": "We talked about it extensively last week, on the occasion of the PlayStation 4 and ~current gen~ review, but now thanks to the code that has arrived in the editorial office we can express our opinion on the home computer of Call of Duty: Ghosts. Infinity Ward's new effort did not convince us enthusiastically, limping in what has always been its strengths, or rather a campaign - short, but still tense and exciting - and the multiplayer component which, despite being traditionally rich in content and very entertaining, it suffers from some small balance problems. But we must also underline that among the ~pros~ we find the two new inclusions that are decidedly spot on, namely the interesting asynchronous mode Squads and the tactical and cooperative adventure Extinction. A lot of material to evaluate, with many highs but also - and unfortunately! - lots of bass. Call of Duty: Ghosts fails to replicate the usual winning formula with the same success Yankees leave home The campaign is, bluntly, forgettable. Not that it's bankruptcy and unfunny, but it's little more than a not too well done, uninspiring homework, without those ~WOW moments!~ that have always distinguished the series. The single player sector, lasting between five and six hours if played on a normal difficulty level, makes us impersonate one of the two ~ghost~ brothers who with the progression will transform themselves from simple soldiers to the last bulwark of the United States against the army of the Federation, or all of South America united to annihilate the hated Yankees after the destruction (?!?) of the oil fields in the Middle East. Political fiction complete with space drift, when the ruthless brasileros board and use the Odin satellite, equipped with huge kinetic bars capable of unleashing a destruction equal to that of an atomic bomb, but without all those nuisances deriving from radiation. Eighteen short and fragmented missions for a classic, scripted and completely linear gameplay: we could almost say that the dog Riley has more freedom, since he spends all his time following someone. Nothing new for the franchise, but one really gets the impression of never being in charge, even if we are ghost novices and not expert war machines. The pace is good as usual, Infinity Ward stages a lot of variety both in terms of events and setting; there is everything expected of a Call of Duty, but for the first time, perhaps due to a setting and a characterization of the characters that certainly do not strike the player, there is little transport. Even those that in theory are configured as shocking twists do not leave their mark, assimilable in all respects to obligatory passages to get to the end of the story, complete with an obvious sub-final after the end credits. Even the story of a defeated and broken nation is completely missing, and what could be events all played in defense, with important consequences in terms of gameplay, turn out to be the usual Call of Duty missions. In short, there is a strong distance between what the characters tell us and what we actually play. Even the dog Riley gets lost a bit in this general greyness: he is a simple appearance in a couple of initial stealth missions, and then nothing more. A sort of cameo, rather than a full-fledged protagonist as much praised in the announcement phase. In terms of design, the developers have certainly not distorted the now standard canons: there is so much variety and there is no shortage of small gimmicks that refresh the usual routine a bit, but without a doubt originality is not exactly the strong point of this production. It must be said, however, that the pace is always very high and Infinity Ward has also successfully attempted to make the environments richer in vertical terms but certainly there are few memorable moments. The artificial intelligence stands at the usual levels: decidedly subdued, and even without meaningless movements, it hit us negatively for how it lets itself be hit in the open, or for how it doesn't know the meaning of the term cover. Here too everything is textbook, luckily the narrow spaces and the frenetic pace mask these deficiencies a little, but not too much. Lots to play The multiplayer is confirmed to be very rich in terms of offer, with over ten game modes, including old and new, and fourteen maps, many of which, probably the best of the lot, are decidedly large and open. In terms of mechanics, the customization of your soldier - or female soldier - takes place thanks to the union between the Point Streak system by class of Modern Warfare 3 and that of the Pick 10 of Black Ops 2, now declined on eight pointsyou only relate to the perks. Weapons, optics, grenades and even Strike Packages can all be equipped freely, provided you have the squad points that the game gives us sparingly when leveling up or completing missions. How to spend the points therefore becomes very important: if we want we can set them aside to immediately unlock the devastating (too much) Beretta ARX-160 assault rifle, but such a choice can actually drain our finances. Only the perks are obtained by leveling up, but in any case their purchase can be anticipated by paying precious points. Everything contributes to level up and the acquisition of squad points; we are therefore prompted to play Ghosts in its entirety by dissecting it properly. The three Strike Package specializations worked two years ago and still work today, but we ran into some balancing issues with some rewards. The dog, a reward for five kills of the assault class, kills enemies with a simple touch, and remains on the battlefield even if we are killed, accumulating further frags, while even the two types of Juggernaut seem a little too ~overpowered~ and the Specialist , without Strike Package, but equipped only with perks, can become a full-blown ninja in the hands of the most savvy players, equipping a total of over fifteen. But Infinity Ward's choice of player energy is something we struggle to understand. With very few hits you die, especially if fired from high-level weapons, which only exacerbates the problem of not always flawless respawns. A design choice strongly desired by Infinity Ward to distance itself from that of the opposite sign by Treyarch, but which can make games in which life expectancy is around a couple of seconds really frustrating, perhaps due to a cowardly blow to the back. In terms of new inclusions, we point out the goodness of the larger maps, which combine the DNA of the game, therefore frenzy and speed, with a layout that is no longer, or rather, not only labyrinthine, made up of large spaces, very open points of view, many raised areas, and as usual numerous defilements and passages towards the hot areas of the map. In this sense, the green valley of Stone Heaven is emblematic, complete with a ruined castle in the centre, full of hills, mounds and streams. But we must also mention Chasm, set in a Los Angeles devastated by the impacts of the Odin, structured on several levels, with a marked verticality and also very intricate and Whiteout, a good mix between long shots and areas for close combat, all played between a fishing village, small snowy hills, caves and tunnels around a wooded clearing perfect for crossfire. In this sense, the smaller maps lose a bit of bite compared to the large ones, even if objectively their level design is by no means contemptible. A (half) leap into the future Regarding the new game modes, many of the inclusions are spot on and can be understood as a valid alternative to the most played and loved ~classic~ ones. The most intriguing, ~tactical and reasoned~, but at the same time perfectly inserted in the canons of the franchise is Search and Rescue, or Search and Destroy hybridized with Kill Confirmed, while Blitz engages the two teams in a furious race towards the opposing base, where ~score~ by trampling on a small circular area and then being teleported to our base. But Hunted also seemed like a lot of fun to us, even if more of a pastime than a real competitive mode. We all start with a gun, we get more effective weapons thanks to crates that occasionally fall on the map: great races waiting for the new ~drop~, in short. Where the multiplayer sector is enhanced is in Extinction, a cooperative mode conceptually similar to Treyarch's Zombies, but with the focus placed on personalizing one's alter ego. It starts from the choice of class, between weapons specialist, tank, engineer and doctor, to then access a whole path of specialization and growth that changes both our performance and the contribution to teamwork. Everything revolves around the points that are earned wave after wave, that is, every time we destroy the alien nests that infest the freely explorable town. The choices that the game gives us are almost role-playing: do we specialize our character to the maximum or do we disperse the precious points in the various skills that are useful both to us and to the other players? Fun, frenetic but at the same time full of strategy and tactics, Extinction proves to be a happy novelty in the Call of Duty: Ghosts package. At cOncluing the game content is Squads, or rather a sort of asynchronous multiplayer where we have to create our own team moved by bots, carefully establishing the roles and the relative loadout, leveling it up by playing with it, but also and above all making so that it is chosen and used by the other players. All managed by an artificial intelligence on which Infinity Ward seems to have worked a lot since it is capable of adapting to our abilities and skills in real time. Squads proves to be an undoubtedly interesting new content, with the plus of the Safeguard mode (a horde enriched by random launches of weapons, perks and strike packages) but which must be evaluated in the long term to understand if the whole asynchronous mechanism of the teams. On a technical level, what is written in the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 review is valid. Call of Duty: Ghosts amply betrays its being a cross-gen title, which does not have all the potential of the best performing PCs to strike the player to the heart . Going up to 1080p and setting the graphic settings to the maximum means only enhancing the cleanliness of the images, practically eliminating artifacts and aliasing, but textures and attention to detail do not make you cry for a miracle. Greater attention to lighting and the application of effects such as tessellation are now practice in the home computer environment, and do not bring that plus to the image quality that the new consoles have benefited from. More generally, we are not dealing with an insufficient visual framework, but simply ~normal~, without particular peaks, even if to be honest the models of the protagonists are well cared for and above all well animated, thanks to the usual work done with a superlative motion capture. We must also point out that since the launch day there have been numerous problems that have affected the overall gaming experience, starting with numerous crashes before starting a multiplayer match. But what most disturbed PC users are the minimum six GB of RAM required to start the game, a decidedly high entry barrier and not justified by the results on the screen, without forgetting that an optimization that is not exactly state-of-the-art it made the game often inefficient even on very powerful machines, which can also suffer from memory management problems. Our advice is, in addition to updating the video card drivers, to work on the parameters, focusing a lot on terrain detail, motion blur and depth of field to increase the fluidity of the game. Even the hybrid system of dedicated and non-dedicated servers doesn't give the impression of being very performing. More generally, the wait for a corrective patch is very high, given the numerous stability problems affecting Call of Duty: Ghosts, but luckily something seems to be moving.", "date": "2013-11-11", "grade": "7.5"}
