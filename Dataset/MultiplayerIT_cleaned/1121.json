As mentioned, the game features a career mode that represents its core, beyond single races or challenges with friends. The goal is always the same: to win, bringing home trophies and glory, along a path that will make our alter-ego mature and that will allow us to drive ever more performing vehicles. Starting from scratch, with little money and little means available, we will have to participate in all the competitions to which we are admitted and sometimes complete specific tasks to earn money. If our conduct is impeccable, we will earn the esteem of the team and an agent will come knocking on our door to offer us a jump in category. Everything is ~told~ through a series of valuable animated sequences, seen from our character in the first person. The simulation component of the game is marked, so you will find yourself dealing with a control system that does not accept compromises and which requires a certain precision. Wrong trajectory can also prove fatal, given that the cars are damaged in a realistic way and there will be situations in which you will be left on foot due to the failure of some component. It is also possible to stop in the pits to repair what can be repaired, but only when the situation allows it Naturally, the complexity of driving is directly proportional to the power of the car, and from this point of view TOCA Race Driver 2 is equipped with a of learning fairly gradual, suitable for everyone. At the beginning, in fact, we will be able to control the vehicles at our disposal without particular problems, while at higher levels we will have to wisely dose the accelerator and the brake to face the most difficult curves without losing ground. [C] Cars were made using a large number of polygons. The classic replay is available at the end of each race. There are twelve types of vehicles available. [/C] Technical aspect The developers have used a rather powerful graphics engine, which manages to manage the large number of polygons with virtually no uncertainties and maintaining an excellent frame rate. The vehicles available, whether small or large, stand out for their great attention to detail and faithfully reproduce the original models, a fact which can also be seen thanks to the numerous views from which it is possible to choose. The tracks are located within sometimes fascinating scenarios, always characterized by numerous elements and an excellent level of detail, which helps to increase the sense of involvement in the racing. Even the damage to the bodywork was well represented graphically. In short, while not reaching the levels of Gran Turismo 4, the graphics of TOCA Race Driver 2 certainly cannot make one turn up one's nose, on the contrary it is one of the strengths of this product. As for the sound, the music does its job without disturbing, while the effects stand out for their quality and realism: sometimes it really seems to be in the middle of a race. Comment If Codemasters intended to differentiate its proposal in the field of racing games, on the one hand with Colin McRae Rally and on the other with TOCA, apparently it has succeeded. And successfully. TOCA Race Driver 2 is an excellent simulation, intelligently translated into reality both in terms of gameplay and technical aspect. So it is a candidate as a non-trivial alternative to GT4, with a certain depth and a level of variety that is difficult to overcome. Pros: Great graphics. Many different categories. Great career mode. Cons: Too many different categories? anonymous music. If England is the birthplace of Formula 1, a motor sport which for years has confirmed its intrinsically boring nature (see cars and circuits made specifically to prevent overtaking), in the USA there is a whole series of alternatives which make the show your main goal. Even at the expense of security, as is well known. TOCA Race Driver 2 puts us in the role of a driver who challenges twenty other daredevils around the world, aboard extremely powerful cars of all kinds, from custom-built cars to trucks The gameplay is decidedly devoted to simulation, so you can think of this new Codemasters title as a Gran Turismo 4 a little less beautiful to look at but full of substance. The numbers speak for themselves, after all: thirty-five vehicles, forty-eight tracks (the PS2 version has one more than the Xbox one) and an exciting career mode. [C] The graphics of the game are really convincing. You will find yourself driving all types of vehicles, even vintage cars.
