The debut on the App Store with Ravensword: The Fallen King was enthusiastically received by critics and the public, but in hindsight it is easy to hypothesize that much of the credit went above all to the lack of relevant alternatives in the Western RPG genre. Three years later, with more advanced technologies and vastly superior know-how, Crescent Moon Games brings iOS users back to the Ravensword universe with the direct sequel to The Fallen King. From the very first missions, we realize how Ravensword: Shadowlands is a much larger, more complete and technically superior game than the first chapter, but with the arrival of big names on the App Store and the ever-increasing expectations of those who play on the iPhone and iPad, are we sure it's enough? A ravenstone to bring them all... The narrative canvas of Shadowlands certainly does not stand out for its originality and desire to dare: the player is catapulted into the kingdom of Tyreas half a century after the events narrated in The Fallen King, this time in the role of the only survivor of the bloody War of Heronmar. Thinking of a stroke of luck would be too easy, and so the protagonist sets off on an adventure in an attempt to find out why, fundamentally, he has not died. A few minutes and the archmage on duty sends the user to search for the Ravenstones, relics that are hidden in every corner of the kingdom and that show the way that leads to the legendary sword Ravensword. Predictably you make your way through a series of quests and side missions glued together by magical powers and ancient prophecies, but all only after creating your own alter-ego with an editor very similar to that of the latest The Elder Scrolls. As soon as you leave the city of Aven and start traveling in the Overworld it is clear that one of the main objectives of the developers was to offer a much wider experience than that had in The Fallen King and Aralon. The progress can be seen above all in the number and variety of settings present, but unfortunately you are never faced with really elaborate dungeons, and overall you never shake off the feeling of following a very linear path. The problem is the lack of surprises and unforeseen events to encounter while moving from one place to another: there are relatively few hidden places and many areas are nothing more than desolate wastes with a few rare creatures left here and there. Let me be clear, from time to time you come across effective panoramas and the overall visual impact is very good, but the fluctuating textures are accompanied by a very annoying pop-in effect. ...and in the bug chain them In short, compared to the first Ravensword, Shadowlands is larger and more sumptuous, with the player who can customize the character's specialization both through the skill tree and by distributing experience points to improve its characteristics. Furthermore, as in The Elder Scrolls, the ability to fight with a type of weapon increases the more you use it, and the same goes for spells, for parries or for stealthy movements. The possibility of deciding with a certain freedom whether to enhance physical strength, constitution, health or vigor was one of the main shortcomings of the first Ravensword, and it is appreciable how Crescent Moon Games wanted to listen to the enthusiasts and run for cover. What leaves you speechless, however, is the way in which the developers seem to have ignored all the remaining criticisms received by The Fallen King. Once again, orienting yourself in the kingdom of Tyreas is far from easy: the map only gives general indications and in some cases, above all because of not very visible passages, you end up going around in circles without being able to find the correct path. The combat system is not very engaging and is limited to the continuous pressure of the attack button: consuming energy with each slash and each spell requires a minimum of strategy, but all is rendered useless by a mediocre artificial intelligence. In some cases, enemy creatures can't even get close to the player, getting stuck if there's a particular obstacle in the way, making them an easy target for arrows and fireballs. It's a huge shame, especially since the development team tried to create different exciting situations, such as battling a herd of huge dinosaurs in a swamp, stabbing fights on the rooftops ofa city or the chance to ride a pterodactyl. Although the latest update has fixed some problems and introduced the ability to customize the controls, Ravensword: Shadowlands is still a crude game full of small and big problems, starting from the cumbersomeness in collecting loot to the inability to introduce the player to many key elements, such as the enhancement of objects through runes or the need to feed in order not to receive temporary penalties.", "date": "2013-01-10", "grade": "7.0"}
