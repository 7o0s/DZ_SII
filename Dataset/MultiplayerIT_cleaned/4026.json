Released on Steam last December, Fire Pro Wrestling World is now also available on PS4, both in physical and digital format, and is ready to project us back into the folds of time again. Well, after having had the opportunity to dissect the contents of the conversion, here is the verdict in our review. A gameplay based on slaps and a lot of timing Fire Pro Wrestling World stays true to the typical gameplay of the series. In keeping with tradition, the game offers a type of wrestling of greater substance than the spectacular but not very concrete one we have been accustomed to following the North American scene. For his part, Spike Chunsoft preferred not to distort his traditionalist approach and grabbed some official licenses of Japanese professional wrestling, including the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The proposed mechanics are substantially the same that characterized the old chapters of the series dating back to the eras of the PC Engine, the Super Famicom or the SEGA Saturn. If you still have doubts about it, know that the philosophy followed by this production is openly ~old school~. Yes, because in Fire Pro Wrestling the difficulty in approaching matches also comes from the complete absence of a user interface that can provide precise information regarding the current status of your wrestler. Obviously this speech also applies to the opponent that we find ourselves facing. During each game you have to do your best in order to find the correct balance between attack phases and defense situations, or those moments in which it is essential to try to get away from your opponent for a few moments and catch your breath. Neglecting this factor means exposing yourself in a few moments to the vehemence of the enemy on duty, who will not hesitate to take advantage of a dull moment to strike hard. Complicating things is precisely the presence of stamina, and the fact that it cannot be evaluated by consulting an indicator on the screen. It therefore becomes crucial to act on instinct, trying to guess when it's time to take a break and when vice versa it is the opponent who is clearly in oxygen debt. Three front buttons are linked to the management of the different types of attack (Weak, Medium and Heavy), while the fourth is used to manage the stroke, which is particularly useful especially when you want to take advantage of the ropes that delimit the ring. With a wide range of holds and submission moves, which also change in relation to the specific qualities of each character, the variety of alternatives made available to the player is particularly wide, but also requires some practice to be mastered sufficiently. On the other hand, it is appropriate to highlight all the limitations revealed by the collisions, which force the player to optimize the number of shots and their strategy as much as possible in order not to risk completely missing most of the attacks. The difficulties already arise during the brawling phases, and it is precisely in these situations that the dosage of the moves to be performed can make the difference between triumph and defeat. After receiving a good dose of slaps and a barrage of German suplexes, powerbombs and so on and so forth, you begin to enter the perspective of having to dose your enthusiasm with less offensive solutions but more aimed at achieving the goal the final. In this sense, timing acquires a fundamental value, especially when it comes to tackling holds. It is precisely in these situations that the rapid pressing of one of the attack buttons, as soon as the animation has started, is the only method by which the chosen move can be carried out. The difference is above all practice - combined with a healthy dose of patience - even if it must be said that the presence of an extensive tutorial, structured in fifty missions, comes to the rescue to allow the player to refine his style and reduce the margins of error. What Fire Pro Wrestling World does not save on are above all the game modes available, able to guarantee a wide freedom of choice for all true wrestling fans. The normal exhibition alternates with the inevitable tournaments and even the Battle Royale, where only one participant is destined to get the better of all the others. In each of these categories one can lean towards a rich grange of alternatives, from the traditional match to the one inside the cage, from the Barbed Wire match with electrified wires instead of the ropes that delimit the ring, to fights in the MMA-style octagon, just to name a few. The news of the new chapter The lack of the most famous licenses could make some users turn up their noses, also due to the fact that the New Japan Pro Wrestling league is not particularly renowned in the West. Nonetheless, the situation is counterbalanced by one of the main innovations foreseen in this new episode of the series, or the wrestlers editor. Thanks to the new tools implemented by the development studio - and incidentally already thoroughly tested by the buyers of the PC version - Fire Pro Wrestling World allows you to customize the appearance and characteristics of the existing roster, but above all to shape new protagonists by setting parameters such as the external appearance , the colors of the costumes, the fighting style and more generally all the data necessary to accurately outline the characteristics that that wrestler will have once he enters the ring. The patch available from day one also introduced the ~Fire Pro Net~ feature, which allows the public to share their wacky creations with the rest of the community. The new chapter of Fire Pro Wrestling is also the first ever to offer an online multiplayer mode, making it possible to face other players in one of the many modes that we listed in the previous paragraph. Participating in random encounters alternates with the option of creating a new room and waiting for new challengers to join the game. Contrary to the PC edition, where the local multiplayer mode involved up to a maximum of eight players at a time, the PS4 conversion allows you to take part in a local match only in the company of three other friends at the same time. During our test we found some annoying flaws in the management of online battles: in fact, it was often difficult to find other users to challenge, and on the occasions when we managed to enter a game we had to deal with annoying problems of lag. The third novelty implemented by Spike Chunsoft in Fire Pro Wrestling World concerns the addition of the Fighting Road mode, a sort of offline adventure in which you take part in a career as a young athlete, with the ultimate goal of reaching the top and capture the IWGP league belt. In this case the meetings alternate with a series of dialogues that draw inspiration from the visual novels, even if on several occasions the screens have proved to be very slow to view, as well as quite superfluous to follow.", "date": "2018-10-05", "grade": "6.8"}
