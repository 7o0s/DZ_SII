{"name": "World War Z", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-war-z-recensione.html", "text": "World War Z has some great moments, in particular those that testify to the Swarm Engine's ability to move thousands of zombies on the screen, seemingly endless hordes that crowd like a swarm on walls and networks in order to climb over them and run in our direction. while from behind a fixed turret or with standard equipment we try to thin out the ranks. These are situations that quite faithfully follow the sequences of the film with Brad Pitt, underlining how that was clearly the main inspiration of Saber Interactive; although from the point of view of the structure and the mechanics the game is quite derivative, a child in some ways more sophisticated but less charismatic than the classic Left 4 Dead. On the positive side, the authors did not want to deceive users in any way, indeed the sale price of 39.99 euros confirms the good intentions of the development team and is fundamentally adequate for an offer that includes four different settings ( New York, Moscow, Jerusalem and Tokyo) for a total of eleven missions playable in online cooperative for four participants or in single player, with the support of bots. To support the duration of the campaign, which in itself can be completed in five or six hours, there are not only the inevitable difficulty levels, but also and above all a rich progression system that allows you to unlock new skills for each of available classes, buy more powerful weapons and even view narrative sequences that illustrate the background of each of the playable characters. That's not all: in support of the co-op we also find a set of competitive multiplayer modes for eight players, not unforgettable but fun to try, also equipped with an independent progression. Structure As written at the beginning, it is impossible to talk about World War Z without mentioning the many points that the Saber Interactive title has in common with the dear old Left 4 Dead. We are dealing with a third person shooter rather than a first person shooter, it is true, but beyond this the solutions adopted for the cooperative campaign are tremendously similar: we move within more or less large scenarios, more or less successful (the Japanese one is in fact very evocative thanks to its particular colors), the waves of undead are repelled and there are the traditional moments in which you have to activate a switch that will make numerous zombies fall on the spot, asking us to resist for a few minutes before being able to flee to a safe place. There are even special enemies, those who imprison the player in a vice from which it is possible to be freed only thanks to the intervention of his companions: large policemen in riot gear, very fast mutants who jump on us and call the living dead together until we eliminate them, and zombies that hide a large amount of poisonous gas inside a hazmat suit. It is a pity that the authors have not managed to go beyond these well-established elements, introducing new situations that could add a little personality to a product that is enjoyable precisely because it is so derivative, a technically updated version of the Valve-branded shooter but tainted by problems that undoubtedly have to do with the project budget and which revolve around the finishing: some quite showy glitches, some uncertainty in the frame rate. Gameplay It shoots well in World War Z, although there was room to further improve the rendering of impacts. The arsenal is very large and the fact of being able to grow it through the use of points earned in battle undoubtedly adds depth to a progression system that has very little to be forgiven. The characters are also managed here as simple skins, different depending on the scenario for a total of sixteen survivors, each with a narrative background that can be viewed in the form of a cutscene after completing any scenario. The six classes change, each characterized by a basic equipment and a tree of peculiar skills: the Gunslinger is balanced and versatile, the Devastator knows how to have fun with explosives, the Medic is the traditional support unit, the Mechanic is a resource expert, the Butcher specializes in melee attacks and finally the Exterminator favors heavy weapons. Then there is the arsenal itself, which as mentioned can be improved by spending experience points earned in the field: shotguns or sniper rifles, light machine guns, assault rifles, pistols and weapons.before other variants available in different versions, more or less powerful and more or less precise. Once a specific model has been unlocked, it is what we will then find in the scenarios with the possibility of picking it up and changing the setup, composed by default of a main and a secondary weapon to which grenades and a large machete are possibly added, essential for exterminating zombies that have come upon us or eliminate the first enemies of the stage silently, without alerting the horde. Even on the front of melee tools, however, there is a fair choice and it often happens that you come across a large chainsaw with which to literally tear apart the waves of undead. The controls support the system in a not entirely effective way, in the sense that a certain delay is felt in the response to certain inputs (the weapon change, for example) and it is not clear whether it could depend on the latency of the online sessions, which suffer from a few hiccups too many but they always remain playable. The layout of the keys takes up classic solutions (reload on Square, run by pressing the left stick on its base, change weapon on Triangle, aim and fire on the left and right triggers) and therefore you can play immediately with great peace of mind, without the need for tutorials or particular introductions. When the traditional wave of zombies is about to start, a time limit is indicated within which to make all the necessary preparations, therefore reload the ammunition at the crates within the map and possibly collect and arrange stationary machine guns, electrified traps, barbed wire and mortars with which to substantially thin out the horde. However, it is a pity that these tower defense-style aspects have not been developed in a more significant way, leaving the player free to decide how and where to place objects. The competitive multiplayer modes In addition to the co-op campaign, World War Z features five eight-player competitive multiplayer modes: Horde Domination, King of the Hill, Horde Deathmatch, Procurement, and Vaccine Hunt. They all see two teams made up of four users competing in some fairly sized maps, taken from the main scenarios, but with the variable made up of the inevitable zombies, who can break into the scenario and complicate life for users. Many of the modes are based on elements of territory control and are therefore a bit too similar, however it must be recognized that including five different options was not at all obvious and at the moment it is possible to find a good number of players online to be able to play matches. The authors have also introduced a separate progression system, with ten classes to choose from. In the end, the competitive sector doesn't add who knows what to the value of the Saber Interactive title, but it's nice that it exists. Playstation 4 trophies World War Z includes a total of thirty-six Trophies, including Platinum. The basic achievements are unlocked simply by completing the various scenarios at any level of difficulty, after which there are the actions related to numbers (for example ~kill 10,000 zombies~) and those related to the progression system (for example ~unlock the final version of a weapon~). Technical realization If the goal of World War Z was to recall the most spectacular scenes of the film of the same name, we can say that the developers have managed to hit it. Undoubtedly thanks to the Swarm Engine, which, as mentioned, manages to manage thousands of zombies simultaneously on the screen and faithfully reproduce their behavior, see for example when the enemies ~pile up~ in a way that is as rapid as it is disturbing to scale the surfaces. On consoles, this show of decomposing limbs has to be satisfied with 30 frames per second that are not always stable, spoiled by some drops which, however, fortunately, do not affect the enjoyment of the gunplay. The characters of the team have a discreet design and a set of animations that have not been sacrificed on the altar of the netcode, while on the scenario front, the desire to get out of generic solutions and give a minimum of personality to the settings is perceived : an effort that in some cases we can say was quite successful, in other cases not. The matchmaking system is currently quite fast and effective, a sign that there are many online users available for a game: perhaps the budget price and the reference to the brand, but above all the absence of a valid and recent alternative to the highly cited Left 4 Dead have made inroads among fans of cooperative shooters. There are some things about the interface that leave a little to be desired (for example, there is no shortcut to silencea noisy companion), but for the most part everything works surprisingly well and any graphical glitches don't translate into actual latency for the gameplay, which is the most important thing. Finally, as regards the sound sector, unfortunately it seemed to us essential and devoid of acute notes, unable to make the most of the apocalyptic scenes that characterize the game.", "date": "2019-04-22", "grade": "7.2"}
