Which is not necessarily a bad thing, given that World of Final Fantasy was a great game and, not having to count on a glittering technical framework, but still in step with the times, the transition from PlayStation 4 to PC proved to be decidedly painless. The game is almost identical to how we remembered it, except for a few small details that made us frown. The worlds of Square Enix For those who missed our coverage last year, it is worth noting that World of Final Fantasy is an episode unrelated to the Final Fantasy series, also because Square Enix has taken a new path for the occasion: that of Pokmon clones. The protagonists of this story are two brothers who suddenly find themselves involved in a great adventure: having lost their memories, Reyn and Lann will have to capture the ~mirages~ scattered throughout the world of Grymoire, creatures taken directly from the Final Fantasy universe such as the chocobos or malboros that our people can use in combat. The various mirages have different sizes that tactically affect the composition of the group during the fights. In fact, the largest mirages can carry Reyn, Lann and smaller creatures above their heads. The two brothers can also change shape and transform themselves from ~jiganti~ into ~lilichini~, shrunken and cute versions that can ride the biggest mirages. Each ~stack~, then, adds up the stats and abilities of the mirages that make it up, including elemental resistances and other RPG metrics. World of Final Fantasy is a very simple game only in appearance, as it hides a considerable depth that becomes evident especially towards the end of the game and in the secret areas to be explored in search of every secret. The player can choose whether to articulate the fights in turn or in real time, using a variant of the Active Time Battle adopted in various Final Fantasy and also changing the interface at any time, perhaps preferring a more classic one to the default stylized one. Every time we have to act on one of our piles, we will be able to choose which skill to use, whether to heal our heroes or whether to imprint our opponents, capturing them and adding them to our Miraggiario, a sort of encyclopedia that also allows us to enhance mirages, unlocking their skills with points earned in battle and even evolving them into bigger and more menacing creatures. Although it is important to face the most difficult enemies with a pinch of strategy, it is important to specify that the story and dialogues of World of Final Fantasy rarely take themselves seriously, being full of more or less successful jokes and quotes: in this sense, the spin -off by Square Enix is above all a beautiful love letter for true fans of the series, but also a kind of introductory JRPG for those who have never tried their hand at the genre. In the thirty hours needed to complete the adventure you will find all the clichs of the genre, from evil forces who want to destroy the world to mysterious masked individuals, through painful memories, dramatic moments and above all great outbursts of humor and gags a profusion. The conversion for PC As we said at the beginning, the PC version of World of Final Fantasy does not differ in a particular way from the PlayStation 4 version, both for better or for worse: in fact, the game only runs at 30 frames per second and Square Enix has not even deigned to implement a menu that allows you to customize the appearance of the title which, moreover, and curiously, starts in window mode. To change some visual parameters such as the general resolution, the resolution of the shadows or the post-processing value, you need to call up a special window from the Steam interface and then set these few, sparse options as you like. It's very little and the game, as beautiful as it is to look at thanks also to the excellent artistic direction, suffers a bit from this shortage of possibilities, especially if we calculate that a year has passed since the original release: fortunately, the experience was reproduced in full from every other point of view and in the hours we spent with this conversion we did not notice any bugs or technical problems worthy of note. Therefore, it is not explained why Square Enix has completely neglected the possibility of customizing the graphics of the PC version but has taken care to implement in the game itself a series of brand new items that allow you to deactivatere random encounters or make gil and summons in combat infinite. World of Final Fantasy isn't even a particularly difficult game, so it goes without saying that the addition of cheats made us turn up our noses a bit. Obviously they are completely optional alterations that we dispassionately advise you to ignore, unless you have already played the original title and want to complete it again at full speed without giving too much weight to the role-playing aspect. It would be a great pity, but the choice is up to you.", "date": "2017-11-28", "grade": "8.0"}
