{"name": "Super Monkey Ball 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-monkey-ball-2_a.html", "text": "I Cheeta you Sega Given the large following that the first episode of Sega's monkey series obtained, a sequel was therefore highly predictable; said-done, Amusement Vision immediately got back to work, trying to fill the gaps and correct the defects that had been detected. Super Monkey Ball 2 is therefore, on balance, exactly what one would have expected: far from wanting to bring gusts of innovation, the programmers have packaged a product in some ways close to the qualification of data disk, going to polish and expand the elements already present in the past. As for the main single-player game mode, the Japanese team has decided to extend the offer by adding a brand new story mode to the challenge mode, in all respects similar to that of the first episode. However, the differences are far from striking, as well as questionable from various points of view: above all, in fact, the story mode completely eliminates the appearance of game over, offering the player the possibility of continuing without any limitation of lives. As easily deducible, this decision brings a drastic drop in the level of frustration, but also an equally drastic collapse of the tension that made Monkey Ball so popular and intriguing. Furthermore, the events narrated through short sequences between one level and another, although they rightly want to fit into the cartoon and ~childish~ spirit of the series, are of such a marked banality and paucity as to make them boring, if not downright irritating. Fortunately, the challenge mode brings things back to their original appearance thus effectively making the story mode nothing more than a rather useless ~more~, all the more so considering that the levels are the same anyway. From a technical point of view, the improvements of this second episode range from imperceptible to discreet depending on the settings. Nonetheless, due to the graphic style adopted by the Japanese graphics, these minimal differences certainly do not leave a bad taste in the mouth; after all, from such a title we certainly don't expect that the GameCube will be squeezed to the last drop, but rather that it will be able to convey a certain feeling between the demented and the psychedelic. And, from this point of view, the objective has been fully achieved. Different speech instead for the sound, far too poor in both quality and quantity: an extra effort would have been definitely welcome. Yesterday I went home with the monkey By designing the new levels, divided into ten worlds made up of ten units each, Amusement Vision decided to give new meanings to the word ~madness~. Excluding the initials, simple stages in fact, Super Monkey Ball 2 is all about the appearance of ramps, loops, loops, very steep descents, winding paths, bumpers, and so on and so forth. If you thought that the first episode was already architecturally daring, think again: facing some situations of Sega production can leave even the most experienced of gamers thrilled. On closer inspection, however, in this level design orgy, he can understand on some occasions seeing the balance that was so much appreciated in the first chapter move away. For heaven's sake, Super Monkey Ball 2 offers a decidedly progressive and sweet learning curve, but once you reach the more complex levels, the idea that you have exaggerated a bit can flash; this even more so when one realizes that, more than skill, in some cases luck is the determining factor for reaching the goal. Closed this parenthesis, it only remains to talk about the subgames studied by Amusement Vision: as fans of the first chapter are well aware, they are not reduced to a mere addition to the single mode, but represent a real main aspect within the playful offer of Sega production. And so, together with the 6 minigames present in Super Monkey Ball, 6 more have been added; among these, the reproductions of Tennis and Football undoubtedly stand out, obviously with the ubiquitous encapsulated monkeys as protagonists. Although not all of them can boast the same quality level, the subgames represent an excellent aspect of the Amusement Vision effort which in fact makes Super Monkey Ball an extremely valid title both in single and in multiplayer. Which, you will agree, is an absolutely respectable merit. Comment Super Monkey Ball 2 is a sequel that gratifies without surprising: far from risking affecting such a widely successful formula, the Sega programmers have opted for a fine job, correcting and expanding the aspects already present in the first episode. For thatthis reason, the title of Amusement Vision will certainly appeal to the admirers of the previous chapter, but with the same certainty it will not change the mind of those who have not been infected by monkey-mania at all. Ultimately therefore, although not perfect, Super Monkey Ball 2 is a very thick title whose purchase undoubtedly deserves to be at least taken into consideration. Pros: Extremely fun and exciting Well structured and extremely varied Technically more than good Cons: Few substantial differences compared to the prequel Definitely questionable story mode Bad sound Some levels a bit too extreme Appearing for the first time in the last months of 2001, Super Monkey Ball was one of Sega's greatest ~original~ successes of recent years, where by original we mean not being part of the decidedly vast category of sequels and spin-offs. The gameplay, as simple as it is original, was undoubtedly the triggering element of what was a real monkey-mania: the purpose of the game created by Amusement Vision was in fact to control a sphere, within which it was enclosed one of the available primates, until she crosses a finish line located on the opposite side of the setting. In reality, rather than moving the ball, the player had control over the entire playing surface which, by leaning in the direction indicated by the directional stick, was able to produce the rolling of the ball. Nothing easier then? Quite the contrary: if in fact the first levels represented a simple formality, on the contrary, continuing in the game we were faced with authentic parts of evil minds. Being able to reach the colorful ribbon therefore became a challenge to the last centimetre, always with the lurking risk of an unwelcome leap into the void.", "date": "2003-04-29", "grade": null}
