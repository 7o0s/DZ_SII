The bad things are that for script requirements they have transformed you into a cyborg (and this will perhaps prejudice a little social relations with the opposite sex..), the good things are instead that you have become a kind of destructive Terminator, endowed with a scary fire and a six million dollar view!! In C-12, in addition to dealing with aliens and robots, you will have to carry out specific missions and solve classic puzzles such as ~move the chest, climb on it, lower the switches to open the door~... Your bionic eye will be of great help with which you can subjectively inspect the surrounding environment at any time (by pressing R2) and which will provide you with valuable information on everything you frame (in my opinion this is the real gem of the game, together with the aiming system that automatically locks onto the target ). What you will see and what you will hear. The graphics of C-12 are well made, especially the textures and light effects, perhaps already seen but always fascinating. The gloomy post-atomic style atmosphere is rendered really well, as you can see from the images around here. Our hero is well made and well animated in the myriad of movements he can make. Your amusing arsenal of weapons ranges from a strange alien blade to a thermonuclear cannon. The city has a really vast map, graphically rich in 3D even if we must denounce a sporadic ~disappearance of polygons~ in certain shots, which in any case does not affect playability. The sound is damn good, the music does its job, remaining low while you play but with an atmosphere; explosions and special effects are of high quality, as well as the speech totally in Italian, made impeccably, which in a game of this type characterizes and enhances a lot (see Metal Gear ..). In short, is there or does it? The thing that bothered me a bit (the only one) is the sometimes inaccurate graphics that deceive. Let me explain.. In a game where exploration matters a lot, I hate seeing passages that turn out to be fake, for example loopholes between walls, which you could easily enter but.. where you weren't expected to pass through. Here, in my opinion this is an element that unnerves a bit: if I can't pass, plug that hole I say .. (maybe I'm being fussy but I love ~Snake~ which can even slip under a bedside table). Personal considerations aside, C-12 certainly remains a good product that squeezes the Psone to the maximum, it is nothing super-innovative but if you love the genre, take it without hesitation ... it will entertain your desire for destruction (... videogame of course). In short, is there or does it? Pros: Fun Playability and high longevity Cons: Some flaws on the game structure C-12 final resistance: the resistance of the Playstation Psone doesn't give up, indeed SCEE and Studio Cambridge (those of Medievil) have prepared a new 3D shooter in the ~Siphon Filter~ style with a setting halfway between Alien and Akira-type manga, seasoned with a plot full of intrigues .", "date": "2001-04-11", "grade": null}
