{"name": "Street Fighter EX3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-fighter-ex3.html", "text": "Is 3 dimensions better than 2? The Ex series was introduced a few years ago on Playstation in an attempt to add Capcom's most famous fighting game to the ranks of polygonal fighting games that were literally depopulating on the old Sony console. SFEX was to all intents and purposes a strictly two-dimensional mechanical title in which the third D only served to give a tone to the environment with its shot changes, fluid animations, various light effects around the super moves. After a continuation under the banner of not much more of the same, it seemed that Arika had little else to say on the subject, this until Playstation 2 entered the field, one of the very first titles announced was in fact the third chapter of the apocryphal saga of Street Fighter. The screenshots released suggested an excellent technical realization... how wrong we were! Is 128 bit better than 32? The first visual impact with Street Fighter Ex 3 is daunting, the subsequent ones make you regret the hundred paid out. The sensation is that of being faced with a Dreamcast game, one of the bad ones I mean, we are around Virtua Fighter 3tb, which among other things beats SFEX3 in many respects. The style used in making the wrestlers is somewhat detestable: the proportions are wrong (squat bodies, Zangief's big head...) but not to the point of suggesting the super deformed as a stylistic choice. All in all, the polygons are few. The textures are of a unique sloppiness. Nothing good seems to come even from the backdrops that don't even look like real 3d, it looks more like a parallax effect applied on an invisible dome that encloses the playing area (it's a bit difficult to explain, I hope you get the idea) . Everything else seems to have not changed from previous versions of the game: the animations, the music ... a shame. Something to report regarding the game modes: the presence of the Tag Team is certainly appreciated with the possibility of including the defeated in your squad. Also interesting are the one-on-three clashes and the mode (similar to the Career in UFC) in which you will have to train a character who is rather fast in martial arts until he becomes a tough nut to crack Concluding... You will hardly play SFEX3 for a long time, unless you have number one two three friends with whom to let off steam in furious Tag Matches in which, however, the feeling of being playing one of the two PS1 prequels run on your flaming console will never go away new generation. Brrr... pros: charm of the saga exciting multiplayer challenges cons: not perfect graphics always the same soup... Dura Lex sed Lex In this frenetic world of precooked food, casual relationships and exposure to uranium 238, it can sometimes happen that we forget to review a game at the time of its release. Sorry, in these cases it is imperative to remedy with a nice posthumous review. In fact, the risk is that of leaving interesting titles, real jewels, on the back burner. Mh, that's certainly not the case with this SFEX3, a truly horrible product... the comment goes at the end...", "date": "2001-03-29", "grade": null}
