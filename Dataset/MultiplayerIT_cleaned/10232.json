{"name": "Comandante Shepard", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73992-mass-effect-2-comandante-shepard-agli-ordini.html", "text": "Version tested: PC and Xbox 360BioWare closed last year with Dragon Age: Origins, a true tribute to old-school RPGs, steeped in statistics and fantasy settings. A sumptuous game, appreciated by many precisely for the recovery of a tradition that is increasingly rarely brought back to life in today's games. After a few weeks, the same software house offers the sequel to one of its most successful titles of recent years, distancing itself very clearly from that newly glorified tradition, and continuing the road that leads to innovation in video game narrative . Mass Effect 2 is the work of a team that seems to have listened very carefully to the criticisms leveled at the first chapter and is an exciting adventure that few should pass up. Orders Commander! The adventure of Commander Shepard, if desired, picks up exactly where it left off with the first chapter, after the meeting with the Destroyers and the infernal battle that broke out on the Citadella, seat of the Council, a body that brings together government representatives of all races of the galaxy. After a series of events, which we don't have the heart to tell, and after an encounter that radically marks the protagonist's life, the Commander's task will be to set up a crew capable of facing an epic and exciting battle. Those who still keep the save from the first episode can begin this new chapter enjoying the consequences deriving from the choices made previously, which contributes significantly to increasing the degree of identification with the science fiction universe set up by BioWare. Mass Effect 2 however, is perfectly enjoyable even by those who have never dealt with the Normandy crew, the story will simply move from a basic plot chosen by the team, even if inevitably only those who have already gone through the emotional experience of the first chapter you will be able to fully appreciate some passages, especially those that have to do with the return of the old key characters. These, in a couple of cases, leave their place on the Normandy to other supporting actors who are simply fantastic, with, above all, Miranda, Jack and the assassin Thane who inevitably fascinate in the quests dedicated to them. In fact, the narrative structure has taken even more the trend of a modern television series (many quotes from the famous Lost) with the result of being able to tell the personality and character of the protagonists with a depth that had never been seen in a video game, especially considering the number of characters the writers had to dedicate themselves to. The choices available to the player, always oriented towards the alternation of noble or evil attitudes, are innumerable and have such consequences that, unless you get lost in completing each quest and obtaining each upgrade, two different games will hardly lead to two finals identical. Always with the option to carry your save back to the next installment of the saga, further increasing the ramifications of the story, assuming you manage to survive the final battle. Something less and so much more Narrative aside, where Mass Effect 2 breaks free from the RPG tradition is in the choices made by BioWare to make the gaming experience enjoyable to an even wider audience. The most disruptive is that of the elimination of the inventory: where in the first chapter hours were spent changing weapons to the characters and selling all the accumulated objects that filled the equipment slots, here there is a shared heritage, made up of the different types of weapons and upgrades, which become immediately available to all protagonists compatible with them, as soon as they are synthesized in the laboratory of the Normandy. Now, in fact, it is not a question of opening chests to collect dozens of weapons, but of exploring the seabed to find the projects necessary to create the objects to strengthen the crew and the spaceship. The minerals must be recovered by scanning the surfaces of the planets that make up the galaxy, among which we move in what resembles a sort of World Map of Final Fantasy in an interstellar key, complete with fuel consumption and probes necessary to extract the metals. It is in these phases that some of the hidden secondary missions come out, with the total abandonment of the exploration sections of the surfaces of the first episode aboard the Mako, the jeep capable of rising for short flight sections, a real heel d'Achilles for the repetitiveness that characterized them. ToOnce a destination has been identified, it finds itself directly projected into an area to explore and into the heart of the action, guaranteeing ever-changing situations and fairy-tale settings, where in the first Mass Effect it was a repetition of all the same rooms and deserts of endless pebbles. The elevators in which it was necessary to stop for whole minutes waiting for the backgrounds and textures of the new areas to be updated have also disappeared, even if the loading screens that replaced them are in some cases quite long. In addition to this renewed variety of situations and settings, what gives depth to the game is a much more precise balance of the different classes and a clearer differentiation between them, which forces a much more careful choice of powers to be developed and, above all, companions to take on the various missions. The PC version Mass Effect 2 is undoubtedly excellent from a technical and graphic point of view already on Xbox 360 and the transposition on PC can only enjoy a further improved visual aspect. Perhaps this contributes slightly to highlighting the somewhat sterile settings which in part clash when compared with the incredible quality of the character models. However, everything manages to blend perfectly thanks also to excellent management of the lights both indoors and outdoors. It should also be noted that in the PC version, compared to the Xbox 360 version, they are even more optimized and tend to be practically non-existent, while support for the Xbox 360 pad has not been implemented. A rather unjustifiable choice but in line with what has already been done with Dragon Age: Origins. Finally, it is crucial to underline again, as already done during the review, that Mass Effect 2 is extremely cleaned up of RPG elements and this could have an impact that should not be underestimated for the player who played the prequel on PC and therefore expects a management of the characters at least slightly more in-depth than the Xbox 360 version. Unlike what was done with the first Mass Effect, this sequel is in all respects identical between the two versions starting from the commands to get right to the organization of the supporting actors ( forget the action queues) and this could cause some discontent for those who may have become too accustomed to BioWare's other masterpiece, Dragon Age: Origins. Xbox 360 goals Of the thousand points made available by Mass Effect 2, more than 500 are easily obtainable already on the first pass and by finishing the adventure on the normal difficulty level. Sure we're still talking about 30 hours of gameplay, but we doubt it will be a problem to give up on the venture. To get to 1000 it is necessary to finish it a second time at least and dedicate yourself to the exploration of the deepest space. Changes One of the aspects on which it is evident that the team has worked more carefully is the mapping of the controls, in order to make the gaming experience even more fluid and enjoyable. The player-controlled party is still composed of three elements, only this time the thrown weapons have been eliminated, thus freeing up two buttons on the joypad and allowing three of Captain Shepard's special powers to be executed immediately, and one for each of the others two crew members, drastically reducing the need to resort to the power selection screen. This means that now most of the fights take place in real time, thanks also to a much more intuitive pointing system, which, combined with the finally optimal fluidity of the graphics engine, makes the action phases of the same level as the game parts. exploration, giving life to a package that as a whole can only leave you amazed by the quality and care placed in all aspects, from level design to the smallest details. The locations are really many, if you think that it took us more than thirty hours to complete the game, almost without lingering on the secondary quests, and finding ourselves faced with ever-changing settings. Mass Effect 2 is still moved by an optimized version of the Unreal Engine, but with stunning results that represent one of the peaks reached in this generation of hardware, with some memorable settings and with the characters that have reached an even higher level of detail, with even fewer problems than the original, if we exclude some problems related to the protagonist Shepard who got stuck in the seabed on a couple of occasions, forcing us to reload the last checkpoint reached. Honorable mention, once again, to the sound accompaniment which, between effects, voices and music, fills the ears of those who play for hours. Even the dubbing, strictly in Italyno like the subtitles it is of excellent quality with the return of the voices that characterized the first chapter, with the exception of the protagonist Shepard. In fact, the voice actor Claudio Moneta, after recording about 80% of the speech, fell victim to an accident that forced him to stay in hospital for a long time, making it impossible for him to complete the work. In haste and fury he was then replaced by Giacomo Zito whose vocal timbre is similar and equally pleasant.", "date": "2010-01-26", "grade": "9.5"}
