The tested version is the one for Nintendo Wii. Started simply as a mini-game included in Project Gotham Racing 2 for Xbox, Geometry Wars has experienced a truly unusual crescendo for a title born so quietly: after being ~refreshed~ on Live Arcade with the Retro Evolved version, the work Bizarre it was later ported to mobile and PC, reappeared in Project Gotham Racing 4 under the subtitle Waves, and now comes to Wii. Let's see if the hardcore gameplay of Geometry Wars: Galaxies will have been able to marry with the casual nature of the Nintendo console... Destructive geometry As mentioned, Kuju has attempted to flesh out the original structure with new elements, indeed with not always exciting results. Geometry Wars: Galaxies offers three main modes namely Galaxy, Retro Evolved and Multiplayer. The first is undoubtedly the most substantial of the package, and is made up of a variety of planets (to all intents and purposes the various game levels) divided by galaxies, all of which can be progressively unlocked after the outlay of geom. These are collectibles that are released by destroyed enemies, and act as both a currency and a points multiplier (for a maximum of 150 units) within each single stage. Another peculiarity of the Galaxy mode is the constant presence, alongside the protagonist spacecraft, of a drone guided by the CPU which provides different support according to the selected behavior: initially only the attack pattern is available, but with geoms it is possible unlock others that must be progressively enhanced with experience points (given automatically following the use of a particular drone within a stage). The second mode, Retro Evolved, does not need much explanation, as it is nothing more than the conversion of the title available on Live Arcade, while a few unflattering words should be spent on multiplayer, so confusing as to be practically unplayable, and which moreover, it often causes slowdowns of a non-negligible entity. Graphically speaking, the game obviously retains the ~retro-chic~ look of the original, with elementary polygonal constructions accompanied however by astonishing particle effects, explosions of every shape and color and tasty distortions of the game grid. Too bad that, due to the lower resolution of the Wii compared to the Xbox 360, the final result is much more blurry, not to mention the slowdowns we mentioned earlier. Comment Geometry Wars: Galaxies is a title that appears a bit distorted on the Wii: the control system via nunchuck and remote makes you miss the conventional analog sticks, the graphics appear decidedly less defined than the original and the contents of the Galaxy mode don't seem to justify the price at which the product is offered. However, the Kuju work remains a unique example within the gaming landscape, a small gem that nostalgics, hardcore gamers or simply users looking for real challenges should take into serious consideration ... provided you also take into account the purchase of a Classic Controller. Pros It's Geometry Wars to the max Large amount of stages High level of challenge Cons Requires the Classic Controller to play properly Confusing, especially in multiplayer Full price not totally justified Hypotenuse galaxy Let's immediately clarify a fundamental concept, which, as we will see, will be decisive in the judgment of the title: Geometry Wars: Galaxies is not a video game that can be downloaded from the web for a handful of Euros, but a product sold on store shelves, for arrived at a price far from the budget definition. This should suggest that the developers of Kuju have worked hard in trying to offer players a playful experience so complete as to justify such a commercial placement: but, on balance, things are not quite like this. Anyway, let's go in order. Geometry Wars: Galaxies starts from the basic concepts of the highly successful Retro Evolved (which, we recall, was for a long time the most downloaded article in the Xbox 360 Live Arcade section), presenting itself as a radically old-school shooter inspired by the immortal Asteroids: the user therefore moves a ship within a limited space, shooting in all directions at the geometric shapes that soon end up crowding the screen. Where on Xbox the control system was limited to the two analog sticks - one delegated to move the spaceship and the other dedicated to the fire - on Wii we obviously tried to exploit the new magical pairingnchuck-remote, forcing the player to target enemies by rotating an on-screen laser sight via pad. A solution that simply doesn't work properly, and that forces anyone who wants to seriously engage in Geometry Wars: Galaxies to buy a Classic Controller: a further outlay of money that distances the Sierra product more and more from its original nature of ~low-cost hardcore shooter .", "date": "2007-12-28", "grade": null}
