Despite the inevitable decline that has smoothed out the versatility of the aforementioned products, catalysed by the global expansion of ~electronic games~, there are some historic board games that do not know any crisis, strong in a very long tradition that, even today, manages to cheer groups of friends and relatives, especially during holiday periods like the one just ended. Among them, the most famous and appreciated with copyright is undoubtedly Monopoly, or it would be better to write Monopoly, given that Hasbro, the American company that holds the international license, in 2009 also acquired the rights to the Italian version, changing its name which, over seventy years ago, Editrice Giochi was forced to use it due to the fascist regime, which forbade terms in English. Overall played by about eight hundred million people - based on a Guinness Book of Records statistic - and strong in a bizarre evolutionary history, even passing through the courts amid the theft of regulations and contaminations from other similar productions, Parker's famous negotiation game Brothers has not only resisted in its original 1935 form, but in recent years it has successfully landed in digital edition on numerous systems, finding new life thanks to the global diffusion of smartphones and tablets. In a somewhat surprising move, Ubisoft has decided to translate the Monopoly experience onto new generation consoles too, thanks to a package called Monopoly Family Fun Pack released in view of the recent Christmas holidays, strong in a budget price and some interesting introductions. We put the PlayStation 4 version through its paces and these are our impressions. Ubisoft brings a timeless classic to next generation consoles, Monopoly in the family! Mors tua vita mea For those unfamiliar with the rules of Monopoly, as specified in the introduction, it is a bargaining game, where the participants basically compete for lots of building land on a forty-square board, with the aim of causing the bankruptcy of the opponents to the sound of very high rents. Enriched by solutions such as mortgages, auctions and the possibility of proposing exchanges, as well as Contingency and Probability cards, linked, for example, to the payment of taxes or perhaps to the receipt of an inheritance from a deceased uncle, the game is strongly shaped around to capitalistic themes, and it is curious to think that it is still banned in Cuba today (who knows if the recent agreement with the United States does not also clear Monopoly), after decades of embargo also experienced in the former Soviet Union until its dissolution. In Monopoly Family Fun Pack, developed by Asobo, it is possible to play the original version of Monopoly (called Plus) both with the classic two-dimensional board and with a spectacular 3D animated variant, for up to six players locally or connected to the internet . The slots vacated by the missing players can be occupied by the CPU, whose artificial intelligence can be set to five different levels of difficulty, from very easy to difficult. In this regard, we have noticed a certain amount of ~extra luck~ for the dice rolls controlled by our PlayStation 4, at any level of difficulty, although with the lower levels there is a greater chance of winning during the negotiations. Of course, no one will give you the famous Parco della Vittoria and Viale dei Giardini for Vicolo Stretto and Vicolo Corto, respectively the most expensive and poorest pair of properties in Monopoly, but there is still much more room for manoeuvre, above all by putting offers and of the counter offers of money. Once you have selected your silver placeholder, from a lot of nine which also includes a Rabbid, in addition to the various historical Monopoly symbols such as the little dog, the racing car and the ship, you are projected onto the board in the classic Via box, surrounded by a living and pulsating city - in the case of the animated three-dimensional table - which in terms of design and graphic setting closely resembles that of the recent SimCity by Electronic Arts. After accessing the Hasbro Channel, it is also possible to download the setting dedicated to Ubisoft's pestiferous Rabbids for free, which add a touch of color and madness to the more adult, but still light-hearted aspect, of the traditional table. The game, in its original guise, works exactly like the one in the box, especially playing locally with friends (it is possible to switch hands with a single DualShock 4), nevertheless, the impossibility of skipping some animated sequences or at least shortening them, such as that of throwing the dice, further lengthens the longevity of the games, not exactly ~short~ as Monopoly experts well know. This is a problem that especially affects playing online, where the average time required for a single session is much higher than what is usually dedicated to other games. New ingredients Beyond the classic settings, in Monopoly Family Fun Pack the work of Parker Brothers can be played in different variants, more or less successful depending on the new rules introduced. The ~Quick Dice~ mode, for example, is one of the less appreciable ones, given that the additional red die does not break the traditional balance, but only adds confusion where it was not necessary. In ~Free Parking Money~, parking at the parking lot becomes a particularly useful box to visit, given that in this variant it is possible to withdraw all the money accumulated between fines and taxes to be paid; in ~Go! and Movement~, passing on the Go box it is possible to decide whether to collect money (400 credits) or move to another box on the board as desired, as well as avoiding an unfortunate Contingency card; in ~Double One~ a thousand credits are collected when two ones are obtained in a lucky roll of the dice; in ~Rent or Auctions~ the purchases of vacant properties can only be made through auctions, furthermore you cannot collect the rents while you are in prison; In ~Rule of Wealth~ the player who first collects three thousand capital credits wins the game, while in ~Property Improvements~ it is possible to build houses and hotels on the land without following the classic rules of color groups. In some cases these are interesting little introductions, but how many will actually be attracted to them? After all, Monopoly comes out above all in moments of family gathering, and it is difficult to imagine last-minute variations accepted by everyone on such a tested and loved game. To further shuffle the cards on the table, in the Monopoly Plus menu there is also room for the My Monopoly item, which allows you to customize and save nine distinct boards; not only is it possible to change the city center by positioning the various buildings available as desired (some are unlocked by playing the other modes or by switching to Uplay and Hasbro Channel), but you can also replace the images of the boxes with defined sets - actually not very rich - and rename individual lots. In the main menu of the game, in addition to the Monopoly Plus section, which contains all the features listed so far, there is also space for Monopoly Deal, a 2008 card game based on the elements of Monopoly, in which it is necessary to collect three complete groups of properties to win the game. In Monopoly Deal the Action cards make the difference, which allow, among other things, to steal or exchange property and money cards. It is a rather popular card game, which in Monopoly Family Fun Pack, beyond the exhaustive tutorial, can only be played online and against a maximum of five players. It is possible to participate in quick, customized matches or create a new one, and you can also view the updated rankings, where at the time of writing, a player with 350 wins literally dominates in first place. Loads of money From a purely technical point of view we are certainly not faced with a production capable of showing the claws of the Sony flagship, however it should be emphasized that Monopoly Fun Family Pack offers some interesting solutions. As mentioned, the design of the animated board is well packaged and closely resembles the graphic layout of the latest SimCity, furthermore the animations of the players' symbols, those of the launch of data and of the various properties for sale, where the works in course and the differences due to the level of luxury of the lots, are really nice and cared for. Too bad there is a little confusion with the colors, given the anthology of graphic inputs that continuously ~disturb~ the player's attention, making constant visits to the two-dimensional view necessary to have one's availability under control. The 1080p resolution overall gives a pleasant and unprecedented glimpse of the traditional Monopoly table, also embellished by the physics of the virtual dice when they impact on the players' symbols. From an audio point of view, Frunfortunately, the background music is yes nice but all too repetitive, while the speaker who comments on the various phases of the game is annoying to say the least.", "date": "2015-01-08", "grade": "7.0"}
