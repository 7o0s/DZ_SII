A long interval of time, which has seen the NeocoreGames franchise gain popularity among action RPG enthusiasts and develop with a trilogy that has recently been collected, with all the necessary improvements and balances, in the Final Cut edition. Console owners have therefore been waiting for a long time to be able to confront the adventure of the legendary monster hunter, son of the original Abraham Van Helsing, a character created by Bram Stoker for the novel ~Dracula~ but revisited for the occasion. Accompanied by the inseparable Lady Katarina, a ghostly lady who for some reason has remained tied to him, Van Helsing finds himself exploring the Borgovia region on the trail of a horde of dangerous werewolves, but what he finds waiting for him is something much worse. : a real alliance between creatures of the night, with an occult direction to move the strings. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is confirmed as an action RPG of substance, but with some shortcomings Hunting that passes you Free this month for Xbox LIVE Gold account holders, on sale for 14.99 for everyone else, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing certainly benefited greatly from the genre's renewed popularity in its early days, but also by the charm of a setting that fishes in the collective imagination among werewolves, forest monsters, vampires, ghosts and more. The relationship between the protagonist and his partner is rendered very well thanks to dialogues full of humor and quotations, well interpreted in English and subtitled in Italian, and this partly fills the lack of a solid plot accompanying the product. The rest of the experience is divided between exploration, fights and loot, with a large amount of objects and treasures to find, a crafting system that is not exactly immediate but interesting, as well as a skill tree that allows you to develop your own relatively quickly character, so as to make him lethal from a distance or in close combat, more or less shrewd or resistant, but above all equipped with a repertoire of moves capable of always offering him an extra cue to get the better of enemies who often and willingly attack in packs. The combat system is based on the support role of Katarina, who transforms into a ghost with long claws and strikes the enemies keeping them away from us (however without major risks: once defeated, she simply needs some time to get back on her feet ), so as to allow us to hit them with firearms or to get close to deliver some powerful blows. The big problem lies in the rendering of the impacts, practically absent, which inevitably ends up taking away the charm and fun of the clashes, even the most demanding ones. Furthermore, some not too well-chosen balancing choices lead in the early stages to face very resistant monsters, forcing continuous ~hit and run~ in order not to succumb to their blows. From this point of view, the changes made to the gameplay by the developers in the Final Cut are greatly missed. Xbox One goals The twenty-six unlockable Achievements in The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing are mostly based on numbers, rewarding us when we kill a certain amount of enemies, visit all locations and complete quests. The richest Objectives obviously provide for the completion of the game at the highest difficulty levels, the correct resolution of all the spirits' puzzles and the collection of rare objects. To the adventure We explore and fight in The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, and one of the most successful aspects of the game is precisely the amount of quests available, between main and secondary missions, which always keep us busy and take us into settings full of mysteries and with a design that is anything but trivial, which is no small thing these days. Collecting new weapons or enhancing those in our possession, through the acquisition of experience and money, translates into substantial differences during battles; differences that with the Hunter class, available by default (while the Thaumaturge and Arcanum Mechanic classes must be purchased separately for 3.99 euros each) it is possible to enhance by alternating firearms and hand weapons, by selecting the style in real time . The single player campaign guarantees about ten hours of gameplay, but there are also secondary modes to offer something more: Scenario, i.e. single missions within the same settings as in the story, but with specific objectives to be achieved; Storia Infinita, which stands as a sort of New Game+, with high-level enemies to fight; and the multiplayer component, which allows you to tackle the adventure in an online cooperative, but which we found problematic in several respects, both in terms of matchmaking and in the presence of more or less annoying glitches. We are sure that an update will fix the issue but, for the moment, this component of the NeocoreGames title remains in the shade. As far as the technical implementation is concerned, the conversion appears very well done (although you have to get used to a not exactly intuitive layout of the controls), with defined textures and a frame rate that remains constant except when the enemies on the screen they actually become many, which leads to clearly perceiving declines. We are not talking about spectacular graphics, especially for the animations, but the variety of creatures and opponents, as well as the aforementioned scenario design, are to be appreciated.", "date": "2015-12-08", "grade": "7.0"}
