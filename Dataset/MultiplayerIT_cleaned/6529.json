Born as an episodic indie project for Xbox 360, it stops after the publication of the second chapter, probably due to poor sales, proving once again that point and click adventures are not a genre too loved by the console public, not even horror ones. Years go by and it is easy that even the few who had loved the Shining Gate Software title on the Microsoft console have forgotten it, despairing of being able to play with the conclusion of the story. Lots of sympathy But this is not the case, because the project has been taken over by Daedelic Entertainment, developer and publisher specializing in the genre, then recently relaunched for PC in a finally complete form, i.e. including the two chapters already published and the remaining third, which has remained unpublished so far . So, those curious to know the conclusion of the story of Sam and his terrible nightmares are satisfied. The boy, a drug addict hoping to get back to life, is in the ~Reaching Dreams~ recovery center, a nursing home that uses highly advanced techniques to fight addictions and mental illnesses of its clients. Unfortunately, things don't go well and Sam finds himself the victim of horrible visions, forced to visit places in the grip of evil where he has to reconstruct what is happening. I'm scared! Decay - The Mare's interface can be described as basic, not to mention crude. The environment is explored for fixed screens, clicking on interactive objects to examine them and using those collected in the inventory when necessary. Every now and then you can read some document, which breaks the rhythm of the puzzles a bit, while in one of the chapters you collect a camera that you can use to discover hidden elements, and in another a clock that allows you to manipulate time. In general, the player is only required to understand how to use the objects found. Despite the horror atmosphere and some sudden frights caused by unexpected appearances, you can't die. Some might see it as a contradiction for a title that focuses entirely on the horror atmosphere. In reality, the formula works in its own way and, although there are no risks, a minimum of tension is always felt, with the possibility of something unexpected happening perpetually hanging in the air. Don't be fooled: the game consists of still screens The scenario helps in the involvement, which in its minimalism gives a good idea of a traumatic experience to be reconstructed going forward in the game, helped by the few but well-studied documents (newspaper clippings, post-its and so on), which they each give an extra piece of the plot without ever revealing too much, but without leaving the adventurer dry-mouthed. It's easy to say that history is the strong point of Decay - The Mare, the pivot around which the whole production revolves. Consider that it doesn't last very long and that the three chapters can be concluded in less than three hours, with a few more minutes to spend in case you want to find all the hidden coins (the only real extra content present). Unfortunately the puzzles, however spot on, are also very simple. In short, seasoned adventurers will never have problems moving forward; but budding adventurers might be enticed to buy just by the accessibility of the puzzles. Among those that we can consider defects, apart from those related to production values, we must include the bad management of shots in the transitions between areas. Sometimes you pass a door to find it in front of you instead of behind you, while on other occasions there are no reference points to understand the extent of the movement made with the click. Of course, this is an annoying but not a tragic problem, given that the map to explore is not very large and that, therefore, once you have memorized the position of all the rooms, you no longer lose your bearings and move with great fluidity.
