Yes, because playing Size Matters immediately brings with it all the feeling of the Ps2 chapters, from every point of view. Starting from the game structure, faithfully anchored to the standards offered by the series so far. So here everything revolves around the crossing of decidedly large levels with linear progression, eliminating any enemy who dares to stand in front of our hero, and destroying crates and collecting bolts to use as currency in the shops. Obviously there is one of the components that have contributed most to the success of the franchise, namely the large number of weapons and gadgets to be used during the game, essential to give a particular variety to the whole and to allow you to tackle the levels in a personal and not rigid way pre-established. As far as weapons are concerned, each of them has a bar that increases with its use, only to then allow for an upgrade once it is completely filled. To break up the possible repetitiveness of the action, several scattered mini-games have been inserted, in reality not always of such a quality as to make their inclusion welcome. Moving on to the plot, it is not exactly the most elaborate or original seen in recent years, to put it mildly, but it is clear that this only constitutes a glue between the various planets to be crossed. Also in this episode, in fact, the levels are represented by different planets, an expedient that made it possible to ~mask~ the only noteworthy loads present in the game, which take place in the journey via spaceship from one to the other. In fact, Size Matters uses the never-praised streaming technology enough, with continuous access to the disc that allows you to enjoy the gameplay without interruption. It is therefore clear that one of the most recurring criticisms of the PSP software, i.e. the exhausting length of the uploads, has no reason to exist on this occasion. The second point of discussion has instead often revolved around the control system, given the well-known absence of the second analog stick and two back buttons compared to Ps2. The programmers have adopted a convincing solution, allowing Ratchet to move freely with the stick, delegating the lateral strafe to the directional cross; L and R have instead been assigned to the rotation of the camera, and some small modifications have been made necessary for the use of certain objects or skills. The result is slightly cumbersome but more than satisfactory, and we sincerely doubt that it would have been possible to do better in this sense; however, it is possible to reset the commands if the default scheme is not to one's liking. A handsome hairy boy From a technical point of view, the work done by the High Impact Games guys is nothing short of excellent; the Sony laptop seems to be an inexhaustible source of surprises, and probably with the awaited God of War we will be forced to be amazed again. Size Matters accompanies a polygonal complexity very close to that of the episodes on Ps2 with a fluidity that is almost never in question; and even the textures, often a weak point of the PSP, leave no room for significant criticism in this case. The settings are accurate and full of details, characters and enemies alike appear very characterized and well animated, and the CG sequences integrate perfectly. Obviously, the audio component also maintains the trademark of the series, a guarantee of quality both for the sound accompaniment and for the dubbing, essential to guarantee the humor that Ratchet and Clank fans know well. On the other hand, the multiplayer component is decidedly weak, not very interesting despite offering both online and ad hoc support; a pity, because it could have increased the longevity of the main mode, which can be completed in (much) less than 10 hours. Comment Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters is exactly what Daxter was, that is an exclusive episode for PSP of the original Ps2 series capable of performing its task perfectly, without however wanting to dare or risk anything. So don't expect surprises or news from Size Matters; on the other hand, if you loved the previous chapters on Ps2, Sony production will undoubtedly be able to offer you an experience completely faithful to the one lived in the living room at home, from practically every point of view. Which, considering the excellent quality of the franchise, is no small thing. Pros A very good episode of the serie Graphically splendid Nothing to envy to Ps2 Cons No major news Mini-games of fluctuating quality Negligible multiplayer The titles of the series made in Sony Ratchet and Clank can undoubtedly be ascribed among the best three-dimensional action/platformers of the last generation of consoles; in addition to critical acclaim, Insomniac Games' effort has also been able to count on an excellent commercial response since its debut, which has allowed it to sell over 25 million copies overall around the world. While waiting for the great and promising debut on Ps3 with Tools of Destruction, fans of the franchise can ~console themselves~ with this exclusive chapter for PSP, subtitled Size Matters, in Italy ~Height does not matter~.", "date": "2007-06-15", "grade": null}
