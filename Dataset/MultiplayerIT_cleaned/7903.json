{"name": "Tekken col morto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/117202-tekken-card-tournament-tekken-col-morto.html", "text": "Despite being one of the few fighting titles that has attempted in some way to offer a plot to justify the various fisticuffs, there have been few alternative variations to that of the classic fight dedicated to the Tekken universe. Apart from the questionable cinematographic transpositions (two animated and one with flesh and blood actors, to put it mildly), the official ~spin offs~ involved one of the cutest and most charismatic protagonists, Nina Williams, to whom the adventure was dedicated action ~Death by Degrees~, and some appearances by Law and Paul in a 3D scrolling fighting game by Namco, Urban Reign. However, starting from the third episode of the Iron Fist saga, numerous mini games were introduced, as simple pastimes but also, in some cases, as the only way to unlock characters or bonuses that would otherwise be impossible to find. The most famous was perhaps the Tekken Bowl, a nice bowling game presented for the first time in Tekken Tag Tournament and already proposed for some time for free on iOS platforms. However, Tekken Card Tournament brings one of the most traditional fighting games closer to the fascinating world of card games, the realm of strategy and the most extreme tactical mechanisms, for the first time, creating a potentially very interesting mix. Rock, scissors or fists? Tekken Card Tournament is therefore a title that, apart from the name, has nothing in common with the classic fighting game, which is why even those who have never delivered an uppercut or a virtual kick in their life, but are instead passionate about card games, can safely give it a try. The Free-to-play formula, which we will discuss shortly, allows free installation and the start of fights in a simple and fast way, thanks to a complete and clear tutorial in Italian. All you need is a Facebook account and even the tedious initial registration can easily be skipped. Once you have chosen your favorite character, among a very small group made up of Marshall Law, Yoshimitsu, Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, Kazuya Mishima, Ling Xiayou, Lili and Panda, you are immediately given a deck of basic cards, essential for starting the first fights. The cards actually contain, at least initially, nothing but the moves of your character, called as in the official Command List of the game. Each card corresponds to a move, clearly indicated, and a value in life points. The more advanced cards, which can be purchased with accumulated play money, real money, gifted or won, in addition to the name of the heist and its damage, include properties that activate when certain conditions are met (for example, if played first, they give life points or offer a shield for a turn, according to the classic schemes of card games based on clashes and vital points). The real fights, however, have the characteristic of being fast and frenetic, because the goal is in fact to simulate a real Tekken clash using the cards instead of the action keys on the pad. After the start, therefore, the two players have 10 seconds to choose the action of their character at the same time, among the three available: Focus, Strike and Block. Focus, literally ~concentration~, is an indispensable action because when carried out it allows you to draw a card from your deck; at that moment, however, the character remains vulnerable to a possible ~Strike~ from the opponent. The Strike is therefore the real attack, which can only be selected if you have at least one card. The Block is instead the normal parry; however, the functioning is different from the Tekken tradition, because in the case of Block, in defense of a Strike, the parry will work against only the first two cards of the opponent. Considering that up to 5 cards can coexist on the virtual game table (that is, it is possible to choose Focus up to 5 times in a row if not interrupted), in the event of an attack with all possible cards, the theoretical exposure of the last three hits remains. Ultimately, given the speed of choice, the fight in Tekken Card Tournament resembles a revised and corrected version of the old rock, scissors and paper; however, the absolute balance of the aforementioned game does not apply in this case, because for example the Focus action remains useful both against another Focus and against a Block, while the parry becomes a wasted blow against a Focus, it does not give advantages against a another parry and above all it is partially effective against attacks formed by three cards up. In essence, to win you need luck and a spirit of observation towards your opponent, because to be honest there doesn't seem to be much ~pure~ tactics. Real money purchases, back to the much utilified formula of Free-to-play, for the first levels of experience they are not absolutely necessary. Certainly the temptation to give more value to your deck, by buying the packets in the shop and hoping for some high-level moves, can present itself, but it is an absolutely avoidable action if you don't want to immediately aim for great goals. On the other hand, it is mandatory to spend credits every 5 games played, to ~recharge~ the character from the efforts incurred, but also in this case the gifts of victories and various bonuses prevented him from putting his hand to his wallet. Then there is a menu for managing your deck and ~mergers~, i.e. the upgrades of the cards which, by combining several equal moves, create a more effective one. The game modes are offline combat, initially locked on the ~easy~ difficulty until you reach experience level 10, friendlies and the online championship. Of note is the rapid matchmaking, perfect and free of delays in every situation; the absence of lag is obviously due to the fact that the fights do not take place in real time but all the moves are performed in a pre-rendered way by the various characters. The text interface is very clear, the fight videos are pleasant but totally devoid of the details viewable on consoles (which also applies to the PC version). Finally, the music in the menus is annoying, fortunately it can be deactivated.", "date": "2013-04-12", "grade": "6.5"}
