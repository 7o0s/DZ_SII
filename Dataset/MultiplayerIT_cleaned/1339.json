{"name": "Conan", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conan.html", "text": "Vendetta! At the sight of the destroyed village, of women and children burned alive in their homes, the player also feels a great desire to sharpen Conan's sword on the bicuspid teeth of the escaped knights. Before revenge takes place, however, you need to get familiar with the game's control system and face some ferocious wolves to get some practice. Through the Dual Shock 2, it is possible to perform two types of slashing (high and low), jump and parry. The jump key is also used to interact with some elements of the landscape. The left analog stick is responsible for controlling the character, the right one for managing the view (awkward in the impossibility of being adjusted vertically). Finally, the back buttons activate the map or are used together with the attack ones to obtain particular sequences of shots. The fights are fundamentally based on timing: you have to block the attack of the enemy on duty and press keys in succession to perform moves with variable effectiveness: there are so many available. Every time you kill an opponent, you gain experience points that you can spend to upgrade attacks (like Super Robot Wars, go). Furthermore, along the levels, new weapons can be collected, generally more effective than the starting sword but with which it is impossible to perform combos. Speaking of combos, it must be said that the control system is rather difficult to tame: this translates into the impossibility of producing the moves in most cases, with the serious consequence of forcing the player to do without them. Game structure and technical implementation The levels are generally short, characterized by the presence of some simple puzzles (~which way do I go?~) and some enemies to slice. Fights often take place outnumbered, so it is important to decide when to strike and when to parry, also and above all because collisions are not always detected correctly. When you are overwhelmed by the enemy, you find yourself (after the ~Stargate~ sequence) in the misty realm of Crom, the earth deity worshiped by Conan. Here the player is given a second chance: if he manages to defeat opponents, he will be able to return to the fight that saw him fall. Otherwise nisba. Interestingly, this only happens when you are defeated, not when, for example, you accidentally fall off a cliff. From a technical point of view, Conan shows many good things. Some of the music is taken from the exceptional soundtrack of the films, the sound effects are quite ~powerful~ and the Italian version is characterized by a good quality dubbing, afflicted by a serious defect: there is only one voice actor for narrator, character and enemies. As far as graphics are concerned, there is an excellent light management system (similar to the one seen in Gladiator - Sword of Vengeance, but not of the same quality) which does not fail to be enhanced in the presence of environments with different shades. Conan is well drawn, owes much to Schwarzenegger's plastic poses and gives a pretty good idea of his massive build. Enemies are also well done, while the levels come with ups and downs, especially in the textures. So, Conan is a valid title from an aesthetic point of view. If he enjoyed the Devil May Cry feeling in the fights, it would have been a masterpiece. Unfortunately, however, this is not the case and there is another (sad) similarity with the aforementioned Gladiator - Sword of Vengeance in the bad management of the fights. Impacts are not rendered well, moves are difficult to execute, collisions are not well detected. It is even possible to defeat even the strongest opponents simply by continuing to press the same key. In short, we proceed for the quality of the story and for the atmosphere, but certainly not because the game is really fun. With this in mind, the addition of the ~arena~ mode ends up having no value, relying completely on what is the weakest point of this product. Comment A wasted opportunity. Conan is beautiful to look at and has a compelling story, but it deserved a better treatment when it comes to programming pure and simple. Instead it ends up reiterating once again the inability of many western teams to produce good fight routines, adding to an unfortunately too long list of examples Pros: Great soundtrack Engaging and atmospheric story Well done graphics Cons: Fightingcompletely to be reviewed Graphic engine sometimes uneven Short levels We find ourselves once again talking about the rediscovery of the fantasy genre, which took place basically thanks to the film adaptation of Tolkien's ~The Lord of the Rings~. In this case Conan is the character who returns to the limelight, after experiencing a golden age on all fronts in the 80s. The video game developed by the Cauldron team has the great merit of referring to the cinematic Conan for how good the two films have been able to show on a visual level, and of having an engaging plot, punctuated by a multitude of evocative narrated sequences. Conan, from adventure to adventure, returns to his native village to see the few relatives still alive. Before arriving, he is nearly run over by a group of mysterious knights running in the opposite direction - a very bad sign. In fact, the warrior finds the village destroyed: dead on the streets, burnt houses and the last words of an old man, crucified for having resisted more than the others. Revenge is one of the fundamental values for the Cimmerian, who vows to slaughter the perpetrators of the havoc as soon as he finds them and launches into a relentless pursuit, which will lead him to face once again evil and supernatural forces.", "date": "2004-04-06", "grade": null}
