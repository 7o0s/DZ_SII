We are talking about a race well known for its extreme danger, and which probably precisely because of its disturbing statistics attracts enthusiastic spectators and drivers from all over the world. In the game as in reality, just get distracted for a moment to finish at full speed against an obstacle, taking a curve that is too wide and losing grip due to a sidewalk, arriving long and squashing yourself against the barriers that delimit the route. However, the terrible English track is not the only one available in the game, which actually practically doubles the offer compared to the previous edition with a total of eighteen fascinating and suggestive routes, combining the main modes with an interesting sandbox based on a set of challenges from 'ability. Gameplay One of the strengths of TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2 is undoubtedly the excellent rendering of speed, further emphasized by the sound of the wind breaking on the rider's helmet, more or less noticeable depending on the view used among the five available. It is an aspect that the developers had well implemented in the first episode and which is further enhanced in this sequel, which therefore offers truly adrenaline-pumping races, trying to give us a precise idea of what it means to whiz at full speed at aboard a sport bike. However, we are not talking about an arcade experience, on the contrary: as mentioned at the beginning, a small distraction is enough to crash and in this case there is no rewind function: we will have to live with our mistakes, even if perhaps a crash will lead us to curse from frustration and facing even more nervously for the rest of the race, with potentially disastrous results. The driving model therefore tends towards realism already starting from the intermediate level, implying careful management of the accelerator and the position of the driver in order to avoid dangerous wheelies when recovering or the risk of slipping at the first corner. On PlayStation 4 you have to deal with the usual dead zone of the analog stick, which makes it really difficult to brush the curves and rather pushes you to use continuous corrections of the trajectory. In any case, the many options present allow you to adjust the various aspects of the gameplay so that they lend themselves to our needs, starting naturally from the automatic or manual gearbox and passing through traction control, display of the ideal trajectory, ABS, the braking system and other aids. Pieces of a puzzle able to guarantee us an unexpectedly solid system, made deeper by a really well-paced progression during the single player career: every little upgrade is paid for and helps to improve competitiveness, allowing us to aim higher in the next race. It seems little, but it is a really important addition for the purposes of engagement. Playstation 4 trophies The 52 Trophies obtainable in TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2 revolve around many aspects of the experience, rewarding the first time we perform certain actions, cross the finish line, carry out upgrades, complete seasons and obtain new motorcycles. Structure and technical realization As for the modes of TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2, from the start screen it is possible to access the aforementioned career, the inevitable fulcrum of the experience, in which we will have to start from the bottom and earn increasingly important contracts by looking for to achieve team goals. Outside of the busy calendar of events, divided by degree of difficulty and therefore more or less rich in terms of rewards, there is also a pleasant sandbox in which we will be able to participate in various skill challenges to obtain components or extra money. then made up of quick races, timed runs, exercises and a competitive online multiplayer for eight participants: more abundant content than in the first episode, although at first glance you don't pay much attention to it. The number of bikes available is also increasing, while remaining distant from the numbers of the most famous racers: a factor that must also be considered in view of the sale price, perhaps a little too high. The technical realization of the game rests on fairly solid foundations: the tricks we have already mentioned, first and foremost the excellent speed performance, and an audio design capable of enhancing everything by increasing involvement during racing. But it is aboveThe whole scenario to enhance, thanks to decidedly suggestive panoramas: the climatic conditions and the time are not dynamic, it is true, but the races set at sunset in combination with the glimpses of some locations will certainly capture your attention, leaving you sometimes with my mouth open. On PS4 Pro the graphics engine holds up well and the uncertainties are few, just some pop-up effects from time to time, but there isn't an option to go beyond 30 fps and the thing is immediately reveals a problem: the fluidity is insufficient for a racer of this type, which requires promptness and precision. Too bad this time too for the animations and physics of the falls, a bit thrown away.", "date": "2020-03-18", "grade": "7.0"}
