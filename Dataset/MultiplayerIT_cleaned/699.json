{"name": "Ratchet: Gladiator", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ratchet-gladiator.html", "text": "Killing enemies earns you money, which you can then spend through the special ~sales points~ located in the locations and which allow you to buy weapons and ammunition. You will have to face a really large number of enemies ...using a large number of devastating weapons. In some cases your Bots will be essential. The game Almost immediately, Ratchet is accompanied on his outings by a pair of sentient robots, who have the task of covering his back with the weapons supplied and can be used to activate switches of various types. When the robots are destroyed, it is possible to bring them back to life by simply pressing a button, which proves to be a sensible choice already at an average difficulty level: the developers have inserted four degrees of challenge, therefore you will have to resort to all your resources to complete the game in the most challenging way. Well, the speech of ~complete~, then, is very relative: Ratchet: Gladiator is very long, it is extremely full of situations, challenges and events, as well as modalities: in fact, the classic single game is flanked by two multiplayer options of great interest, offline and online. The first allows you to face the story mode in two, cooperating as now happens in very few video games; the second paves the way for the usual number of online challenges with other players. Killing enemies earns you money, which you can then spend through the special ~sales points~ located in the locations and which allow you to buy weapons and ammunition. Ammunition that you can also find scattered throughout the stages, along with supplies for your energy. In any case, the number of usable weapons is truly vast, exceeding ten units and offering an intelligent upgrade system, which improves the effectiveness of each tool depending on the use made of it. In addition to this ~natural~ enhancement, you can purchase modifications to assign to weapons, of two types: Alpha and Omega. The former are simply obtained with an effective use of weapons and with the passing of the stages, the latter are purchased and must be mounted in order to endow your offensives with even paradoxical implications (as in the case of the modification that transforms the affected enemies into explosive animals ). Once you have a good number of weapons, you will be able to handle practically any situation in the most spectacular way: get rid of the light enemies with Ratchet's ~wrench~, to then equip the very powerful Arbiter and blow up the ships that arrive on the spot to unload enemies, finally giving a final cleaning with a sort of ~nuclear mace~ (cultured quote). What amazes are not the numbers of the game, although frightening, but the naturalness with which all the elements blend in favor of a great playability. One of the many variations on the theme, in this case on board an ~off-road vehicle~. The effects of your most powerful weapons are not affected. powerful are undoubtedly spectacular. Your trusty wrench will allow you to use it. to be right of the opponents more; light. The increase in production costs for current video games has had the merit of raising their average quality: software houses spend much more time in the design phase and this can then be seen on the screen. Insomniac confirms the trend, given that to make Ratchet: Gladiator he must have spent a lot of time planning and evaluating ideas, obtaining a convincing result from every point of view. Live from Dreadzone The game is peppered with entertaining animated sequences, which from time to time show the development of the story. We will therefore witness the ridiculous advances of the Dreadzone conductor to his robotic colleague, the commercials of the big boss Gleeman Vox (who desperately tries to sell the gadgets of the hated Dreadzone ~slaughter~) and the various attempts to pass Ratchet and Clank for gods rascals as their popularity grows. All these interludes are enhanced by an excellent dubbing in Italian (the voices of Pietro Ubaldi and Marco Balzarotti, among others, are clearly recognizable), a clear sign of how much the local distributor focuses (and rightly so) on this product. In the end, the plot is simple and linear, but it is told with a decidedly successful humor, so much so that it is not clear which target the developers wanted to address. The excellent playability of Ratchet: Gladiator is also and above all expressed in the variety of situations proposed. If the clashes in the Dreadzone arena are basically fights for their own sake, albeit with some rules to respect, the campaigns on the various planets see the protagonist explore thearea and use vehicles of different nature according to your needs: a fast ~off-road vehicle~, a spaceship, an interstellar fighter and a devastating, devastating (but really devastating) Landstalker, a mechanical monster with unprecedented firepower. Completing the stages aboard this latest instrument of destruction is always a pleasure and gives rise to memorable sequences... The exceptional playability of Ratchet: Gladiator is also and above all expressed in the variety of situations proposed. One of the most important phases spectacular, aboard an interstellar fighter. Ships carrying enemies must be destroyed very quickly, with heavy artillery. Some enemies are not only huge, but also deadly and resistant to blows. Technical realization Sequences that make extensive use of polygons and special effects, but that don't put a bomb-proof graphics engine in difficulty. And here the technical aspect of the product comes into play: Ratchet: Gladiator is not only fun and engaging, it is not only varied and ~substantial~ due to the number of stages, challenges and modes. It is also beautiful to look at and to hear. Insomniac has done a slap-up job: the polygonal models of the characters are impeccable in any case, whether it's the protagonists or the least important of the enemies. Numerous enemies by type and quantity, which must be faced differently when you have heavy weapons running out of ammunition. And what about the locations? Each planet differs from the others in the shades used, always showing a good level of detail, an excellent general design and practically no defects in the construction of the structures. And to think that everything is moved even at great speeds when you have to face challenges aboard spacecraft or off-road vehicles ... The sound sector succeeds in the task of not disfiguring in front of the graphic one, thanks to the dubbing in Italian (which has already been done mention), catchy music (of an electronic genre: in fact, anything else would have been ~out of tune~) and a series of really convincing sound effects. Comment With Ratchet: Gladiator, Insomniac has managed to package a product of excellent quality, which also makes use of new modes (cooperative multiplayer is something that is not found everywhere, on the contrary) and which bases its appeal on solid gameplay such as rock, extremely varied and engaging. If you own a PS2 and can only buy one game for Christmas, here's a purchase you certainly won't regret. Pros: Technically top for PS2 Extremely playable and durable Great dubbing in Italian Cons: Intermediate difficulty level is perhaps a bit simple. If you don't like the series you won't change your mind with Gladiator. Running Man Ratchet and Clank, brave space travelers, are commissioned to investigate the trafficking of an interplanetary network that owns a monopoly on television broadcasting thanks to Dreadzone, a reality show whose protagonists are modern gladiators, committed to surviving within apocalyptic scenarios and hostile. Dreadzone ~competitors~ do not volunteer, but are imprisoned and forced to fight using a collar that can explode on command. And this is exactly what also happens to Ratchet, Clank and Al: the three are imprisoned, then the first is equipped with battle armor and launched into the fray of the arenas. The location from which we start is an orbital station that enjoys direct access to the Dreadzone arena and from which it is possible to leave to reach the planets that serve as the scenario for the transmission. There are around fifteen planets in all to explore, each with varying numbers of stages to tackle and extra challenges. The Dreadzone arena itself is revisited often, providing new stages and new challenges as you go along. Basically, you have to complete the ~mandatory~ levels of each location to access the next one, but in some cases you have to go through the challenges as well. And it's a pleasant obligation, given that in Ratchet: Gladiator you don't frantically look for the end of the game, rather any pretext is good to resume the Dual Shock...", "date": "2005-12-14", "grade": null}
