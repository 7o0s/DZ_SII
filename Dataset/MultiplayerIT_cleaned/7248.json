The spin-off operation is usually characterized by a double value: because behind the genuine desire to give space to different ideas and creatively explore new expressive possibilities within a well-known and established reference world, one can hide the attempt to revive a trend that may have run out of ideas and the ability to interest and convince. The premises of Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z were excellent, with the promising idea of proposing an opposite point of view to the classic one by putting ourselves in the shoes of Yaiba, one of Ryu's rivals, and the interesting collaboration set up between Team Ninja, Comcept and Spark Unlimited putting none other than Keiji Inafune (creator of Mega Man, for one) at the head of the project. Even the irreverent style adopted, between cel shading graphics, B-series horror influences with the classic zombie apocalypse and trashy tones which in fact represent a real affront to the traditions of the series, seemed to demonstrate a remarkable self-confidence on the part of the developers. Or a disaster waiting to happen. The result is a bit in between, which does not reach the heights of the classic chapters of the series, also due to the same desire of the developers to keep away from the previous standards of Team Ninja, but which still manages to entertain, albeit with rather derivative solutions in terms of gameplay. Despite the genes at work and the unconventional premises, in fact, Yaiba rather faithfully follows the scheme of the third-person action game in the style of God of War or Devil May Cry, undoubtedly illustrious models to follow, but from Inafune and Ninja Gaiden it would be reasonable to expect something more than an academic re-proposition of well-tested structures. What can come of the cybernetic resurrection of a foul-mouthed ninja assassin? Find out in Yaiba The halved ninja Yaiba Kamikaze is the protagonist of the story, and to call him an anti-hero would be an understatement. In fact, Yaiba is a real unscrupulous criminal, who did not hesitate to exterminate his own clan to achieve notoriety and the upright Ryu Hayabusa found himself on his way, who killed him in a fight to the death . As in a sort of ninja matrix RoboCop, Yaiba is then recovered by the mysterious Forge Industries and partially rebuilt with cybernetic elements, effectively bringing him back to life. The protagonist, equipped with a mechanical eye and arm, is literally held together by anger and a desire for revenge, but does not disdain a decidedly sarcastic approach to events, between constant jokes, colorful language and rather malevolent considerations about everything around him. However, due to his artificial components that keep him alive in a controlled manner, Yaiba is forced to follow the instructions of the company that brought him back from the dead and has to carry out various missions which usually include eliminating other ninja. At the beginning of the game, Yaiba is thrown into an undead hell with the aim of clearing the areas and discovering what lies behind the strange events causing the contagion. However, there is also time for revenge, because apparently Ryu Hayabusa is no stranger to the events and Yaiba's ~investigation~ essentially turns into a chase for the implacable ninja of the Hayabusa clan. The story is not exactly a cornerstone of the gaming experience but the particular characterization imparted by the developers helps to give a particular identity to Yaiba, with enjoyable dialogues for those who appreciate foul-mouthed and over-the-top trash and some skits that will not fail to snatch a few sneers, in the typically Japanese demented humor pushed to the limit of bad taste in numerous situations. Let's make things clear right away though: this is a game that needs to be tackled with an ironic approach because for fans of the playful features and classic atmospheres of Ninja Gaiden it could represent a real affront, if seen as a full-fledged sequel to the adventures of Ryu Hayabusa, which Yaiba absolutely does not want to be. Academy action As we said, the atypical and innovative premises of this spin-off break on a rather academic basic structure, which follows the playful solutions seen in other great third-person action games. If the combat system is significantly different from the typical Ninja Gaiden, there isto say that it is very close to the one seen in God of War and Devil May Cry. From the alternation between defense and attack and from the technical dosage of the times, cardinal points (at least in situations of greater difficulty) of the Team Ninja series, Yaiba moves to a much more carefree approach to mass combat, approaching the definition of button masher even if a logic in the clashes is still necessary to be able to progress in the game. The characteristics of the three weapons and their mapping on the controller are not new elements in the genre: the protagonist is equipped with a mechanical fist for powerful and slow attacks in close combat, a katana for quick blows with the blade and a whip with interchangeable stats for ranged attacks. The numerous and spectacular combos that enliven the fights are born from the alternation of these weapons, while the characteristics of the different enemies impose in some cases the choice of specific weapons, thus forcing not to abuse a single type of attack. It must be said that in the heat of the clashes, however, chaos prevails, which further distances Ninja Gaiden Z from its predecessors, with the greater strategic shrewdness dedicated above all to the frequent use of the shot to dodge attacks and get out of situations more intricate (largely preferable to the standard parry in most cases) and the use of ~fatalities~ which can be triggered at the end of some combos and which, beyond the excellent scenographic effect, allow you to partially restore the energy of Yaiba. By stringing together combos and eliminating enemies, a special bar also grows which, once full, allows you to release the ~bloodlust~, a brief state of berserk which allows you to resolve the most difficult situations in a few seconds, but which must be managed with a certain parsimony for the amount of time required to be able to recharge its energy. The progression scheme of the game essentially provides for a continuous increase in the amount of enemies to be killed all together, throwing an industrial quantity into the fray, as you progress through the levels, drawing from increasingly complex types. In this scan of the path in progressive clashes, the moments of variation with respect to the standard situations are only in correspondence with the ~platform~ sections, which we will discuss later, and with the boss fights, some of which are decidedly challenging, also due to of rather malevolently arranged checkpoints. A ninja with numbers The exploration of the levels does not allow great digressions, as these are set along rather narrow predefined paths, but there is still no shortage of secrets to unlock and objects to find, including story fragments, power-ups and assorted extras that also guarantee a minimum of replayability for the collection complete. Beyond the simple movement on the run, the game often confronts us with ~platform~ sections, even if the definition can be misleading. In practice, one finds himself having to perform quick time events following the pre-set path, with the only foresight to press the right button at the right time, another rather trite and never particularly appreciated solution, but still well inserted within the general dynamics . A few strokes of level design appear in the solution of rather basic puzzles, which usually include the activation of switches or the destruction of some parts of the scenario (the interactive elements are highlighted using the cybernetic view of the protagonist), often requiring the cynical exploitation of unaware zombies to be thrown around with a whip and to be slaughtered in the cruellest and most hilarious ways. In more complex situations, the cross-effects of the different elements on which the types of enemies and their respective attacks are based (fire, electricity and ~vomit~, just to give you an idea) also come into play, requiring you to resolve situations using weapons snatched from zombies, and zombies themselves, creatively. Another vaguely strategic element in the structure of the game is linked to the evolution of Yaiba, which takes place in progressive levels. Passing from one level to another, points are earned which can be spent on unlocking new skills and upgrades within a tree system that leaves the player free to select which characteristics to invest more in among the three different types of attack , even if getting to the end of the game it is not difficult to unlock practically all the possible perks. Some hidden objects in the levels allow you to increase the protagonist's energy and his resistance to attacks, which determines a certain degree of exploration.useful and justifies the fact of being able to go back to replaying the various missions even after having concluded them, in addition to the desire to increase the score collected. There are about 7 missions, each divided into various sub-sections and with a variable duration, which changes a lot based on the player's performance and the amount of attempts required to complete the levels. Tecmo Koei has let us know that the final version of Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z will also contain an Arcade mode not present in the review code used for the review. Xbox 360 goals 49 unlockable objectives for the classic total of 1000 points are the loot offered by Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z. The achievements are located both in conjunction with the progression between levels and upon reaching particular moments in the plot, and in correspondence with certain quantitative and qualitative performance to be achieved in the game. In general, the distribution of objectives is somewhat balanced and even a standard first pass within the levels guarantees an excellent collection of points, although a lot of training is required for the more selective achievements. Violence and cartoons The choice of the cel shading technique to represent the game fits perfectly with the light-hearted tone that the developers have decided for Yaiba, being in fact the best way to combine zombies, ninjas and demented Japanese humor. The abandonment of a pseudo-realistic style has paved the way for a cut that is as imaginative and angular as possible, in some cases grotesque but generally endowed with a good identity in stylistic terms, even if technically the graphics appear ~poorer~ than as seen in the previous chapters. The trait is in fact necessarily simple and caricatured, but it manages well to characterize the characters with a style that remains impressed, although the scenarios are characterized by a fluctuating qualitative trend, between fascinating glimpses and other decidedly flat and uninspired sections, which are often accompanied from a lack of depth of level design also in structural terms. The use of colors is also particular, with very saturated and bright tones that create strong contrasts, helping to give the idea of a sort of animated cartoon, a sensation strengthened by the use of cartoons in American comic style to represent some interlude scenes , as well as the comic lettering that accompanies the appearance of enemies and characters with their own names. The choice of the fixed shot frees the player from the task of regulating it autonomously, with the ~camera~ that automatically zooms and moves away according to the situations, however it must be noted that, together with the high speed of the action, it is possible in certain cases lose sight of Yaiba or get stuck due to a somewhat chaotic overview, but it is still a defect to take into account when you find yourself facing dozens of enemies in the same area. The musical accompaniment insists on generally rock tracks, adequate to underline the fast and frenetic action, while the well-made and decidedly ironic and foul-mouthed English dubbing deserves a special mention, which helps to strengthen the ~grindhouse~ style of the production .", "date": "2014-03-18", "grade": "7.0"}
