Sure, the fact that it was free-to-play raised more than a few eyebrows, but there was every reason to look forward to this unique experiment with curiosity. Available in Japan from December, before the western release on April 28, Lost Reavers was in public beta from the 14th to the 26th of the same month, giving us the opportunity to evaluate it thoroughly. The news, unfortunately, is not good. Lost Reavers is an online cooperative multiplayer game for Wii U: the premise was too good... The Raiders of Lost Gameplay That the plot of Lost Reavers is nothing more than a trivial pretext to get us into the heart of the action, at first it doesn't seem like anything bad: in the usual dystopian future with humanity on the brink of extinction for lack of sources of energy, it turns out that there are certain artifacts, the Relics, which are the classic panacea for all the ills in the world. Not only are these miraculous objects found in remote places protected by dozens of frightening and dangerous creatures, but they can only be handled by very few people in the world, the Lost Reavers to be precise. Four people in the world, to be exact. Sayuri is a young Japanese girl who loves to go around in panties and a high school blouse, armed with a katana and a machine gun; Victoria is the classic blonde sex bomb, with provocative clothing and a passion for guns, it doesn't matter whether they are modern automatics or heavy revolvers; then there's Dwayne, a huge ex-marine who can carry a disproportionate number of firearms ranging from assault rifles to sniper rifles up to bazookas and rocket launchers, and finally Shadowstalker, a somewhat sui generis type raised on bread and Friday the 13th, given that his face is covered by a disturbing mask, and that among the objects he never leaves home when he goes out there are a nice machete and a cute shotgun. It is easy to understand how each character gives life to a different style of play: if Sayuri and Shadowstalker will be the choice of those who love healthy hand-to-hand combat, with firearms only for support, Victoria and Dwayne are suitable for battles on the distance. Even Dwayne's default view (there are two for each character, always switchable in real time) is the first person view and transforms the gameplay into that of an FPS, and here comes the first big flaw. While the melee combat is too simplistic and ~ignorant~, with the blow, be it light or powerful that covers a very large area and affects a large number of enemies, the one with firearms is dry and not very fun with the default third person view, even tiring with the first one, with a viewfinder that is never as precise and responsive as we would like; there is an aim assist function but it acts according to its own rules, it is not always possible to activate it, and the result is that the servers are full of Sayuri and Shadowstalkers and very few rely on Victoria and Dwayne for their raids. In short, the initial impact is not the best, also thanks to a level design without a precise direction. There were only two levels available in the beta, but in various versions depending on the level of difficulty: however, it is nothing more than a trivial succession of rooms full of enemies to kill and objects to break to obtain some bonuses, which you can face without knowledge of the cause. The strategic element should arrive when there are obstacles to remove, mechanisms to activate and then above all the Relic to bring back to the starting point: in that case the free elements of the team should protect those who deal with these things, but it's not that this adds a minimum depth to the gameplay which always remains the same, also due to the lack of online chat, at least strange in a game that bases everything on cooperation. Useless progress Going forward, things improve a little. The more advanced levels are different from the first ones, but always the same trivial succession of rooms, but the difficulty actually rises (with too large and clear steps) making the challenges more interesting than the first ones, which can be easily tackled even alone. Sometimes there is also a boss to test our ability to work as a team: again, nNot much strategic planning is required, but at least it's a diversion from the usual countless hordes of undead. An interesting mechanism is that of character progression, which works according to the classic skill point distribution scheme at each level-up: it is possible to create a character that adapts to our style of play by enhancing this or that type of attack or characteristic physics in general. Trying out the new move or skill ultimately turns out to be the biggest push to connect to the server from time to time, and we wish we could say the same thing about the various methods of purchasing and upgrading weapons, armor and items, too, but in this case the progression is extremely slow and expensive. During the beta, microtransactions were not present, however (we leave this consideration with the benefit of the doubt) it seems that the ground is being prepared for their heavy use to obtain bonuses which, when playing, would require an extremely high number of steps for the same level. And if in the end we could also be good with the design of the characters, banal, full of clichs and taken by weight from the minor productions of the 90s - someone might even like it! - we can't make discounts instead to a graphic system that sees the only good things in the modeling of the protagonists and in a few textures. Everything else is trivial, sloppy, the settings are bare and dirty, the details scarce, the animations woody and unrelated to each other. At least the framerate is still acceptable, but we've seen both Unreal Engine 3 and Wii U, despite their backwardness, do much, much better; the same goes for the music, few and of an irritating banality, and for the effects and the few lines of speech of the characters. Finally, the netcode is decent: you may have problems entering a room that is also given as free, this is probably due to the fact that a mission is already in progress in that room but the game does not signal it to us in any way, and disconnection phenomena and a slight, not very influential, lag happen from time to time, but in general the online experience is smooth and fluid.", "date": "2016-04-28", "grade": "5.0"}
