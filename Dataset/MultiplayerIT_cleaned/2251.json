{"name": "Centre Court: Hard Hitter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/centre-court-hard-hitter.html", "text": "McEnroe changes name At first sight he doesn't seem to have changed much but in reality there have been some more or less substantial changes. Center Court is essentially an arcade tennis game, so arcadey that it can't be compared to either Sega's Tennis 2k2 or the highly enjoyable Microids Tennis Master Series coming soon to the Sony console. Some resemblance to the first Virtua Tennis is evident and this can only be a point in favor of a game that has more than one string to its bow. One of the few flaws of Sega Sports' masterpiece is that it doesn't offer the possibility of controlling the strongest and most famous tennis players. Tommy Haas and Cedric Pioline are good tennis players but certainly not the idols of the crowds. Midas wanted to solve this problem by inserting some of the greatest champions of the last 20 years although these have been disguised under purely invented names, not having Center Court ATP and WTA licenses. And so you will be able to control the alter-egos of Pete Sampras, Andr Agassi, Boris Becker and even the legendary John McEnroe who, although they are called Berizzo, Jones and beautiful company, remember in all respects the champions they are inspired by. Tennis enthusiasts will have no trouble recognizing the moves and strokes of real players, recreated almost to perfection. McEnroe's atypical serve, Agassi's powerful backhand, Bum Bum Becker's diving under the net... it seems that nothing is missing. Clay or grass? After choosing your favorite tennis player, you can take part in one of the two game modes available: arcade and exhibition. The first to tell the truth is rather limited, offering the possibility of playing a single tournament by facing all or almost all the other players in short-lived matches. Each match is played on a different surface and therefore after having dirty your shoes with clay, you will have to take the field in succession on concrete, synthetic (indoor) and on the ever-present grass. The most positive notes come from the exhibition mode thanks to which you will have the opportunity to face the computer in a friendly match or challenge your friends in very tight singles or spectacular doubles matches. As in any self-respecting sports game, it is in fact with the multiplayer mode that you get the most fun. Two of the most obvious qualities of Center Court are the immediacy and ease of control. Even without any training session, you shouldn't struggle to execute effective shots both from the baseline and at the net. With the circle button you can execute the classic topspin shot, which you will often use especially in long rallies from the baseline. With the square you can instead try to shorten the duration of the exchange with flat shots, of great power but much more risky as they very often end up on the net or off the field. Instead, the indispensable lob and drop are associated with the triangle and x keys. ~Serve and volley~ is the rule! Center Court certainly does not pretend to want to perfectly recreate the sport of tennis and for this reason the style of play is decidedly arcade. So you shouldn't be surprised to see your player making impossible recoveries at the edge of the grandstand or crushing powerful smashes worthy of the bionic man to the ground. The speed of the exchanges is more than doubled compared to a real game and the result is very appreciable thanks to the frenzy and involvement that derive from it. The various shots of the tennis players have all been well done and this can only give a multiplicity of solutions and variety to the game. Some flaws can still be found but I don't think it affects that much. I certainly wouldn't have minded finding a few more players or a tournament circuit as seen in other games. Precisely for these two reasons, the challenge proposed by Center Court is certainly not infinite and in the long run someone could throw in the towel and quickly forget about this game. We want ~Steak~! Graphically Center Court settles on discrete levels while not making people cry for a miracle. The polygonal models of the players are good even if we have seen better elsewhere, while something more could have been expected from the public and the stands. The animations are instead very good and, even without the now abused motion capture, are surprisingly realistic. Sound certainly does not play a fundamental role in tennis games and indeed here toogoes almost unnoticed. Of the commentary we can only say that Bisteccone Galeazzi probably would have given a little color to the matches and instead we have to be satisfied with the comments (in English) of the official Midas commentator. Game, Set, Match! Center Court: Hard Hitter is definitely a good game and, almost surprisingly, manages to find a worthy place among the best sports titles available for PlayStation 2. Probably in the future the PS2 version of Tennis 2K2 and Namco's Smash Court Pro Tournament will be able to better but for the moment it is right to give credit to what will be the best (and also the only) tennis game for the Sony console for at least a few months. Highly recommended for fans of the beautiful racket sport, a little less for simulation purists. Pros: Simple and immediate Fun Realistic animations Cons: Few modes Not very long-lived if played alone Midas takes the field The arrival of a tennis game is always a particularly awaited event for those who, like me, have lived a good part of their existence on bread and racket. If then this game also proves to be valid then the desire to return to treading the red clay can only be increased, even if only virtually. Fortunately, Center Court: Hard Hitter represents an excellent reproduction of this sport and the promising things said in the preview phase 2 months ago can only be confirmed. In recent weeks I have often inserted the pre-release version of Center Court into my PlayStation 2 between a game of Pro Evolution Soccer and one of NBA Live 2002, each time obtaining 2 or 3 sets of light-hearted but captivating tennis fun. I was therefore waiting with some interest for the arrival of the final version to be able to see if the game, already good previously, had been further improved.", "date": "2002-02-08", "grade": null}
