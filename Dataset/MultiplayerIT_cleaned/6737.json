We will update the review in due course by clarifying these two topics as well. Masahiro Sakurai's twin birth is finally accomplished. After years of work and months after the arrival of his little brother, here comes the most awaited episode, the one on Wii U. Many are waiting for him at the gate. There is so much admiration for the Japanese designer, but satisfying one of the seven most fervent videogames in the world is not easy; and it can't be, for obvious reasons. First of all Sakurai's never hidden desire to share ~his~ creature with as many people as possible, from children to forty-year-old ~pro gamers~, a goal never loved - if not even despised - by those adepts who consider Super Smash Bros. a work, an island where to channel ambitions, successes and emotional frustrations. To complicate everything in this case the concomitant edition for Nintendo 3DS, seen immediately as a potential deterrent to the rise of that housewife. An eventuality that could have been a problem, apart from seven of acolytes: how much would one have limited the other? How much would the little one be an anchor for the big one? Questions that fans have been asking themselves for months, and which now have an answer, a master answer: if Sakurai has such a lively and faithful following, it is not by chance. Nintendo 3DS and Wii U share the control system, interaction between characters and roster, practically the backbone of the game. A framework so valid as to guarantee at the same time a memorable entry into the portable world, and not to limit yet another home iteration. The only effective constraint to which the edition dealt with here was subjected lies in the absence of double (see Ice Climbers) and metamorphic (Zelda/Sheik in a single, dual role) characters; nothing serious. But, above all, the twins have the same title, albeit with different meanings: Super Smash Bros., simply. On Nintendo 3DS, being the first paperback chapter, it needed no further epithets. On Wii U it keeps the stentorian name because, essentially, it represents the definitive reification of the series. Super Smash Bros. comes to Wii U as it has always been, but more complete and rich than ever Super Smash Bros. Before you start getting excited let's specify one thing: by definitive we don't necessarily mean better. We are referring to a project with the ambition to clarify once and for all what Super Smash Bros. is, who it is for, and all in the best form currently attainable. Without daring or risking too much, without trying to move the brand towards unknown shores, without introducing new rules or significant weapons (see Brawl's Final Smash, for example). No: take what has been done so far, balance it as best as possible, polish it and send it to the shelves. With the sole, clear intention of fulfilling the mission already set out above: addressing the widest possible audience. So here comes the scrums for eight (or rather, up to eight players), so as not to keep anyone away from the television, so as to be able to create fun battles even by piling four newbies against an expert player. Here are the Omega arenas, which make each stage attractive to ~pro gamers~ without necessarily having to sacrifice the number of chaotic and dynamic rings. Given the impositions Sakurai has undergone, the crazy working hours declared on the columns of Famitsu and the physical repercussions suffered, and now observed the setting of the game, we are led to believe that this could be his last Super Smash Bros. , the culmination of an adventure that began fifteen years ago. As we said, the basic software is the same as the Nintendo 3DS: dynamic and frenetic fights, the jump to the center of the experience, the need not to fall off the screen in order not to lose points - and not let your opponent gain them. An anomalous fighting game, in which the rival is hit only to make his splash out of the ring more probable, and which has another oddity in the identical formulation of the moves of the various characters: simple, special or smash attacks, although different from a fighter to fighter, they are performed with the pressure of the same buttons. Thus the experience is more immediate - but no less profound - and always, as usual, to be seasoned to one's taste: with or without weapons, with dynamic or static stages, at normal or altered speed/gravity, with a number of variables such as incredibly wide to detach, in this, any other Nintendo production. The speed of the action - predictably - is a worthy balance between frantic Melee and semi-lethargic Brawl. The controllersi are reactive, modifiable and contemplate the use of various pads, including the coupled Wiimote and Nunchuk and the GameCube controller (with appropriate adapter). You can even use Nintendo 3DS, after connection from the menu. As usual, the controls are less soft than in the best EAD games, but the series has proven - from a commercial point of view, at least - not to be affected by them. Beat the CPU As we wrote in our review, the main weak point of the Nintendo 3DS edition, otherwise featuring fluid combat and extremely varied and balanced characters, is the single player mode. This is also, most likely, due to the hardware limits of the platform. On Wii U of course it's a whole other thing, and Sakurai was smart to reveal the differences only after the publication of the portable title. Sure, there are some points of contact: training, trophy hunting, the various stadium exercises (although more numerous on Wii U) which include throwing bombs and bags on athletics tracks. But in addition there are many other options, and the return of ~events~ (also in multiplayer, by the way) is extremely welcome. One of the most popular sections already in Brawl, it is a collection of atypical clashes: Zelda and Link facing a huge Ganondorf, the last Pokmon to challenge all veterans, Samus against her nemesis. Besides being fun and challenging, they guarantee the best possible alternative to the classic comparisons. The missions of Master and Crazy Hand (an absolute novelty) are on the same line, basically potentially infinite battles, of different intensities, altered by the most improbable variables. They are two sides of the same coin: the events are preferable because they are more studied and detailed, the Master Hand requests because they are unlimited and, in the case of Crazy Hand, to be faced with the imminent time. The classic mode has been slightly deviated from the standard, perhaps inappropriately: after all, to boast of the reputation of ~classic~ should imply a certain amount of conservatism. Rather than predicting a path of linear clashes, this time between one battle and another you have the possibility to choose your own path, albeit with mandatory stages. Just like on Nintendo 3DS, the single-player sublimation arrives with the final boss of this section, a mammoth and polymorphic battle, a ravine intended only for daring fighters: you get to the last fight through any level of difficulty, but only at the most extreme ones - and without Game Over antecedents - you enter the authentic clash of the titans. Here further magnified and heroic compared to the Nintendo 3DS - and it was not easy. Overall, therefore, there is a lot to play even alone, although the only truly contestable elements of the software reside precisely in this area: the bonus stages would have deserved to be present again and, above all, Sakurai was not able to create a memorable version of the ~Subspace Emissary~, a sort of scrolling adventure, preferring to do away with it altogether. The ~Smash Tour~, a hybrid with Mario Party, is completely negligible. Arenas and multiplayer On 3DS the great idea of the Omega stages hasn't been fully developed. For the uninitiated, we specify that it is an alternative version of each arena which, regardless of the original conformation, in Omega guise becomes flat, linear and without obstacles - while retaining the starting aspect. A bow to pro gamers, otherwise interned in the usual Final Destination, and at the same time an intelligent solution not to sacrifice the number of chaotic or dynamic stages most appreciated by novices (and not only). On Nintendo 3DS there is still some untapped potential precisely because, in the normal version, many arenas are still too simplistic or small, making the double role almost useless. On Wii U it's the exact opposite. The home edition offers about forty stages - eighty considering the Omegas - and boasts the most varied and well-finished range of battlefields ever seen in a Super Smash Bros. Result obtained by selecting the most suitable rings from previous titles, generally pulling them polished so as to mask their origin, and accompanying them with new stages so dynamic, large and iridescent as to suggest that it would be difficult to do more. Yes, big: it would be better to say gigantic. Only a few of the arenas are playable in the ~eight man scrum~, but none of them are uninteresting when played in twos or fours. The only negative note - but a misstep is forgivable considering the rest - in this field is the speleological area inspired by Kirby, far too vast, sometimes so dispersedto make the characters look more like ants than fighters. The multiplayer as a whole enjoys all the possible advantages inherent to the home platform: two pads are enough and you can collide, without the need for additional copies (obviously). As a tradition in Super Smash Bros., this is where the game gives its best, and surprisingly the eight-wrestler mode is not as instrumental as it might have seemed at the beginning: it is true that in certain situations chaos reigns, it is equally true that it presents very interesting variables. For example, clashes between three teams, each made up of a different pair. Or an aberrant five against one or six against two, in case of great disparity in the capabilities of the contenders. Fluid The customization of the fighters is nice, that of the Mii in the first place, but it comes out greatly weakened because it cannot be used online. And that's a shame, since many of the post-fight rewards correspond to tools for modifying your fighter. All in all, it's a nice addition, but nothing major. The same goes for the level editor, which while on the one hand allows you to design the stages using the touch screen, on the other offers tools, textures and backgrounds that are too limited to be able to create legitimate competition for the main arenas. Impossible to enumerate every secondary feature of the work, simply colossal in the richness of every single brick: the list of trophies, photos and videos to record, old titles to test and possibly purchase on the Virtual Console. The amazing soundtrack, huge, full of remixes of classics from bygone eras, listenable on the jukebox. An excess of content that in the Nintendo panorama is limited to Super Smash Bros., a stylistic trait of Sakurai that has nothing to do with Miyamoto and heirs. The menu does not help to navigate happily among this enormity, with icons rarely proportionate to the importance of the destination: it is not easy to follow the right path among the mass of sub-sections, so much so that finding the list of records (for example) may require more than a few seconds. A venial sin, but it is always a sin. Apart from this, and leaving out the usual, inherent stylistic inconsistency of stages and characters (reduced here to a minimum, as far as possible with a concept of this kind), technically the game is amazing, far beyond expectations. There isn't the same visual gap we saw between Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8, but that's also because Super Smash Bros. Brawl - for a Wii - was equally phenomenal. The generational leap is however evident, above all thanks to the fluidity - obviously not appreciable from the images - with which the game manages that pyrotechnic mass of characters, details and tools that distinguishes the series here, even more than in the past. We have already talked about the music, but further reaffirming their quality, both in the variety of tracks and in their arrangements, certainly does not mean wasting characters. A work to be applauded, for its intentions and realization.", "date": "2014-11-21", "grade": "9.2"}
