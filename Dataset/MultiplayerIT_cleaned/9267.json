If the answer is yes, you will know very well that, even before the rides, magic, the so-called ~air you breathe~, is the main attraction of these theme parks. Anyone who grew up with Disney animated films - and it's impossible that any human being in the Western world hasn't seen at least one in their lifetime - feels transported to a real animated film there. Here, Bandai Namco has kept this potential in mind and you will understand it by reading our review of Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition. Stop everyone: some of you may remember this name, ~Disney Magical World~. By now it is almost a franchise, with the first chapter debuting exclusively on Nintendo 3DS in 2014 and the sequel, Disney Magical World 2, following it in 2016. Especially the second of the two did not arouse particular attention at the time. Hence, perhaps, the desire to take it back and transport it to Nintendo Switch, saving on development costs (and on the search for new ideas) of a hypothetical Disney Magical World 3. On balance, therefore, Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition for Nintendo Switch is the revised and partially improved version of the same game that already appeared almost seven years ago on Nintendo 3DS, with the addition of all the DLC released subsequently. A full-bodied package, addressed and directly designed for the little ones. Living with Mickey and Co In Disney Magical World 2, you can play with Miis Bandai Namco's idea was very clever: to take up the Animal Crossing philosophy and transport it to the Disney world, with some additions in a cinematic sauce and a general simplification of all the mechanics developed over the years by Nintendo. Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition, on balance, is this: a life simulator for children, to play calmly, calmly and without stress, in a world where the most anonymous avatars accompany the most famous Disney faces in the world . Your neighbor, to name one, is Mickey Mouse: but a stone's throw away you will find Donald Duck's boat, Daisy Duck's fashion boutique, Minnie's home, the department stores of Scrooge McDuck and a thousand other activities. The basic objective of the experience is to leave room for the player and amaze him continuously, with a series of events based on Disney animated films. A bit like in Kingdom Hearts, but clearly with very different ambitions, Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition allows you to venture into the most varied worlds: the Hundred Acre Wood of Winnie The Poo, the impossible kingdoms of Alice in Wonderland, the ocean of the Little Mermaid, Captain Hook's boat, and we are only quoting the best known and most predictable. In fact, there are even more interesting extras: Jack Skeletron from Nightmare Before Christmas, the beaches of Lilo & Stitch, Ralph and Vanellope from Wreck-It Ralph, and we don't even want to anticipate too much to those who didn't have the opportunity to play Disney Magical World 2 on Nintendo 3DS. Gameplay: a thousand possibilities Castellopoli dominates the main hub of Disney Magical World 2 Although it is a product designed for the little ones, and - but we already have reservations here - for Disney fans bordering on madness, Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition offers very rich and varied gameplay. Mind you: rich doesn't necessarily mean deep. It is true that you can fish, spend time as you wish, explore Castellopoli in all its buildings and events, take care of the garden, furnish the house, enrich your clothing and change it continuously, buy new items at the stalls, collect, and a thousand other things . But it is also true that we are far from the attention to detail and refinement of any Stardew Valley, a The Sims or the aforementioned Animal Crossing. Which isn't even a problem, because Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition has never wanted to stand up to them; it's just good to keep that in mind. Progression is one of the most interesting aspects of production. There is no plot: simply Mickey Mouse has invited you, via a talking letter, to live in the kingdom of Castellopoli, in the company of the Disney gang. But each character almost immediately will begin to offer you a series of activities, very simple chores that you can complete effortlessly, calmly. Every single action, from putting on an outfit to going to lend a hand to Scrooge, rewards the player with a sticker. The more stickers you have in your possession, the more places you can visit, and the more activities you can access. Therefore, if at the beginning of your adventure you notice that a laboratory is not accessible because it requires somethingat like 40 stickers, don't worry: you'll have them in your beautiful scrapbook in no time. Simply take advantage of every opportunity offered by the title. There are some flaws. If the non-existent basic difficulty cannot be counted among the latter, it certainly annoys a graphics that is not always cured. Nothing to say about the models of the Disney characters, finished and well cared for: but in many other aspects Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition fails to hide its genesis for Nintendo 3DS and its age, which has now exceeded six years. Try to take a look at the lawn behind the protagonist's house and you will notice textures that are anything but captivating; overall, however, the resolution has been increased, since the Nintendo Switch, unlike the Nintendo 3DS, can at least afford high definition. Among the more positive notes, however, we note the recovery of the camera: almost at any time, even during dialogues and cutscenes, it is possible to press the L command to activate the camera, and then shoot with R without interrupting the adventure. The images are saved in the internal memory of the Nintendo Switch, or optionally on the SD card.", "date": "2021-12-25", "grade": "7.2"}
