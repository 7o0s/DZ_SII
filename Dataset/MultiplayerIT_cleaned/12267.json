{"name": "Diddy Kong Racing DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diddy-kong-racing-ds-recensione.html", "text": "1997-2007 The extraordinary nature and uniqueness of DKR within the caricature racing genre, already perceived at the time, is strengthened by the passage of time: no one in ten years has managed to create something as original. The Rare racing was inspired by a structure that has now become archetypal, introduced by Mario Kart, and inserted it within a platform context, decidedly appreciated at the time, thus activating a potentially devastating device. The entire game was set on an island, within which, as well as secrets of various types, various thematic areas were inserted; the latter were characterized by the presence of numerous doors that led to as many runs. In addition to being a sort of primitive cell for the setting - unfortunately taken up only by mediocre games - Diddy was also extravagant in the normality of racing: not only cars, but also races on planes or hovercrafts. More means of transport did not represent a deception but really increased the heterogeneity of the experience, and although the tracks always had a chosen vehicle, almost all of them were also passable with the other two: this is a symptom of a particular care towards the design of the circuits , which not all companies can afford. In addition to all this, the game was long and difficult in single player, particularly accurate in multiplayer battles, finally sweetened by an acceptable range, in relation to the very wide genre, of secrets. The nemesis Diddy Kong's biggest problem, now as then, is Mario Kart. However intriguing and attractive as it is eccentric and original, the Rare game could not compete with the EAD one for speed, precision of controls, variety of driving and in general for all the structural weaves that make Nintendo games unique: the refinement with which each element blends and intersects with others within Mario Kart is not present elsewhere, not even in Diddy Kong. In this sense Diddy has always been second: a very pleasant game based on a good engine, capable of rising from the crowd, a tireless bearer of gameplay, but still a cartridge to be taken into consideration only after sifting through Mario Kart. If this was true on the Nintendo 64 it is even more so on the DS: while Diddy has remained the same, slight alterations aside, Mario Kart has evolved heavily from 1996 to today. The Rare game runs at a constant 30fps, so it's quite slow, and the controls are unchanged from a decade ago, bar some minor simplifications. The differences between the DS version and the Nintendo 64 version essentially lie in the introduction of some sections made specifically for the Touch Screen. In the original it was required to win the same race twice, initially by finishing first, later also collecting eight coins scattered around the circuit - a very difficult task - on DS instead you have to collect balloons and medals from a flying carpet, which moves at within a fixed route, from a first-person shot. These parts, decidedly alien to the rest and more specifically to the motor nature of the game, although not unpleasant in themselves, add nothing to the experience: they have been added in a slightly forced way to take advantage of the touch screen. It's not just these sections that are disappointing, but all those that try to exploit the particularities of the DS: both because they are badly wedged inside a construction that had been erected with reason, and because they do not respond well to the commands. Blowing on the microphone like a madman to get the Hovercraft off quickly is an emblematic way of summarizing the approach that Rare has had, in this case, with the DS: it takes your breath away, but with the wrong means. Elixir Although the main adventure ends before the one on Nintendo 64 (due to the simple parts on the flying carpet) Diddy Kong Racing remains a surprisingly long-lived racing even in its single-player identity. This time there are many extras, all of which can be unlocked by collecting coins in the circuits: from posters to be drawn via the touch screen to the voices of the characters that can be recorded with the microphone, obviously passing through the well-concealed secret characters. Added to this is the most successful introduction of this new episode, or the level editor: nothing particularly articulated or complex, but it tests the player's imagination and allows you to save your circuits. The multiplayer is managed as best it could not, and should be an example for anyone who intends to try their hand at similar ambitions on DS: offline all circuits are playable even with a single cartridge, while the online service is very similar to the one offered by Metroid hunters, voice chat excluded. Going beyond the now obvious and kilometer-long friend codes, it is possible to create games with whoever you want and how you want without too many problems: you can create rooms, so no endless searches in Mario Kart style, and the friends list is able to report who is online and who is not. The only heavy limitation is the small number of runners that you will find connected, unfortunately due to the non-exciting commercial performance of the game. To conclude, the graphic impact is remarkable, less detailed but sharper than on Nintendo 64 (unfortunately, as mentioned before, the game proceeds at 30 fps), while the sound sector is formidable: from the effects to the accompanying music, DKR in this camp is delicious. Despite some constricting introductions due to the desire to exploit the Touch Screen, Diddy Kong Racing remains unchanged in quality after ten years: a great game, built in an original way, capable of entertaining for a long time in both single and multiplayer. It's not Mario Kart, it doesn't have its compactness nor does it guarantee the same depth in driving and managing bonuses, but it is certainly the first alternative and, before that, an extravagant experience that must be done if you love caricatured racing and you missed it the original. The purchase is also recommended if you loved the first one: the online mode, which is also the most intriguing feature for veterans, is intuitive and functional. Atypical Pro Racing Polymorphic experience Long-lasting even in singles Fast and functional online Excellent sound and good graphics ... Cons ... but 30 fps are few Inaccurate and decontextualized Touch Sections Diddy Kong Racing was released on the Nintendo 64 in 1997, thanks to the combined efforts of then laurel-worthy duo Nintendo-Rare. Surprisingly announced and released a short time later, following an at least atypical marketing choice, the racing developed in Britain managed to cheer up the winter of European players, otherwise destined for a season of perennial cold. Diddy Kong Racing on Nintendo 64 was therefore not only a precious cartridge, it was also the right cartridge at the right time: the two connected qualities managed to make it one of the classics of the period. On DS the current situation is quite different from the one that was slowly suffocating the Nintendo 64 ten years ago, just as the average value of Rare games has changed.", "date": "2007-05-21", "grade": null}
