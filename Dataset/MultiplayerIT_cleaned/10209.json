A striking example of this process concerns Assassin's Creed, a title developed by Ubisoft on new generation platforms which, despite the valid premises, failed to garner the appreciation that we would have expected from critics and the public. Assassin's Creed II - precisely its direct sequel - has instead recently collected everything that the predecessor had left on the street, resulting in one of the best products of the entire year. We are now right in front of the latest production of the software house dedicated in this case to Apple iPhone and iPod Touch portable devices, namely Assassin's Creed II Discovery, to understand if once again we can speak of a concrete improvement of the usual sequel compared to the original. The most evident demarcation between the two productions lies in the graphic design, which has substantially changed with the Discovery chapter. The first, in fact, consisted of a solid three-dimensional graphics engine, while Assassin's Creed II Discovery, in a certain sense, takes a small step backwards, presenting a three-dimensional environment which can however only be traversed horizontally, and therefore, in fact, capable of offer an experience in only two dimensions. The exception The impact is therefore slightly destabilizing, by virtue of the change in appearance which inevitably also affects the gameplay. The albeit limited exploration phase is set aside in favor of a more frenetic action devoted to speed of execution, excellently married to the classic touch interface which is also characterized by a prompt response to requests. Through a simple tutorial you are catapulted into the adventure that sees Ezio as the protagonist through his journey. It is interesting to note that although there is a lack of a ~third space~ for movement, the gameplay is equally enjoyable thanks to the fights, which can be tackled face-to-face or in ~stealth~ mode, and the platform phases, very captivating especially for the speed in which they take place and the promptness/precision necessary for their fulfilment. At the same time, with the continuation of the story, a certain repetitiveness takes over, both for the missions and for the activities, a certainly not commendable defect for an application that does not guarantee more than a few hours of play. Assassin's Creed II Discovery is therefore a pure scrolling adventure sweetened by fighting and a strong platform component, as in the past, but mutilated by that depth, although not extraordinary, which had characterized the first Assassin's Creed anyway. However, there are several improvements. Graphically, the two dimensions allow excellent fluidity, giving the frame rate security and solidity that are certainly absent in the first chapter. The setting is quite inspired, and gives due weight to what has been one of the great appreciations on the most famous versions for new generation consoles. Small final note for the options, within which there is a photo gallery that contains the wallpapers unlocked during the story, which can be saved directly in the photo section of the iPhone or iPod Touch to be used as all other shots in the camera roll, and therefore with the same possibilities. Assassin's Creed II Discovery is available on the App Store at a price of 5.49 euros. The tested version is 1.0.1 App Store links", "date": "2010-02-08", "grade": "6.5"}
