It has already been done, in this and many other places. After all, text folders could be consumed simply by indulging in comparisons and comparisons between the two brands, and putting on blinders in the review phase ignoring the enormous inspiration of SuperBot Entertainment's fighting game would require a considerable mental effort. Whatever those belonging to one or the other side say, it is still necessary to evaluate PlayStation All-Stars in its uniqueness, contextualizing it to the platform it belongs to, its history and its limitations, and this is why we will not call into question the Nintendo franchise if not for one last fundamental consideration. Unlikely fistfights Whether you play it on PS3, on Vita, or maybe on both at the same time, it makes little difference: it takes a few hours and several matches to realize how much, under a clearly derivative surface, PlayStation All-Stars is an absolutely unique title, and not only to be the only one to bring together in one fighting game some of the most iconic icons seen on Sony consoles. A concise tutorial gives the player all the tools needed to choose their favorite character and immediately jump into the Arcade mode, the traditional climb that sees the chosen hero face a series of opponents up to the challenge with the final boss. In this case, a simple story told through static illustrations was created for each fighter, a solution which however is quite disengaged and devoted to saving, unlike the nice interludes created with the game engine and which precede the fight with one's rival: from this point of view, one cannot help but smile seeing Big Daddy bickering with Sackboy, or Sweet Tooth picking on Kratos to death, while everyone tries to remain consistent with the character of their character. However, these are sequences that last a few seconds, because in the blink of an eye you find yourself punching three other opponents. Once you enter the battle, what immediately emerges from the chaotic brawls is the accessibility of the controls, intuitive but far from trivial: between dodging, jumps, parries and three attack buttons (combinable with the directions of the stick), the game manages to entertain both the obsessive-compulsive button-masher and those who prefer a more tactical and elaborate approach, made up of holds, cancels and chained techniques. In this regard, the Trials and Tutorial options are an excellent tool for practicing with each fighter and mastering his attacks to perfection. The most characteristic element of the gameplay, however, is represented by the system with which the score is calculated, since, in the absence of an energy bar, none of the challengers can be eliminated with traditional shots. The only way to bring home a point is to cause enough damage to fill a particular gauge and thus unleash a special attack, all the more devastating the higher its level. Spike, for example, uses a powerful laser to instantly eliminate all opponents, Sweet Tooth transforms into a gigantic mech, while Dante enters Devil Trigger mode and can make a clean sweep by slicing everything he can for a limited time find in front. Considering that landing a Super attack is the only way to eliminate an enemy and earn a point, it is evident that this system is both the cross and the delight of the whole experience. If on the one hand the effort of the developers in characterizing each character by giving them the most recognizable techniques and abilities (Kratos for example draws from all the chapters for consoles and those for PSP) is certainly to be appreciated, there is no doubt that diversifying such different fighters has had a on balancing them. Thus we find ourselves with some characters equipped with a level 1 or level 2 Super attack capable of easily wiping out multiple opponents together, which clearly discourages choosing particular fighters in online competitions and largely ruins the balance within the rosters. As if that weren't enough, there were still some problems that emerged during the public beta, with Radec which, despite the controversies about excessively annoying and ~unfair~ techniques, seemed even faster and more powerful than before. However, it must be said that our online test was limited to a short session in the company of other journalists, and that the tiers and strategies will certainly be better defined as soon as the game is ihand to the community of players. Playstation 3 trophies For lovers of easy Trophies, PlayStation All-Stars is a real boon: a large part must be unlocked simply by finishing the Arcade mode or playing with a specific character in a particular arena, while even the most atypical Trophies are easily obtainable in a few hours. A platinum gift, in short. Half a tribute One of the most interesting aspects that emerged in our previous meetings with PlayStation All-Stars is certainly linked to the dynamic design of the arenas, and now that we have finally had access to all the remaining scenarios we can only reconfirm the excellent work done by the development team. Whether you play in the colorful Franzea of LocoRoco, in the Enchanted Landscape of LittleBigPlanet or in the Paris of Sly Cooper, each setting is completely transformed, including elements taken from different games that blend more or less coherently with each other. It certainly makes an impression to start a battle in PaRappa the Rapper's funny dojo and find yourself a few moments after the seabed full of Helghast drones and mechs, although the enormous vivacity of the seabed can in some cases distract the eye from the action: in the most in fact, excited, it is easy to lose sight of your character and find him thrown on the other side of the arena, which we actually found not so much on PS3 as on the Vita screen. However, owners of the Sony portable console should not be discouraged, because except for some missing graphic effects, the two versions of PlayStation All-Stars are absolutely identical in feeling and content. Those who then have both consoles can fully enjoy the game thanks to the cross-play and cross-save functions, which allow not only to challenge other players online regardless of the platform in their possession, but also and above all to carry on the same and identical gaming experience both from your living room and on the go. It's just a pity that, both online and offline, the variety of options proposed is really scarce, with players who can challenge each other only in Free-for-All or 2v2 matches and with the only victory conditions linked exclusively to the time of the match or the number of totalized kills . Trials mode itself is nothing more than an extension of Training, and the single-player experience inevitably ends up becoming repetitive and unrewarding. Unfortunately, it is precisely in this lack of stimulation that the greatest flaw of PlayStation All-Stars lies: since all the characters and all the arenas are available from the beginning, there is nothing that really makes you want to play and replay the game. Arcade mode with each of the characters, and the only unlockable content comes down to little stuff, like small icons, some pets, secondary costumes and alternative poses. Before that, SuperBot Entertainment's fighting game fails to properly celebrate PlayStation, a brand that now has almost twenty years of history and which has hosted some of the most important sagas ever. A narrow biography of each of the fighters on the roster is all that the developers have managed to do from an encyclopedic point of view, and even the same Polygon Man, the first PlayStation mascot and present here as the final boss, is not deigned to no description, making it appreciable only to the most attentive longtime players. While Super Smash Bros. manages to pay homage to Nintendo and its fans with an extremely self-celebratory title, what seems to be missing from PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale is precisely the sense of cohesion and belonging to the same flag. Accomplice is certainly a roster with a less important story (although charismatic Nariko does not have the same fame as Samus, and Cole cannot compete when compared to Link), yet what is clear is that the developers have wasted a unique opportunity to tell the magnificent biography of PlayStation and give the fans what they truly deserve.", "date": "2012-11-21", "grade": "7.5"}
