The title developed by Tipsworks, released last year on iOS and Android, had the extraordinary merit of bringing a true soulslike experience to mobile, i.e. devoid of the mostly structural features that are generally found in products designed for mobile use . Characterized by a very fascinating dark fantasy setting and interesting characters, although often penalized by a disappointing narrative, the game would not have disfigured on PC and consoles in terms of level design, variety of enemies and total duration (which, also considering the two DLCs included in this Definitive Edition, goes towards fifteen hours): that's exactly what we wrote in the review of Pascal's Wager in the Android version. Pascal's Wager: Definitive Edition, a fight sequence with Terrence. After that it is clear and evident that a project capable of standing out clearly in a context completely devoid of real rivals, the mobile one, can face some major difficulties when it makes the leap from platform, arriving on PC and putting itself inevitably in competition (albeit net of a budget price of 19.99 euros) with franchises of the caliber of Dark Souls and Nioh. What were the merits of Pascal's Wager remain so, but compared to this new dimension they take on a necessarily lower relevance, passing under the traditional X-rays of an analysis that becomes fiercely comparative and which cannot do without considering the many experiences more solid and refined that can be accessed on the same gaming system. With that cleared up, let's get started. History Pascal's Wager: Definitive Edition, the mysterious and disturbing Norwood grappling with an opponent. The story of Pascal's Wager: Definitive Edition catapults us into a disturbing world, in some ways similar to that of the unforgettable Soul Sacrifice, enveloped in a cursed fog that plunged it into darkness. To illuminate this eternal night there are only the globes of dim light placed on top of the corpses of the titans: enormous creatures that once protected human beings, but which have become extinct due to a mysterious plague. The protagonist of the adventure, Terrence, is a knight who served the Church for years, but abandoned the order when his partner was accused of witchcraft. Tormented by guilt, he decides to find out what happened to him and on his journey he meets four brave characters who will join him. Pascal's Wager: Definitive Edition boasts well-designed levels, with passages and secrets to discover. It's about Norwood, a mysterious one-armed warrior who fights brandishing a small coffin; Viola, a charming hunter armed with a bayonet; Benita, a sort of priestess without sight but able to defend herself with a chain; and finally Jerrold, included in the Definitive Edition: a very shrewd swordsman. Terrence can form a couple with each of these fighters, selecting them on the carriage that takes us to each scenario of the campaign. We will therefore have the possibility to switch from one protagonist to another, having two lives to manage as we see fit: a significant help for a soulslike, but not the only element with which to calm the degree of difficulty of the experience . Gameplay Pascal's Wager: Definitive Edition, an early boss fight. On the gameplay front, Pascal's Wager: Definitive Edition is a classic action RPG, which renounces some aspects (weapons and equipment cannot be picked up or changed, with the only exception of items that act as upgrades) in favor of the more classic ones for the soulslike sub-genre. Specifically, we are talking about stages with watertight compartments, which reward exploration and allow you to retrace short stretches by grinding to level up, stopping at the traditional sanctuaries where you can rest (restoring all killed enemies), create any potions (including one for sanity, essential after a certain number of clashes to avoid sinking into madness and determining relevant penalties) and use the pieces of bone obtained to enhance character characteristics such as strength, health, stamina and so on. Pascal's Wager: Definitive Edition, Benita grappling with a creepy man-horse. The combat system provides for almost all the protagonists the possibility of parrying blows, dodging and using two types of attack, light and heavy, to be combined in variousways once unlocked new maneuvers that enrich our repertoire. It is not possible to run, which is sometimes irritating, but the aforementioned connotation of the scenarios avoids excessive backtracking and therefore limits the importance of moving quickly. Then there are the enemies, which as mentioned boast a great variety: the types are many and all have peculiar attack patterns that must be memorized in order to respond effectively, obviously including the many bosses who close the levels and allow us, once defeated, to return to the carriage to head to the next destination. Technical realization The broad preamble of the review also and above all applies to the technical realization of Pascal's Wager: Definitive Edition, extraordinary (in the literal sense of the term) on mobile but inevitably limited and dated on PC. Stylistically, the game holds its ground and the characterization of characters and enemies is often excellent, but the assets of the scenarios are often generic and there are many precautions in terms of pure and simple direction that required a little polishing, but which instead we find unchanged in this Definitive Edition. The new version is therefore limited to increasing resolution and frame rate, where support for the controller was already present on mobile, providing us with a handful of options to scale the experience depending on the hardware. Curiously, on an RTX 3070 the game fails to be consistent at 2160p and 60 frames, showing a little too many uncertainties that we imagine will be fixed with the next updates.", "date": "2021-03-15", "grade": "7.0"}
