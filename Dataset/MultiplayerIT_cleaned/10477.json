{"name": "FIFA 10", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71159-fifa-10-un-fifa-anche-per-liphone.html", "text": "History repeats itself: wherever EA Sports' Fifa is, there's always a contender, a challenger ready to fight for the throne of the best football title. But while on consoles this competition has been linked to the name of Pro Evolution Soccer by Konami for many years, on the contrary on the iPhone the best product of the genre is in the hands of the French Gameloft, with that Real Football which in its 2010 version was recently reviewed on these pages. But now that Fifa has made its debut on Apple hardware, who will be declared the winner? A touch of class What Fifa 10 certainly does not lack, as per tradition, are the numbers: 30 championships, 570 teams and almost 13,000 players with official licenses and numerous modalities are very respectable figures, which lay the foundation for a title that certainly in the ~outline leaves room for little criticism. Possibly sorry for the absence (it seems momentary) of an online multiplayer, given that to challenge real opponents you have to limit yourself to local challenges, but given the not entirely successful attempt in this sense of Real Football 2010 probably the times are not they are mature. But obviously beyond all these ancillary elements, it is in the gameplay that the interest is focused, especially in the face of the fact that so far no football title has really managed to convince on the iPhone. Basically we can say that, even with Fifa 10, the situation is not destined to change much; in the face of some convincing aspects, there are in fact others that leave a bad taste in the mouth and prevent the EA Sports product from establishing itself as an obligatory purchase. Obviously the focal point is the control system, cross and delight of the Apple device. Also in this case it was decided to create an analog stick and two virtual keys, but unlike other products the two keys do not appear at all sufficient to support the variety of actions available, to the point that the programmers have decided to implement a strange solution; in summary, to execute the through ball in attack or the slide in defense, you need to drag your finger from one button to another. A short-lived compromise and that it never becomes convincing even after practicing through numerous matches; the same goes for the double tap required for crosses and long passes, really cumbersome and unsatisfactory. It would certainly have been more effective and logical to add a third virtual key to the layout, but unfortunately this was not the case; or rather this actually happens, but only if you choose the questionable player control system via accelerometer. In fact, with this option the elusive third button appears, delegated however simply to the race. A design error that significantly affects an otherwise discreet product; the basics are evidently those of the previous episodes for N-Gage, certainly not destined to end up in the annals for their quality, but progress on the iPhone is sensitive. The players move quite fluidly and reactively, certainly better than the rail race of Real Football 2010, and the variety of actions allow to guarantee a good number of solutions available to the player. The artificial intelligence, both of companions when you opponents, is all in all sufficient except for the goalkeepers, who can often be overcome with the same actions and with shots that are anything but unstoppable. The defensive phase can be reviewed, in which with difficulty you manage to snatch the ball from your opponents due to a lack of physicality of your athletes. From a technical point of view we sincerely expected more; the polygonal models have very unnatural features, and the similarity with the real counterparts varies between scarce and completely absent. Even the sound component can be reviewed, especially for the noise of the repetitive if not annoying stadium. The tested version is 1.0.1", "date": "2009-10-09", "grade": "9.3"}
