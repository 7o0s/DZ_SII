Instead we were forced to change our mind and, despite some problems, it is impossible not to admit that it is an excellent real-time strategy game. Especially in lean times like these, it will surely delight fans of the genre. In a certain sense, Destructive Creations' signature is not lacking, given that it is particularly gory and brutal both in terms of graphics and in terms of difficulty, but fortunately Ancestors Legacy also has many other qualities to show off. Game content As soon as the game is started, you have to choose whether to play online or in one of the single player campaigns present. There are currently six of the latter, with two more on the way. The developers' goal is to have two for each of the four factions, all well characterized: Vikings, Anglo Saxons, Germans and Slavs. Each campaign is made up of five missions: considering that each mission can last even more than an hour, it's not difficult to calculate that even now, to finish them all, you have to play for well over twenty hours. The calculation is approximate but takes into account the fact that the tutorial campaign, i.e. the first of the Vikings, is slightly shorter than the others, as are the first missions of each campaign. The other single player mode on offer is Skirmish, which is identical to every other skirmish mode seen in other RTSs, with players having to fight to grab the map's resources and destroy the bases of opponents who obviously aim to do the same. If desired, it is also possible to fight for the accumulation of points, awarded by conquering and maintaining the various bases (in this case, villages). If we want the skirmish mode also gives a taste of what Ancestors Legacy is online, nothing more, nothing less, with obviously the human players adding a lot to the fun. In any case, it is clear that the focus of the product is on the single player, where the best insights are found and where it is possible to really experience all the game systems. Historical campaigns The campaigns we mentioned above are all based on real historical events, obviously re-read to be adapted to the game. The setting is very medieval, with the various missions all set around the year one thousand (say from the end of 900 AD, until 1200 AD). It is interesting that the developers have also chosen to reproduce battles that are not exactly very famous, but which make the sense of what a war between tribes or very small factions meant in the Middle Ages better than the field ones. Of course, don't expect real history lessons, but at least here, in addition to seeing very large armies fight in the open field, you will discover that often at the time the ~battles~ looked more like raids by small groups of marauders, with the aggressors who, moreover, tried to act with a certain circumspection before acting. Each campaign is introduced by hand-drawn narrative inserts that present the historical scenario, inserts that also underpin the various missions, in order to contextualize them properly. In terms of gameplay Ancestors Legacy is a cross between a classic real-time strategy like Command & Conquer and a more tactical one like the Company of Heroes. Each mission has its own objectives, which in order to be achieved require you to take advantage of the various functions from time to time. Thus, for example, in some missions it is necessary to conquer and develop one or more villages to train troops and form an army (for a maximum of ten units); in others you have to move circumspectly around the map, perhaps using the other grass to hide and trying to free captured troops to then bring them into battle; in still others you have to cross very dangerous areas with a handful of men, and then defend yourself from the constant assaults of the enemies by perhaps developing a village. In short, there is variety and, although some situations tend to repeat themselves during the campaigns, the sense of repetitiveness is very low. Combat After all, so much variety has required some sacrifices in some aspects of the game, such as in the construction of villages, in which the system chooses the positioning of the buildings and in which the development of technologies for the various units is quite limited. The actual combat is much more refined which, although based on the classic ~rock, paper and scissors~ system, offers several interesting tactical ideas. For example, it must be considered that melee units cannot be disengaged after engagement, while archers and crossbowmen areno longer versatile and can be made to move at any time. You should also take into account the retreat button which allows troops, in case things are going badly, to flee to a safe area or to the nearest base. In this way it is possible to treat the wounded and, if you have a barracks, to reinvigorate the ranks. In addition to the regular troops (spearmen, warriors, knights, archers and so on), there are also special troops, the heroes, the latter usually the historical characters who are the protagonists of the campaign. Heroes are particularly powerful troops, unique in having a single energy bar, but not invincible (don't expect to be able to pass a level relying on them alone). They have activated special abilities capable of affecting the entire army: for example they can instill courage in the troops, or they can increase their aggressiveness, or they can still terrorize the opposing units forcing them into a momentary flight and more. In general, the gameplay of Ancestors Legacy requires you to be particularly active, because the artificial intelligence is among the most aggressive seen in the genre: in some maps, the attacks continue unabated and leave very little time to take countermeasures. To make it all the more difficult, the resources, which are limited and sometimes difficult to find, make it all the more difficult. In short, food, timber and iron are found in scarce quantities, often just what is needed to achieve the given objectives, and must be managed carefully. In particular, food must never be lacking, on pain of the morale collapse of the army with subsequent defections. All this translates into a really high challenge, even if you select the medium difficulty level (there are three), which will put newbies to the test in particular. Brutal but not too smart That said, it must be said that Ancestors Legacy is not a product without flaws. Meanwhile, the aforementioned artificial intelligence is yes aggressive, but also very obtuse and limits itself to attacking head on without making major tactical assessments. Thus it is not difficult to make it end up in our traps or to make it flow into the various funnels of which the maps are often scattered (bridges, gates and so on), where it obviously ends up losing the advantages given by numerical superiority or by the initial deployment. The problems of artificial intelligence are also clearly visible in the allies (when the missions foresee them), who are hardly able to offer the necessary support, obviously beyond the battles in which they act according to pre-established schemes. Another limitation of the game is the lack of real novelties. Destructive Creations has done its job well, but hasn't introduced strong elements that distinguish it from the competition, brutality aside. Nothing too dramatic, given that in 2018 there are very few of us left to consider the originality of a video game as a value. From a technical point of view, Ancestors Legacy stands out above all for the bloody animations, which make the fights particularly tasty, above all thanks to the possibility of entering the action with the camera (otherwise fixed), following the individual units. Unreal Engine 4 has been used well even though, apart from blood, there's nothing that really stands out. The best element is probably the fire that flares up from the buildings when they are attacked by troops, fire linked to the conquest mechanic which requires you to burn village halls to take control of them. For the rest, we are faced with a product that has been carefully cared for and nothing more, that is, one that does not stand out for its style or richness of detail.", "date": "2018-05-29", "grade": "8.0"}
