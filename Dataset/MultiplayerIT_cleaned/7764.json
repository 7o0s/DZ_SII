The result should be a series of agile, imaginative, innovative and fun games, and it can be said that, all in all, it has always been successful: despite ups and downs, in fact, we still haven't tried a title from the two series that was really disappointing. So when one reads the name of Keiji Inafune and his young Comcept, certainly the most important designer among those involved in Level 5, the best known in the West, the father of Mega Man, Onimusha and Dead Rising and among the creators of other great Capcom successes such as various Resident Evil and Street Fighter, it is inevitable that expectations rise beyond the guard levels; in the same way, when these expectations are at least partially betrayed, it is inevitable that the disappointment will make itself felt stronger than normal. Garden Nazis Bugs vs. Tanks! part four, and in the decidedly sui generis narrative premises it fully respects the unwritten dictates of the Level 5 compilations: we are in the early 1940s, in the midst of World War II, and an entire German Panzer-Division is found overnight completely miniaturized, soldiers, camp and tanks; he must thus go from fighting the Allied armies to perhaps even more fearsome enemies, namely a whole series of monstrous insects that have now assumed gigantic dimensions. Let's make a small aside: believe it or not, the fact that in this title they impersonate Nazi soldiers (even if you will never find swastikas or other explicit references to Adolf Hitler's nefarious doctrine) has sparked a small controversy, especially in the United States : for our part we can only record that the game is so full of humor (the head of the division, for example, a very stereotypical Aryan colonel convinced that the fate he and his men met is due to who knows what diabolical weapon in the hands of the Allies, and who harangues the soldiers before each mission with coarse nationalist rhetoric, only to then go and lock himself up in the safety of his own tent), that the suspicion of apology raised by some star-spangled commentators finds very little foundation. But let's go back to our heroes: from what was a war for world domination they find themselves projected, we said, into a daily battle for survival, and along a series of missions (about thirty plus some bonuses to unlock) they will have to achieve various objectives , from simple exploration to stocking up on water, food or material to secure the camp, hindered by a whole series of creatures that have now become extremely lethal. The insects that we find along our way are really many, starting from every imaginable type of ant, passing through the aviation represented by bees and company, up to the fearsome spiders that trap us in their webs, and the work done in the give each beast precise characteristics of mobility, strength, defense capacity and so on; however, being a Panzer-Division that found itself miniaturized, it can have its say with a whole series of armored vehicles that actually existed at the material time. We start with only one model available, but as time and missions go by, new tanks will be added to our collection, both Axis and Allied, which can also be assembled (the turret of one, the body of another and so on) to give life to the definitive, fast, resistant and powerful panzer; here too, good job both on the number of crawlers and on their characteristics, as well as on historical accuracy. On closer inspection, the variety of vehicles and opponents is perhaps the greatest value of Bugs vs. Tanks!, which continues to build solid foundations even with the game system that is much deeper than the simple control system, with the turret that can be controlled separately from the tank, can suggest. First of all, there are two control systems, which then correspond to two different levels of difficulty: the automatic one will take care of the cannon alone, for a quick and simple style of play, the manual one instead assigns the fire to the R backbone, and in this This way the challenge immediately becomes much higher, having to take into account both the impossibility of shooting rapidlytion one shot after another, and the fact that it is not enough to align the cannon to the enemy to hit him, but it is also necessary to calculate the different levels at which the tank and the insect can find themselves, with the most difficult maps full of various height differences. As if that weren't enough, two different types of projectiles complete the picture (the most powerful explosive ones, the piercing ones that can hit multiple beasts in a row) to choose from before each mission, and the possibility, one for each stage, to call other tanks to the rescue to get out of particularly delicate situations. The 3D effect In a decidedly not the best technical context, the well-crafted stereoscopic effect is a sort of lifeline. With its predictable focus on damned bugs, it also reaches decent levels of showmanship when bees, wasps and singing company enter the picture; it does not affect the overall acceptable fluidity, and therefore it is an aspect of the game to be promoted. Moscow is not only the Soviet capital... Also present is multiplayer for up to 4 players, which is clearly fun but which is only possible locally and only with a copy installed on each 3DS, greatly limiting the possibility of exploiting it as it should, as well as a nice Streetpass mode which allows us to have available, meeting other owners of the game, more than one allied rescue for each mission. So many elements in play, a large series of missions, rather short but which can be really difficult if desired and which among other things can be replayed to obtain the best possible evaluation, a collection-game soul, a more deeper than you might think... What's wrong then, you're rightly wondering; anticipating the comment a little, we tell you that the answer is the simplest imaginable, all of which does not seem very funny to us. The exploration of the labyrinthine maps fails to take as much as it should, the clashes with insects are playfully limited with the ~simple~ control, even too difficult and frustrating with the manual one; tedium soon takes over and takes away the brilliance even to what could be the attractions, collecting tanks, the unraveling of the amusing story, obtaining high scores. In general, it is not understood what Bugs vs. Tanks wants to be: too slow and complicated to be a fast and fun arcade, its tactical and simulation elements too limited and bland to be something deeper. The graphic component doesn't help at all, among the worst things ever seen on 3DS even in the eShop area: insects are saved, thanks to good modeling, decent animations and also clean textures; however, already the tanks, which are realistic in their construction, suffer from very dirty textures, and the game environment is a real disaster, devoid of details and above all soiled by textures of the ground, i.e. those that will dominate the upper screen of the console 90% of the time, unwatchable. Finally, the sound is without infamy or praise, with a few military marches and effects between the sympathetic and the realistic; funny, however, the voices of the Germans, in line with the whole ~surrounding~ department of Bugs vs. Tanks!, definitely the most refined of the package. Despite the good premise, Bugs vs. Tanks! turns out to be uninteresting and lacking real bite.", "date": "2013-07-01", "grade": "6.0"}
