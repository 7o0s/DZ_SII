In reality, the differences are very minimal, so much so that this choice is not really understood, perhaps made to maintain a now salient feature of the franchise. We want to underline immediately that the technical aspect is rather mediocre: the title seems in fact conceived and developed more for a Game Boy Advance than for a Nintendo DS, maintaining the already spartan graphic sector of the prequel, which proposes moderately animated sprites of modest size, absolutely standard graphics is a color palette that certainly does not cry out for a miracle. There is the sympathy of Pokmon, without a doubt, but Pokmon Diamond & Pearl are technically much more sophisticated and current: Pokmon Mystery Dungeon, on the other hand, simply seems old. The same sensation is sharpened in the various ~dungeons~ to be explored, automatically generated and rather poor in planimetry and detail: a series of corridors, crossroads and curves are incessantly repeated to give shape to places that are a bit too similar to each other, and the routine that manages the random creation of each floor is rather bland, so much so that sometimes we find ourselves with the goal to be reached practically alongside. The jingles and tunes are remixes of the main series that remain pleasant and never annoying, nothing to complain about: they are a rather apt seasoning for a very simple narrative line, which sees our alter-ego mysteriously transformed into a pokmon (whose race will be generated on the basis of the answers we will give to an initial questionnaire) and subsequently committed to working for a sort of ~guild~ together with other allied pokmon to carry out missions of various kinds in an attempt to find out what happened and how to become human again. Mystery and suspense or almost The concept behind Pokmon Mystery Dungeon is disarmingly simple and tends to become repetitive very quickly: in practice, we will choose the missions to complete and explore the dungeon involved, defeating the pokmon that will block our way to reach our goal. The fights have a strange mix between turn-based and real-time mechanics: essentially every one of our actions will involve one of the opponent, whether it is a move, the use of an object or an attack. Of course, the special attacks, skills and objects of the main series have been maintained, so those who have already played Pokmon will feel at home browsing the menus and recognizing the various terminologies, also reimplanting in this spin-off. However, the difference from the ~classic~ fights of the mother series is felt: everything appears much simpler and less strategic, and the management of our alter-ego and his adventure companion is as immediate as it is basic. However, the ease of the game should not mislead: the level of difficulty is well balanced, and one does not get the impression of playing a title that is too easy or with insanely high levels of difficulty. Much more difficult, however, to use the stylus: the implementation of the touch-screen is really incomplete, and the use of the D-Pad is much more intuitive and precise. Also this time Chunsoft among other things proposes the remote ~rescue~ system already present in the prequel, refined for the occasion in order to exploit the wi-fi capabilities of the Nintendo DS: if we are defeated in a dungeon, we will be able to send a request rescue to another player who can come and save us. The mechanism, very simple and decidedly naive, naturally also works in reverse, and it will be possible to receive requests for help that we can accept or ignore. Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time & Explorers of Darkness is available for Nintendo DS. The tested version is Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time. Comment Obviously Pokmon Mystery Dungeon is mainly intended for a very young audience, presenting an almost essential and cyclical gameplay that tends to become repetitive in a few hours for an occasional user, where perhaps a Nintendo monster lover will be able to appreciate it for the duration of the game. 'main adventure (the plot is not bad at all). Nonetheless, the technical realization is just sufficient and comparable to the performance of a Game Boy Advance, a choice that cannot be justified by the product's target. With greater care in the creation of the dungeons and the graphic aspect, we could have held in our hands a game that cannot be classified as a modest spin-off that focuses on the fame of the very famous Pokmon. Pro Original idea (at leastsecond time only) Enjoyable plot Pokemon always have their charm Cons Extremely repetitive Poorly implemented touch screen Technically backward Since its debut on Game Boy Advance (also published for Nintendo DS) the Pokmon Mystery Dungeon series has proposed itself as an offshoot of the mother series, perhaps addressed to a smaller audience due to the playful mechanics and the topics covered. Despite the appeal exercised on the children's audience, the original Pokmon series has always been characterized, in depth, by a complex gameplay full of decidedly difficult variables for the most tender age. Mystery Dungeon was conceived as a particular alternative, in which the player does not play the role of the usual Pokmon trainer, but a real little monster (or rather, the little monster into which the human being was transformed at the beginning of the adventure ) and this involves an unprecedented approach to the world of Nintendo monsters, with whom you can now converse and embark on various adventures, exploring their micro-world. A good idea, which Chunsoft, developer of the series, has not been able to master completely.", "date": "2008-07-24", "grade": null}
