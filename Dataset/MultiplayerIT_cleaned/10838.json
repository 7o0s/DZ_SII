The problem is that we are dealing with a remake of a game that came out, on the Super Famicom, in 1992, and which then also boasted a first remake in 2004 on the PlayStation 2. This might not even be of particular interest to us , were it not for the small detail that the game in question is Dragon Quest V, perhaps the most beautiful episode of Japan's most important saga, certainly an essential title for anyone with even a vague interest in the genre. It was time! What makes a JRPG great? It's a question that has its good reason to be asked, given the peculiarity of the genre. Everyone has his own theory, there are those who put the plot before everything, those who want characters characterized as not even Shakespeare could do, those who still care about all this and want an incredible, vast and detailed world, those who are fanatical of a properly done combat system, who wants to level, level and just level... Well, with DQV the problem doesn't arise, this game has (almost) everything. There is a reason why this saga has even more followers at home than Final Fantasy, a reason that we Westerners have been learning to appreciate with a certain constancy only for a few years, after the first, very pale attempts, and the fifth episode exemplifies it perfectly. Do you want the story? Well: in DQV you play a Hero who has to save the world, much the same as in about a billion other games. Except that you will follow this hero from his carefree childhood in the company of his very loving father / mentor to adulthood, when it will be a question of starting a family and having children of his own. And in the midst of all this episodes, details, events, turns, twists, characters that, before experiencing firsthand, you can only imagine. Design? As in all Dragon Quests, none other than Akira Toriyama draws and gives a soul to everything, whose stroke may not be appreciated by everyone but who undoubtedly presents himself here in splendid form. And speaking of this, are you interested in a significant graphic impact? The DS remake, despite using a completely different engine (the same as DQIV), does not make you regret the PS2 version! Of course, various expedients have been used, such as the return to a bird's eye shot, the characters remaining in (excellent) 2D, obviously on closer inspection the quality of the textures and the number of polygons are not even comparable, but the The impact, also made by the possibility of varying the angle of the camera as desired, remains of great value. And maybe you also want some unforgettable musical compositions? DQV had them, and La Sposa del Destino also has them, which indeed impresses, headphones in the ears, for the technical quality of some songs, first of all the historic Main Theme of the saga. The monsters are throwing a party tonight But here at Multiplayer.it, as we know, in the end we pay particular attention to the substance, that is to say, speaking of video games, to the gameplay. Introducing the structure of any Dragon Quest to an audience that has had very few opportunities to access it is easy as long as you have to remember all the cornerstones of the genre, also because the same saga helped create them, it becomes difficult however when you wants to go and touch on all the particularities and ~oddities~, in some cases even minimal but still evident, which differentiate DQ from, for example, Final Fantasy, and which perhaps are the basis of Enix's policy which for many years has preferred not to bear the costs and risks of expatriation. We could say that DQ has a slightly (but just a hair, huh!) less linear map than we are used to, that the combat system is firmly rooted in the past, when clashes with monsters were really difficult, as well as more traditionalist it is also in the experience system, in the management of the party, of the equipment and of the spells which, thanks to the belonging of this specific episode to the 90s, are simpler and more linear than usual, and it is not certain that this must be a disadvantage: it won't be, for example, for fans of ~grinding~ pure and simple. The main feature that DQV introduced at the time, however, and which we find here in all its splendour, is the possibility that some monsters defeated in combat join the party, becoming in effect active characters, to be leveled up and equipped like the protagonists: up to four can be present at the same time in the party between main characters and monsters, another four trowill they be placed in the wagon that you carry with you from a certain point on, and the others? There is a ~breeder~ who will take care of them until you want to put them back in the group and develop their very personal characteristics a little more. Now, keep in mind that this game was released in 1992, and four years later the Pokmon phenomenon was born... The fact is that whoever applies himself carefully to monster management (which of course is not necessary for completion), will get dozens and dozens of additional hours, which together with the breadth of the world to explore, the numerous sub-quests and mini-games of the Casin di Fortuna, make The Bride of Destino one of the longest-running titles in the entire DS soft library. Fierce fighting So is there only good in the ~new~ Square Enix production? Obviously not, but in hindsight the sins are all venial, and in a certain sense, perhaps inevitable, linked as they are to the nature of the game on the one hand as a JRPG, on the other as a remake of an almost twenty-year-old title. We were talking, for example, about the difficulty of the fights, which, however, is no longer so if you have the patience, at certain times, to level up a bit and at the same time buy more suitable equipment, thus falling back into the usual clich of ~normal~ fights. little more than mere formalities, while only those with bosses really test the player's tactical sense and management skills. The frequency of random fights, then, is really very high, unnerving those who may have experienced only the current phase, certainly more ~mainstream~ than the origins. And, as a remake, DQ, alongside the impressive graphics and masterful sound that we have already talked about, lacks in the lack of management of practically all the peculiarities of the DS, apart from the use of the upper screen to expand the visible area with lots of management of three-dimensional graphics on both displays. Entrusting navigation through the menus to the stylus, for example, would have been an excellent thing, while in this way it is a bit cumbersome and slow; even the save system is not the most suitable for a portable game, and then, wanting to make a comparison with the contemporary remakes of the other RPG saga par excellence, the FMV films and the spoken dialogues of Final Fantasy III and IV are missing. As you have understood, these are all defects that are not at all substantial, which do not detract from an absolute masterpiece, which we can finally play properly even in Europe. With an absolutely delicious Italian translation: there are some things that the most vicious purists won't like, but, a, the slaying warrior who comes from Testaccio makes us laugh!
