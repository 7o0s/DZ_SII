{"name": "Edge Of Eternity", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/edge-of-eternity-recensione.html", "text": "If, as we did before writing the Edge of Eternity review, you open its Steam page and limit yourself to looking at the sketches, the trailer, the credits (among which appears the master Yasunori Mitsuda, composer of the soundtracks of Chrono Trigger , Final Fantasy XV, Xenoblade Chronicles), or simply stop to read the game file (whose title is a tribute, not too veiled, to Resonance Of Fate/End Of Eternity) in which it is cataloged as a Japanese role-playing game, you could hardly think that behind this project there is a tiny transalpine developer that we had already crossed paths with in 2017 with the action Hover. We've actually been dealing with this jRPG since its first appearance in Early Access on Steam, with a trial of Edge of Eternity dated December 2018, and then again a few months ago with a new trial of a more definitive version, but still rough compared to to that object of today's test. Spaceships and swords The universe in which Edge Of Eternity is set is a minestrone where science fiction mixes with traditional medieval fantasy: in an unspecified future, a nomadic and technically advanced alien species comes into contact with our planet. At first, coexistence is rosy, with extraterrestrials willing to share their technologies. One morning, however, they get up on the wrong side of the bed and start bombing humanity which, after being reduced to a minimum, manages to organize pockets of resistance and to rebalance the tide of war. However, the bad guys have the ultimate weapon in store: corrosion, a sort of virus capable of exterminating anyone unfortunate enough to get to know it. After a prologue of this tone one would expect to have to take up a laser rifle and take cover in some battered skyscraper: with amazement instead we get to know Daryon, the protagonist of the game, who, armed with a mega sword (which, in (s) proportions, mimics the Buster Sword) throws himself into the counterattack of a mech. We don't want to go too far into the narrative canvas: suffice it to say that it respects the typical clichs of the genre without adding anything particularly memorable, but it is appreciated in its lightness and, after a somewhat hiccuped start, takes a better rhythm. Under appearances Daryon and Selene, brothers united in defense of the earth Digging a little deeper we discover that, musical commentary aside, Edge Of Eternity is a game that betrays its European origins. Not only are the dialogues less ~verbose~ than those that usually entertain characters of Japanese origins, but also some of the topics covered are closer to the sensitivity of a Western audience. The plot unfolds through eight chapters, each characterized by a series of dedicated settings. The Final Fantasy saga, especially as regards the last few episodes, is the one that the guys from Midgar Games seem to have been most inspired by. During the exploration phases, the protagonist controls himself in the third person; his movements are followed by his comrades-in-arms, for a party that can count up to four units simultaneously. Between one village and another, real prairies are crossed, often connected by linear dungeons. The possibility of jumping and climbing is missing: an absence that translates into the linearity of the map, which therefore develops exclusively on the horizontal plane. To move more quickly from one point to another, you can rely on the nakaroo, giant cats with two tails that are exactly the feline equivalent of the chocobos; just like the latter they can be raised and have the ability to locate hidden treasures. The clashes do not happen randomly: the enemies who guard an area of the territory are clearly visible and, if desired, you can continue further without fighting. Their level is parameterized to that of the player, so it will never happen to come across areas presided over by monsters so powerful that they can only be faced at a later time. In the settlements there is almost always a hostel where you can sleep to recharge your energy (which, however, is consumed very slowly), a workbench for crafting (which we will discuss later), some quest givers and a bulletin board with announcements. Side quests are often flat and rarely differ from the simpler tasks that require you to kill a certain number of enemies for a reward. The game engine does not allow you to visit inside buildings; the designers have bypassed this limit by introducing, in some secondary areas, a sub-game created along the lines of the fights, in which you have to move the protagonists on a hexagonal grid toto unlock doors. Turn-based combat The numerous cut scenes are often afflicted by an annoying asynchrony between speech and lips Among the many souls of Edge Of Eternity, that of the fights represents the backbone, and it is probably the most successful aspect. The rounds take place according to the consolidated ATB scheme, with time freezing when it comes time to issue orders to party members, in order to leave the player the time necessary to select the most appropriate move. When starting a battle the view becomes isometric to provide a clearer idea of the battlefield, divided into hexes. Positioning is fundamental: only adjacent enemies can be hit with weapons, while spells can reach even those more distant. While casting a spell, the character remains at the mercy of attacks, so it is necessary to protect him to prevent the invocation from being interrupted; in the same way one can move if the occupied square is about to be hit by a magical attack. There are also some elements of the landscape that you can interact with: healing stones that regenerate health when you are close, or powerful crossbows that can be fired by anyone in proximity are just two examples of how the scenario can play a key role. There are also special attacks that must be discovered as the adventure continues. Initially the clashes are rather trivial, to become more articulated as the party increases in size and the health bar of the opponents more capacious. However, it would have been preferable to have larger battlefields (the small size slows down the tactical part) and to avoid that at the end of each fight the health and magical energy bars were automatically restored, making many clashes mere formalities. Experience The character growth system is decided independently by the game so the protagonist, Daryon, can only be a swordsman, while his sister Selene will get along well only with magic. The customization therefore concerns the weapons, which in turn acquire experience, and which can be enhanced with gems of various colors. The latter can be obtained as rewards for completed quests or for respecting certain fighting styles (kill the last marked enemy, never use the same attack, finish the battle in a certain number of moves). New weapons, as well as traps, can be created at the forge, provided you find the right ~recipes~ and have the raw materials, which can be collected from chests scattered around the world or from defeated enemies. Sadly, the crafting system is barren and you never really feel the need to access it. Even the equipment seems to be only sketchy: in the first hours of the game we managed to recover only a leather hood and a wrist guard, that is just two of the six objects with which the character can be dressed. Moreover, the clothes worn do not visually change the outfit. Technique The grid during turn-based combat is made up of classic hexagons For Edge of Eternity the programmers used the Unity engine, with all the well-known limitations that it carries historically with it. The character models are done decently, even if there is often a lack of synchronization between the speech (Italian is not even present in the subtitles) and the movement of the lips. The quality of heroes and villains is barely sufficient by today's standards and the characters that populate the cities are little more than immobile figurines. Instead, the creation of the game world is better which, although not exactly original, is still full of details and interesting views. The special effects of the spells are good, even if the wow effect that often distinguishes productions with higher budgets is clearly missing. On balance, the most successful technical aspect is precisely that relating to the soundtrack which, as initially written, is entrusted to a champion of the trade. However, the team deserves credit for continuing the finishing work: a few days after the release of the review, two big updates came out in rapid succession which, in addition to fixing some stability problems, also improved animations and other small aesthetic details. Longevity depends heavily on how many side missions you want to complete, and can reach the remarkable milestone of sixty hours, according to reports from the developers themselves.", "date": "2021-06-08", "grade": "6.0"}
