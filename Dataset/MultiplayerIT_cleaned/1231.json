The right back button is used to shoot, the left one to quickly switch weapons. If pressed for longer, it brings up the complete list of available weapons, in order to use secondary resources (grenades, gas mask, etc.). The d-pad is used as follows: UP to toggle the zoom of the equipped weapon, DOWN to change position (standing or crouching), LEFT and RIGHT to lean in both directions. The A button represents action for both your own character (when near an interactive object, such as a door or stairway) and the following party: if you press the button when viewing a door from a distance, for example , your companions will carry out an order to break through and clean up the room. But the orders to be given are different: take a look at the appropriate box. The head of Rainbow, John Clark, will explain in detail the objectives of each mission, and through various stages you will understand who cares so much about punishing Venezuela for oil supplies to the USA. Before leaving, you will be able to select equipment from a huge arsenal, the details of which are revealed during uploads. By the way, it's good to have something to read at that juncture, because the game has really long loading times Each level generally consists of two or three parts, in each of which you have to achieve certain goals. When you play a mission for the second time, the number of enemies does not change (at most their physical appearance - irrelevant), but their position can change depending on how you behave. Better to be silent and precise, therefore. The art of getting by Chavez's comrades usually have his back and follow him, but they can obey a wide range of orders when necessary. Pressing the A Button at an interactable object, at a distance, commands the party to do things like climb a ladder, defuse a bomb, or kick open a door and take out whoever is behind it. But to get the full picture of the situation, you have to hold down the A button: the others can simply dash into a room and shoot everything that moves, or break down the door first with an explosive charge, or still throw a flashbang before to hit terrorists (or ~tango~, as they call them). It is also possible to use the ~Zulu~ option, i.e. assign an order and have it go off when we decide to give rise, among other things, to simultaneous attacks from two sides (they enter from one door, you from another). We leave you with a special cartoon to explain everything in detail The technical aspect Even with a year on the back, Rainbow Six 3's graphics defend themselves well in every respect: the engine is very solid, practically free of uncertainties, and the polygonal models of the characters (good and bad) are quite detailed and convincing. The locations are also beautiful, with good textures and a generally spot-on design. As for the special effects, the light and shadow effects that you come across at the beginning of the game deserve a mention. The whole is filled with very well done interlude sequences. The sound sector is also of good quality: the music is excellent, truly ~cinematographic~. You will even find yourself flushing out terrorists in a large villa, to the tune of the Ave Maria The sound effects are realistic and do their job well, plus the speech is in Italian and is also well acted: we are faced with a localization of excellent workmanship, which perhaps would have earned a few more points just for the details that anyone who has read Clancy's novel should know. [C] It's Is it possible to order your companions to fly as well? Here is one of the very rare bugs in the game. There are so many bombs to defuse... Every now and then there are some barrels that are needed. possible to detonate. [/C] Comment Rainbow Six 3 is an excellent title, which GameCube owners shouldn't miss out on. It is a technically valid product, with a certain depth and quite engaging. Unfortunately, the NGC version of the game is the worst of those available, due to loading times but above all due to the lack of online multiplayer, replaced by a two-player mode with split screen. On balance, this difference can be a problem if you also own an Xbox or if you attach great importance to online, otherwise you can very well ignore it and jump headlong into the action. It's trueo: in this review we could immediately go to the gist of the speech, and list the strengths and weaknesses of the conversion of Rainbow Six 3 for Gamecube... But what's the point? Instead we will do as in Tom Clancy's books, going step by step and orchestrating a small twist (but small, we're not talking about Jeffery Deaver); first, however, it is a must to bore you with a detailed preamble. Just like Clancy does, my gosh. Rainbow Six was born as a novel, of course: a former CIA agent, John Clark, is tasked with setting up a group of special soldiers, the best ever, to deal with the increasingly frequent terrorist threats of the near future. Starting from England, Rainbow - this is the name of the team - leaps to the aid of governments that request it, soon becoming a point of reference. Rainbow Six 3, the game, sees you take on the role of Rainbow's team leader, Domingo Ding Chavez (Clark's son-in-law). In each mission, however, you can count on the support of three companions: Eddie Price, Dieter Weber and Louis Loiselle. If you have never tried a title of this series, consider that you are dealing with a rather realistic first person shooter (one shot in the right place and you can wave), with in addition various strategic elements, which are revealed in the possibility of enjoying the support of three other agents who, if necessary, do the dirty work for you or with you. At first, the presence of orders to be given to the team can intimidate novices, but the short tutorial is already enough to efficiently master all the commands of the game, moreover distributed in a very intelligent way on the GameCube controller.", "date": "2004-08-09", "grade": null}
