{"name": "Lost Planet: Trag Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lost-planet-trag-zero.html", "text": "It is undisputed that video games for mobile phones take on, in most cases, the function of chasing thoughts and/or limited pastime. However, this status of theirs has always deprived them of the dignity they very often possess, and the case of Lost Planet: Trag Zero is emblematic in this sense. Instead of developing a spin-off of no account starting from the original Lost Planet, in fact, Capcom has decided to produce a mobile game with its own why, in this case a prequel to the Xbox 360 title that puts us in the shoes of Gale, father of that Wayne who massacres Akrid on the Microsoft console in high definition, and whose ups and downs have so far only been hinted at. Under the orders of a technical staff, Gale must explore seven huge stages in search of key objects, not disdaining the clash with aliens. The game mechanic that underlies Lost Planet: Trag Zero is quite simple: within two-dimensional scenarios, if we want in Gauntlet style, we will have to find particular hot spots with our character while hordes of Akrid attack us without hesitation. The control system sees the movement assigned to the joystick of the mobile phone (or to the equivalent number keys 2, 4, 8 and 6), the FIRE key (or 5) used to open fire and the side keys (3, 7 and 9) which serve to view the objectives of the mission or use the extra weapons at our disposal. In this regard, it is always good to check the chests that we will find within the scenarios, because they often hide grenades, missile launchers and anything else that will make our lives easier during the fights. Fights that are regulated by the presence of automatic fire: once you press FIRE (or 5), the character starts shooting and does not stop until the enemies within range are eliminated, with automatic aiming and the possibility of moving as we want to get away from danger. What we will have to pay close attention to are Gale's two energy bars, one for health and one for temperature: when the second ends, the first begins to drop rapidly until game over. So we will have to remember to collect the substance that the Akrid leave on the ground after death, which will serve precisely to replenish the temperature bar. Let's not forget that the lost planet is anything but hospitable... On a technical level, the Capcom product is characterized by positive and negative elements. The sound consists solely of repetitive music, of good quality and with a certain atmosphere, but which we will soon find ourselves switching off. There are no sound effects, as is often the case. As far as graphics are concerned, the character unfortunately boasts very few animations and literally walks alternating between two frames (legs closed, game open), while the scenarios are very often composed of repetitive elements. It's much better with the aliens, especially with the ~bosses~, which come with a minimum of animation and not too essential design.
