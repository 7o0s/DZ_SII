{"name": "Micro Machines?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/135426-super-toy-cars-micro-machines.html", "text": "Let's face it clearly: just over fifty days after the release of Mario Kart 8, releasing a racing game on the eShop cannot be considered a happy choice. It must be said that the Eclipse Games title clumsily tries to build its own niche in which to be tinged with uniqueness, but the result reveals a long series of defects. After reading the team's intentions and now evaluating the effective application, the combination with the Micro Machines video game is immediate, thanks to which Codemasters made sparks fly back in 1991. Super Toy Cars takes more or less known gameplay elements and blends them in a cross between a work of nostalgia and a tribute to the most famous racing arcade sagas, forgetting, however, that the present requires very different standards. It is not so much the quantity on the plate that makes one turn up one's nose, nor the price at which it is offered; it is the infrastructure that combines physics and maneuverability that is most frustrating, due to a certain inexperience in calibrating all those gameplay elements - some even pleasant and spot on - included in the product and not sufficiently filed. Let's see which ones. Although at times appreciable, Super Toy Cars is not exactly the racing game that was expected Toy bugs With a points-based progression system, obtainable based on the results in the race, the campaign has an evergreen system of unlocking championships with incremental difficulty; in parallel runs a cash prize rail, which is necessary to complete the collection of all sixteen connected vehicles and upgrades. With eight championships, each consisting of six tracks, it would be natural to say that the focus of Super Toy Cars lies in the single player, yet looks can be deceiving. It will take less than an hour to get hold of the most competitive car in the game, with the result that from that moment everything becomes much easier, sometimes even too much. Although it is not a factor capable of altering the balance, weapons scattered here and there throughout the maps intervene to flavor each session with a certain arcade aftertaste. With a little dexterity and the right vehicle, the single-player mode will take no more than three hours to complete, with the stopwatch set to increase significantly if you want to enrich your garage with every car and related improvements. All this is not very galvanizing: for the end only a rather small backtracking is required, but fortunately in-game objectives intervene to support any lack of perfectionist self-esteem. Instead, we welcome the team's commitment to have included a rather complete and intuitive track editor via GamePad, provided that this mode does not send you the console in a state of absolute zero, blocking it irreparably and thus forcing you to disconnect the diet. There are far too many bugs that crash Wii U in Super Toy Cars, so don't worry if at a certain point in the race the image freezes and any input is superfluous: it's normal. It is a little less obvious that, at a playful level, the GamePad is a useless accessory, but in its own way: the Off-TV Play is in fact only half supported, with the video transmitted in real time on the screen portable, but forget HUD and audio. If your mother needs the television, you can then continue playing, but without knowing where you are or how much time is left until the end of the game; the team promised support soon, stay tuned. Where did I hit? With three cameras available, Super Toy Cars' gameplay response differs based on the camera chosen. There are two directions behind the vehicle (the distance varies) while the isometric eye is completely different, which diametrically changes the sensation of speed, controls, squeegees and driveability of the vehicle. The first two are less vintage but faster and more dynamic, the view from above is more tactical but less intoxicating. What they have in common is an ill-digestible physics: it doesn't matter which camera you're using, the feeling of heaviness of the machines is accentuated by a poorly structured edge cut, which will often block you in places where you were convinced you didn't hit and will frustrate editing sessions. game for sometimes unexplained collision errors. By competing in Super Toy Cars, you will make several jumps: it is a pity that the gravity of the leap does not respond to correct playability standards, with unreal impacts with the ground that will slow down the flow of the game too much, flattening the bite. As if that weren't enough, the automatic respawn transports you to the instant following the accident, but often it does it when it shouldn't: the cases in which, the car stopped for a set of reasons, the game forces the reappearance also against I fly itnty of the player, resulting in position losses and eliminations that would never have happened if we had been master of our own destiny and free to resume the race. Super Toy Cars offers five modes to keep the interest high: time race, race for the podium, race to checkpoints, time elimination race - every fifteen seconds the last vehicle says goodbye to the race - and elimination race with mines - same operation, but with random bombs that will immediately point out the maneuver inconsistency mentioned above. It is precisely this last invention that has the greatest potential, but the control defects undermine any pleasantness, consequently making it the worst of the lot. Between toys and jars The ideas that Eclipse Games has drawn from the past are especially evident in the design of the settings: puppets, tablecloths, plastic planes, forks and various types of fruit fill the maps, spreading a veil of lightness and playfulness that never tires. To aggravate a technical weight above the sufficiency for technical realization and polygonal mass intervenes an incredibly suffering graphics engine in most situations: the frame rate is often in a nosedive, with consequent phases in which the number of frames collapses even though we are not facing to a title that makes the flagship of the technical aspect. Fortunately, the offline multiplayer guarantees a good extension to the game offer: the possibility of racing on the tracks modeled with the editor adds a potentially infinite number of tracks, a pity there is no possibility either to share your creations or to search other players in the network. In perfect eShop tradition, forget an online meeting as expected: family and friends are invited to an old-school four-player split-screen at the same time, with full Wiimote support (inexplicably absent Nunchuck support), Pro Controller and GamePad. To delight your hearing, the team has enlisted an up-and-coming band to produce some catchy rock/crossover tunes, but the music tracks can be counted on the fingers of one hand...you'll get bored in the short term.", "date": "2014-07-30", "grade": "5.8"}
