In reality its origin is not only due to Sub Zero and company. Among the terrible dangers that dragged the poor souls of underage players towards eternal damnation there was also Night Trap, a game in which you had to protect beautiful high school girls from the attack of very bad vampires by monitoring the security cameras and triggering traps at the right moment . What interests us today, however, is not so much that Night Trap has been treated as a new Sodom, nor that among the protagonists there was Dana Plato who at the time disturbed the sleep of teenagers, but the fact that it was one of the first games to make intensive use of digitized footage. In fact, between the 80s and 90s the graphics were not absolutely comparable with today's ones therefore, thanks to the arrival of CD-ROMs, the top of the technology lay in the possibility of using clips of film mixed with interactive moments in which the player had to solve puzzles or decide what to do. This trend that was very popular at the time and started with the Dragon's Lair cartoons, passing through Phantasmagoria, 7th Guest and Gabriel Knight came to inspire today's Heavy Rain and Life is Strange. Over the years the use of movies has been lost, however apparently there are those who still believe in it: we are talking about the Canadians of Zandel Media and their Missing: An Interactive Thriller, which has recently landed on Steam thanks to the Greenlight program. An interactive thriller that tastes vaguely of retrogaming: will we be able to defeat those who want us dead? A rude awakening Sometimes it can happen that you wake up badly, but the real problems start when you do it in a place you don't know, hanging, with your wrists handcuffed to the ceiling and a photo of your family pasted on the wall with the words: ~Play with me~ underneath . These are the premises with which Missing: An Interactive Thriller welcomes us, which immediately confronts us with a series of questions: where are we? Who imprisoned us? Why is he mad at our family? And most importantly, how the heck do we make it out alive? To answer we will have to face puzzles that involve our deductive, logical and spatial abilities in more or less complex challenges, interspersed with filmed moments that tell us what happens. From time to time we will also have to use our reflexes to overcome some quick time events, pressing the right button at the right time to avoid an early game over. However, the story is not told only from the point of view of the poor man hanging by the wrists, but also through the eyes of the investigator who is looking for him to save his life and who obviously, given the vaguely noir tone of the story, has the vice of drinking. Click all! The best aspect of Missing: An Interactive Thriller are undoubtedly the cutscenes. The sets are essential but well done, without squalid scenarios in computer graphics. The actors are not dogs, on the contrary, some of the cast are full-blown professionals with many interesting roles behind them and even the hand that moves the camera manages to give a decent photograph. On the other hand, Zandel Media has as its main objective the dissemination of video games that mix the pleasure of video games with that of TV series, thanks to high quality videos, on all types of platforms (and in fact the game has already been released on mobile) , therefore the commitment and care in wanting to give the public something that surpasses at least the standards of the German detective stories that are occasionally seen on Rai is evident. To manage everything there is Simon Tremblay who cut his teeth in Ubisoft working on projects such as Splinter Cell, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed, to then decide to start his own business and found Zandel Media. After the first few minutes of trying to figure out how to solve the first puzzles, it is inevitable to get caught up in the story of Missing: An Interactive Thriller trying to discover every possible clue hidden in the environment around us and who will prove to be essential to move on to the next stage . In fact, the game has a strictly sequential structure in which each filmed segment anticipates a part in which we will have to explore the space around us with the mouse or by touching the screen to open lockers, move objects, collect clues or use what we have previously found. Since the interactive parts of the screen are not signaled (also because otherwise everything would be too easy) one inevitably ends up falling into the nervous tic of every graphic adventure: touching every possible area in search of something that works or an object to collect that give the light to go forwardthe. A taste that leaves the desire The puzzles in Missing: An Interactive Thriller are quite varied; some resemble an evolved version of the 15 game, in other cases we will have to analyze the environment to find the right password. In most cases, however, it will simply be a question of finding the right object to put in the right place. The quality of the puzzles is quite fluctuating and in general we managed to solve them all without too many problems; only in one situation did we have to rely on chance by clicking on the environment until a small door magically opened that contained the solution. Simple puzzles aside, the real problem with the game is its length. An average player will take about an hour to get to the end of this first episode which leaves many questions open about the continuation of the story. Among other things, we will have to wait until the end of 2015 to find out more since the production of the game is quite expensive. In summary, for around 4 euros we take home a trailer rather than a thriller and obviously, since it is a puzzle game, its replay value is zero. A real shame because the game is fun and made with attention to detail and we are sure that in the hands of a more funded studio it would have been a really interesting title capable of reviving a long forgotten genre. However, this has not prevented the game from achieving some success which is even making the developers consider the possibility of making a bundle purchase available for all the episodes, thus reducing the price for the individual chapters. If the package with the entire adventure were sold for around 10 euros, then it would be a must-buy for all lovers of interactive stories. For the moment, however, Missing: An Interactive Thriller can be right for you only if you are looking for a title that will make you spend an hour different from the usual; if, on the other hand, you want something that really makes your brain smoke, maybe it's better to fall back on the last pages of The Puzzle Week which, moreover, costs even less.", "date": "2015-08-18", "grade": null}
