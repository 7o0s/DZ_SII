A boulder aimed at the stomach of the players, a shot fired straight to the heart capable of making even the coldest souls cry. If we melted like icicles in the sun at the time, it was mainly thanks to Kan Gao, a person with a range of talents like very few others in the world of video games. Along with the undeniable ability to conceive and tell the story of To the Moon through this medium, Gao also demonstrated a perfect command of musical composition, signing a simply perfect soundtrack. With so many beautiful words spent in favor of To the Moon it was impossible not to think of a sequel, for which we had to wait six long years, however. In between, with A Bird Story we had a starter of what was to come, and it is three years after the latter that Finding Paradise finally makes its debut. A title eagerly awaited by all those who have had the opportunity to appreciate To the Moon, to the point of pushing Kan Gao himself a few days ago to put a video on YouTube in which he tried to dampen expectations. As far as we are concerned, we can anticipate that it could have done without a doubt, because Finding Paradise is the sequel that To the Moon deserved. Let's go see why. Should I play To the Moon and A Bird Story? Approaching this review, it is very likely that you have asked yourself the question that gives the title to this box. The answer is quite simple: before venturing further into reading, we strongly advise you to retrieve them both. Thanks to the discounts to celebrate the release of Finding Paradise, the expense to be faced to secure To the Moon and A Bird Story at the moment does not exceed 5 euros: practically the price of a beer to invest to be prepared for this appointment. You will grasp all the ties of Finding Paradise with its predecessors, but above all you will not risk having something anticipated by third parties. From the Moon to Heaven Apparently Finding Paradise does not contain direct links with To The Moon, sharing with the latter only the activities of Sigmund Corp. which form the background to the two stories written by Kan Gao. Just as it previously happened to Johnny and his desire to go to the moon, Finding Paradise puts us to grips with the last wish of Colin, a retired aircraft pilot who turned to the aforementioned company to change his memories. In fact, Sigmund Corp. has a technology capable of giving people a ~second chance~, entering their minds to graft Inception-style facts that didn't actually happen, but thanks to which they can grant a last minute free from regrets before of departure. The possible consequences of using this technology make it usable only at the point of death, when the company's doctors arrive at the customer's home with their equipment. Thus we find the old acquaintances Eva Rosalene and Neil Watts, professionals of Sigmund Corp. seen in the first chapter, now returned to satisfy Colin's desire. A job apparently similar to many others, but which soon begins to show its difficulties: Colin seems to have lived a happy life, with a job he loved as well as his family made up of his wife Sofia and son Asher. This is confirmed by the fact that Colin asks Sigmund Corp. not to change anything concerning his family, without appearing able to express what he really wants to get from the operation. Arrived at the place, Eva and Neil must therefore first find out how to satisfy Colin's desire for happiness, starting from the most recent memory up to his childhood. The experience won't prove to be as linear as Johnny's, putting a strain on the doctors' skills in getting their job done. Compared to the love story of To the Moon, Finding Paradise addresses philosophical issues such as the acceptance of adulthood, the confrontation with loneliness and the search for happiness in life, leading everyone to reflect on the ethical aspect of activity carried out by Sigmund Corp itself. Less direct topics, and for this reason perhaps able to make you cry less (even if we have already advised you to keep your handkerchiefs close at hand), but which in any case after finishing Finding Paradise will enter drop by drop into your mind, making you feel enriched by this adventure. We would really like to tell you more, but this is not the place: without further details what we can say is that Kan Gao has set up a different story from the previous one,but in absolute value just as touching. Chapeau. The strange couple The centrality of the plot also makes Finding Paradise an interactive story, rather than a video game, like its predecessor. The player can choose to control the protagonists via joypad, keyboard or mouse, with the latter choice preferred by us over the first two due to some inaccuracies in their management. On a general level, in addition to movement, there is a button to interact with the surrounding environment and another to access the game diary, containing noteworthy facts about Colin's history. As before, the story is told by going through the patient's memories, identifying in each scene an element (the so-called memento) that connects it with the next, together with some memories with a certain importance with which to unlock it. Everything is accomplished by wandering around the memory of the moment, interacting in an elementary way with the surrounding environment to collect the necessary data. The only puzzles that we find ourselves facing are those proposed during the activation phase of the memento, where we fit the various elements into a sort of Forza 4. While introducing new dynamics as the game progresses, these phases never present themselves particularly challenging, indeed allowing the player to hit the right combination even by clicking at random. These moments serve more than anything to break one phase from the next, entering with a straight leg even on particularly heavy situations from an emotional point of view. The mini-games inserted in one of the later stages of Finding Paradise do the same in the same way, in which you even find yourself in a fighting game and a boss fight as if it were a Japanese RPG. This is probably the way Kan Gao wanted to respond to those who complained about the almost total absence of gameplay in To the Moon, an aspect we still don't want to complain about even in the case of Finding Paradise. The plot and setting of this game are already able to hold up the scene perfectly by themselves, and the addition of any elements that do not concern them would only distract the player from them. The couple made up of Neil and Eva is more and more amusing: he continues to prove cynical and easy to joke, even if some of his actions lead the player to reflect on what is really behind these behaviors, while she always appears pragmatic in the exchanges that take place they consume almost continuously, drawing as in the past also from other works to lighten the emotional load a bit. Gao's art Despite being made with RPG Maker, Finding Paradise manages to be well detailed from a graphic point of view, testifying to a great effort also made in this aspect. Each scene is treated in detail, as well as the interactions of the various characters who manage to break down the wall of 16-bit pixel art to prove themselves excellently expressive, making faces and other animations that we didn't think could be reproduced with this technology. Some small slowdown undermines the fluidity of the game in some phases, but it is probably a sign that RPG Maker is squeezed to the maximum of its possibilities. Once again the soundtrack can be taken and commented individually as a work of the highest workmanship, thus confirming Kan Gao's skill in composition. Compared to To the Moon perhaps a particularly memorable song is missing, but we are sure that the scale played by Colin and the voice of Laura Shigihara will still be able to break through your hearts. Piano and cello accompany us for the entire duration of Finding Paradise, and it is fair to say that without their contribution the game would not be able to hit as well as it does. We point out the need for a good level of English to grasp all the nuances of the dialogues, or at least the presence of a vocabulary by one's side. Those who want to wait for the Italian translation should know that it is already under construction.", "date": "2017-12-19", "grade": "9.2"}
