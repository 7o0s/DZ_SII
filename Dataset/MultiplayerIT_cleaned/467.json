Textures and colors don't shine in any light, Spartan models and levels follow each other non-stop from the beginning to the end of the game. The monotony is broken here and there by some surprises represented by intermediate bosses and end-of-level bosses which instead show an antithetical design to that presented in the rest of the game. The voices, despite being the original ones, fail to recreate the atmosphere that one would expect from a brand of this caliber, while the music, although not particularly varied, still manages to partially recall the theme of the cinematographic counterpart. The register changes in the presence of the bosses who instead show a rather well-finished design despite the graphics engine being dated and decidedly poor on a structural level. The 360 version has almost nothing that could fall into the next-gen category beyond the higher definition and the application of blurs and various filters that can improve the glance. X-Men life Launched simultaneously with the release of the third film X-Men: The Official Game deviates from what was told on the big screen by narrating previous events that lead us to discover some background of the saga. In practical terms we find ourselves able to play the role of three of the most famous mutants with the aim of overcoming 28 missions populated by super-villains and entities that mix what has been seen in the cinema and what has been read in the comics of the modern vein of the X-Men signed by Chris Claremont. Despite the change in the narrative formula Voices and characters derive directly from Hollywood heroes and the models are derived from the actors themselves just as the Anglo-Saxon voices are those of the cast, including that of Xavier played by Patrick Stewart. The three subjects in question are the fierce Wolverine, the aletic Nightcrawler and the rebel Iceman. The relative peculiarities should be quite familiar even to non-fans of the series, despite this, I think a brief summary is due. Wolverine is a mutant capable of regenerating any type of wound, a power so extraordinary as to suggest to a military scientist the idea of being able to create the perfect soldier, practically immortal and equipped with adamantium claws and bones, obviously forced into living flesh . Instead, Nightcrawler comes from the east, an unbeatable acrobat and capable of making short and very rapid transitions in space in an ethereal form. To complete the trio we find Iceman whose name already says it all and indicates his ability to generate and manipulate ice in any desired form. My power is more beautiful than yours X-Men: The Official Game is a classic-style action game, a genre that punctually accompanies the videogame transpositions of action films. As anticipated we have the possibility to select three different characters each of which differs in combat and movement thanks to peculiar mutant powers. Unfortunately, despite the transition to three dimensions, the beat-em up hasn't made great strides forward and even in this case, at least as far as combat is concerned, there are no relevant surprises and the number of available moves is rather limited. Wolverine limits himself to chaining short rather repetitive combos and his superpower translates into fury mode, which is a mode that allows extremely rapid leaps and more powerful attacks. Nightcrawler, thanks to the ability to teleport short distances, offers a slightly more dynamic gameplay characterized by instant attacks and lightning-fast movements used to dodge and flank opponents, plus the ability to hide in the shadows adds a pinch of strategy to the action of game. Finally we have Iceman which represents the long range solution. Missiles and beams of ice allow you to keep enemies at a distance but, in case someone manages to arrive in close combat, it is also possible to erect an ice wall for emergency defense. three different characters each of which differs in combat and movement thanks to peculiar mutant powers My power is more beautiful than yours Put simply, the combat is rather limited and to this is added the lack of variety of enemies represented, for the vast majority, by anonymous guys in combat suits characterized by rather limited artificial intelligence. A positive point, from which Wolverine is excluded, emerges from the way we can go through the levels using Nightcrawler and Iceman. The former can jump and teleport from support to support, literally splashing through game environments, while the latter literally surfs on ice at aat quite high speed. After the long, easy and repetitive levels we find a second point of merit for X-Men: The Official Game and it is the final bosses, some of which are really impressive and centered on the use of the particular skills of the characters. To the advantage of fans of the series, the inevitable special contents and some missions of the Danger Room appear, an absolutely mythical place in the iconography of the X-Men. The return of superheroes made in the USA is an event that has involved the entire modern media landscape. It is a phenomenon that has literally characterized the beginning of the new millennium, passing from artistic revaluation to futuristic series, from cinema to television and even invading arthouse and non-artist trash and pulp. The clash of personalities between the thousands of superpersonalities who found themselves coexisting at the same time and above all having to fight face to face to establish themselves again in the hearts of today's young people, after having indelibly marked those of yesterday's young people, is inevitable. The winners of this fratricidal war are in no uncertain terms Spiderman and the XMen team who paradoxically are engaged in a real war between superheroes or rather super mutants. Of the two winning recipes, we are interested in the second which, between moralism and social reflection, touches not only the now rather banal theme of racial integration but also focuses, albeit Hollywood-like, on the thorny question of the legitimacy of the reaction, the real crux of the question. Oriental. Once the context has been framed, let's move on to talking about the element that distinguishes all reborn superheroes: the interactive transposition, the tie-in, in short, the video game. Comment X-Men: The Official Game is a rather poor product both in gameplay and in technical realization. Here and there it recovers thanks to some fights capable of breaking the monotony, but these are isolated moments and insufficient to revive the fate of the title. The same team, in the first game dedicated to the ~modern~ X-Men, had created a much better product. We are not given to know the causes of this drop in quality which affects a rather strong brand and rather full of ideas. Ultimately, thanks above all to the unlockable content, it is a title recommended only for fans of the series. Pros: some bosses show some care moving with Nightcrawler is quite fun Cons: almost non-existent artificial intelligence and challenge meager design", "date": "2006-06-08", "grade": null}
