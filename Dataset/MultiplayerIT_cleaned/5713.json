{"name": "Firewatch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/163351-firewatch-sperduti-in-un-bosco-interiore.html", "text": "There are stories that need dramatic deaths, epic moments, memorable jokes and sudden scares to leave you something; and then there are those stories that slowly creep into the folds of your brain, creating a small world in which to survive independently. Like hermits on a mountain, they create a space of their own in which to occupy your thoughts from time to time, without getting too noticed, but leaving traces here and there which over time are collected by the subconscious and reworked into thoughts that strike you completely. suddenly while you are admiring a panorama. It matters little that they are short stories; on the contrary, perhaps the fact of being able to appreciate them without breaks makes them even more interesting: they are not boundless panoramas that the eye cannot embrace, but a small picture in front of which to sit and let your thoughts wander freely. Firewatch had been in our sights for a long time, either because there are some former TellTale members behind it, or perhaps because the artistic direction has been entrusted to a character of the caliber of Olly Moss, but also because a software house called ~Campo Santo ~ cannot fail to arouse curiosity. Touching, beautiful, but not without flaws: here is Firewatch! The grove of my fantasy Firewatch is not a complex story or a boundless space to explore far and wide. Although at first glance we have the impression that we can move freely in the woods of Wyoming, here and there there are trunks that we cannot climb over and slopes that we cannot climb to remind us that everything moves on very specific tracks, that at sometimes they open up into larger spaces in which to move with a certain freedom. After the initial bewilderment and the continuous reliance on the map and compass, the space around us gradually becomes more familiar, even if the unfolding of the story will progressively open up new areas and new mysteries to solve. From a visual point of view, the spectacle that can be seen in the photos of this review does not do justice to the glimpses that you can admire while walking in the natural park, lulled by the wind and relaxed by the chirping of birds, as long as you are not afraid of the woods! Corners of paradise so beautiful that we will even be able to take photos, real photos that will be sent to us at home if we are willing to pay. Firewatch is undoubtedly a game worth using the best headphones and turning the volume up to the max. Accompanying us occasionally is a soundtrack that manages to perfectly frame the theme of the moment, be it sadness, relaxation or tension for something that is about to happen. Nothing in this game is left to chance, from the font of the forester's propaganda posters to the book covers, complete with a synopsis on the back, passing through the notes that Henry, our alter ego, will leave every time we come across something Interesting. A story for two There's a movie with Tom Hardy called Locke where all the action takes place inside the car, with the protagonist constantly talking to someone on the phone. A minimal setting that thanks to the incredible work of writing the dialogues still manages to keep you from giving up your chair. Apart from being able to explore the forest, Firewatch is something similar. A forty-year-old chooses to be a forester for a season, isolated from the world, having his only human connection through the airwaves. The main game mechanic is in fact linked to the walkie-talkie with which we will be able to contact our boss, Delilah, a woman with unknown features who should be more or less the same age. Every time we meet something we will be able to report to her, sometimes she will call us to have a chat and almost always we will be able to choose between multiple answers that will lead to as many crossroads in the conversation. Her voice will accompany us from the first moments of the game to the end, passing from the initial distrust to a real friendship that at the end of the game made us want to meet her for real, as if she were a real person. It is very difficult to try to explain the meaning of Firewatch without anticipating anything, but if we wanted to, we could say that it is the story of a man punched by life who seeks his place in the world in the woods and who will find himself faced with a great mystery that will lead him to the brink of paranoia. We really want to tell you more but it doesn't feel right, because Firewatch deserves to be enjoyed without knowing absolutely nothing. The only thing we can tell you is that, no, Firewatch is not a horror game and it won't scare you, even if in some moments it can be very, very creepy. Imperfect nature We would like to tell you that Firewatch is a perfect title and you should definitely buy it, but it's not. If you love ~walking games~, where you basically do nothing but walk, talk and interact with some object, where storytelling and emotions are at the center of everything, then you will probably love it. If, on the other hand, you are looking for action, strategy and challenge, this is not the game for you. You may also be disappointed by the duration because it takes about 4 hours to finish the game without problems and the replayability is decidedly low, given that regardless of our choices, the ending will not change, or so it seemed to us and an online tour seems to confirm it. Speaking of the Net, in these hours there is a lot of discussion about the ending: some are angry and disappointed by a conclusion that according to them does not live up to expectations and in some ways breaks the narrative pact with the player; others are enraptured by how the story concludes, despite the clues that start appearing halfway through the experience. Furthermore, despite the illusion of freedom, the game is firmly in the hands of the developers, who in some moments will break the pace to take it where they want. Even the passage of time is an illusion, as the sun will set when certain goals are achieved and not following a day/night cycle. Firewatch could therefore turn out to be a beautiful illusion, a Western city where the buildings are just a panel of wood and the music in the saloon comes from a hidden stereo. All of this is offered at a price that is perhaps a little too high for an undoubtedly interesting but short-lived experience. Far be it from us to put a price on art and fiction, but some may rightfully dislike it.", "date": "2016-02-11", "grade": "8.0"}
