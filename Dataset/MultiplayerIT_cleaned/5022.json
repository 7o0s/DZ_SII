To find an equally ambitious project by the Kyotese company, you have to go back in time almost two decades; some of you might mention Super Mario Galaxy but, apart from the fact that it was sculpted at the Tokyo headquarters (but this doesn't interest us), the plumber's interplanetary adventure, however experimental and extraordinary, represented fine excellence to itself. On the contrary, Breath of the Wild has taken charge not only of its own destiny, but of that of all EPD: the enormous times required for the development of a new engine, including an advanced physics engine, will be repaid by sharing these elements with other titles developed internally. To give you an example, the last major update in this sense dates back to the times of Super Mario Sunshine and Wind Waker, which however, taken individually, were certainly not as ambitious as Breath of the Wild. The last game to combine high ~personal~ and corporate goals was Ocarina of Time - or, if you prefer, Super Mario 64. If this weren't enough to make the context interesting enough, we remind you that The Legend of Zelda series , despite never having received negative evaluations, arrives at this crucial point after a series of chapters that have caused discussion: for the setting, for the realization, however distant they were by now from the essence of the series, from that exploration, from that difficulty and that sense of progression that had captivated millions of players. In a nutshell, to use a poker term, Nintendo has gone ~all-in~ with this title: the only possible move to preserve the sacredness of the saga, which has been progressively scratched in the last decade. Breath of the Wild is an exceptional experience that takes the series into the future with inspiration from the past Climb, burn and roll As soon as the adventure begins, there are two elements that immediately catch your attention: first of all, the absence of the execrable and talkative guided beginning that afflicted the last two episodes of the series. In Breath of the Wild, after a very short introductory movie, you immediately take control of Link (by the way, due to the dubbing this time you won't be able to rename him at will). The second striking aspect is the interaction, essentially composed of the varied and precise control system, the enormous freedom granted and the valid physics engine, three excellent qualities taken individually which, added together, give a truly surprising sensation. Link is one with this world, and the latter can be experienced in all its parts: there is no peak or hill that cannot be reached, there is no difference in height or rock that does not alter the movement of the character. In this area, and in this area only, Breath of the Wild is the authentic spiritual sequel to Super Mario 64: the freedom it gives is extraordinary. Each wall is scalable, and it is until Link runs out of his fatigue bar, which of course can be upgraded during the adventure. The attention to detail is obsessive, but we want to be clear: this is not a painstaking and claustrophobic compilation in the Skyward Sword style, but a precious care of individual elements which, rather than limiting them, expand the variables. Let us give you a practical example, first introducing another element, namely the changing meteorological and temporal conditions: 60 seconds in reality correspond to 60 minutes in the game, therefore a whole day lasts twenty-four minutes, and the weather conditions, excluding particular areas, they are always changing and random. We know that imagining all these qualities added together is not easy, for this reason we tell you an episode to make you understand how, combined together, they are able to originate something unique. A few days ago we were exploring a clearly rocky mountain area during a thunderstorm. The water flowed hard, and therefore Link was not able to climb as fast as usual: being the slippery surface, he often tended to lose his grip and return to the bottom. This being the case, to continue the journey we had to look for small winding paths that would allow us to continue our ascent despite the rain. After advancing a bit we reached a part of the land richer in trees, and at that point, to make the situation worse, lightning struck: the woods, notoriously, do not representThey are the safest place during a thunderstorm. We didn't have time to take cover: a bolt of lightning struck a shrub in front of us, the tree broke with the impact, and its trunk began to roll downwards following the slope of the ground. Having been electrocuted, it caught fire, and therefore caused a fire by colliding with the turf: luckily for us, however, everything was soon put down by the incessant water that fell from the sky. Well, this is just one episode. Breath of the Wild guarantees a variety of experience, and a quality in the variety, simply exceptional: none of us will play the same adventure, nor will we face the same dangers at the same time. Combat and equipment The biggest surprise of this The Legend of Zelda is certainly the level of difficulty: the demos prior to the release had prepared us for the type of experience it would offer, but they didn't let us imagine that it would be so difficult. Yes, you read that right: after years we have again a really challenging chapter in the saga, so arduous that not only Skyward Sword, but even Ocarina of Time is quite easy. The only equally difficult predecessor is precisely the progenitor to which it is openly inspired, or the first The Legend of Zelda. The rawness of the fights is mainly determined by two factors, namely by the character's equipment, which is often unsuitable for the situation, and by the strength (and number) of the enemies. The latter vary greatly in their approaches and behaviors, they tend to collaborate with each other based on the different degrees of intelligence, and above all - interesting news only for fans of the saga - they finally attack all together, not taking turns in the duel. The resulting situation of instability and precariousness generates ancient sensations, long dormant in The Legend of Zelda: some enemies can kill you with a single shot, others hunt you down and are faster than you, still others hunt in groups (beautiful in this meaning the reconstruction of wolf packs). In general, the balance between the two elements that we have listed before is fundamental: with adequate equipment you can approach otherwise unlikely fights, while with a poor inventory you risk succumbing even with a group of scarce enemies. Overall, a lot of people die, and sometimes the situation can border on frustration: exaggeration has been curbed by punishing deaths little, because Link always starts from nearby areas, and we assure you that you will be grateful for this choice. In this regard, automatic saves are frequent, and it is possible - with rare exceptions - to also implement them manually. Returning for a moment to the equipment, it is good to point out how the dreaded perishable weapons are necessary in terms of game design: they are the ones that push you to fight enemies - and risk your life - rather than avoid them, so you can then rob them, they are them to give dynamism to the action and to generate that constant sense of danger and need for survival. Not only starting weapons are broken, but also the most powerful ones. There are many tools to attack: swords, spears, hammers and more. Each of them is useful from the first approach, each requires a learning period to be fully understood, each has different pros and cons (the strongest tools tend not to involve the simultaneous use of the shield). The fights require a lot of attention and quick reflexes: the same clashes with the most significant enemies are no longer focused on the discovery of the weak point (not only, at least) but above all, and finally, on the action. By dodging blows at the right time, Link has the possibility of counterattacking in slow motion, which is useful but - fortunately - rare occurrence. The use of the bow as an offensive tool is more important than in the past, and it is extremely pleasant and dynamic to use (activated with ZR). Again, the various bows imply different approaches to the fights: some give greater power, others improve aiming (by enlarging the target). Link's equipment is made up not only of weapons, bows and shields, but also of other elements which, unlike the first three, are not perishable: shirts, cloaks and hoods, trousers and boots. It is essential never to be left with few tools: in addition to killing enemies, weapons and clothes can be obtained in shops, to be purchased with the canonical rupees, which however this time are not obtained by cutting the grass, but by selling the materials earned by killing monsters. The nature of Hyrule And here we are at the most important section of this work: the game world, the land of Hyrule. Let's start with the details: Link is not only able to run like in Skyward Sword - with motion dependent on the aforementioned fatigue bar - but also to jump. The jump, which has always been automatic in Link's three-dimensional adventures, serves to ~release~ the action button (which is no longer used to climb objects) and to reach certain elevated areas, but it still remains a secondary act in the game's economy: the demonstrates the fact that the height of the jump is not faded in relation to the intensity of the pressure. On the other hand, it turns out to be an important action if combined with the opening of the parasail, a tool that allows you to glide around the world (it also consumes the fatigue bar), which will give you a great feeling of freedom, especially if activated by the peak of a mountain. As usual, Link's vital energy is indicated by a series of hearts, but in this case, in addition to decreasing more often than usual, recharging them will not be immediate or simple. Just like the equipment of the character, even the food, which is used to restore health, requires time and preparation: in general, every journey and every destination in this game assumes a minimum weighting, throwing yourself into the fray is fun but usually unsuccessful and, indeed, counterproductive. You can eat berries, fruit, meat and fish, but the best is obtained by cooking and mixing the individual ingredients: in certain situations it is really essential to prepare well to face the next destination worthily. It is possible to hunt, of course: when an animal is killed, it immediately becomes edible meat, without suffering or suffering being shown. The representation of the fauna is in any case masterful, and perhaps constitutes the most valid decorative and intrinsically narrative element of Breath of the Wild: there are around ninety species of animals, and all of them are treated in their movements, attitudes and behaviours, by horses to wolves, from dogs to bulls, from foxes to squirrels, from deer to ibex. Exploration and progression So far we have told you about some of Breath of the Wild's excellence, as well as certain elements of break with the recent canons of the series, but there is nothing, really nothing, that distances this world from the previous ones as much as the exploration of Hyrule. Once you've finished the introduction, which lasts approximately four hours, you can go anywhere. The objective designated by the main mission is reported, but nobody forbids you to go elsewhere and, even if you decide to fulfill your task immediately, you will surely find yourself in situations that are inadequate for your equipment. The feeling of bewilderment and smallness is devastating: as soon as you leave the initial area you will feel weak and helpless, totally unprepared for what awaits you. And it is precisely this impression that is fundamental for understanding the progression in Breath of the Wild, because in fact it coincides with the increase in knowledge and understanding of a territory. Every region of this huge world, none excluded, has safer routes and other impervious ones: you have to learn to know them with experience, exploring and dying, running away and fighting. However, we would like you to understand how appreciable and anomalous this approach is: even in the presence of a radar (used, and in a generic way, only for the main quest) it is essential to study the surrounding environment, to understand how to achieve your goals. This gradual understanding of Hyrule, which repeats itself every time a new region is approached and which proceeds from the outside to the inside in a natural way, is perhaps the greatest merit - in terms of game design - of the game. You have to plan your trip, take precautions and equip yourself, but above all study, observe with Link's eyes and with your own what surrounds us: the non-player characters themselves, more numerous than expected, never give you a simple point to follow on the map (they don't give it to you at all, to be clear), but they give you descriptive information that respects the morphology of the world (such as, for example, ~cross the pass between those two mountains and then ask the man who lives on the hill on the left, he will be able to help you~... completely realistic indications, in short). You will find the inhabitants of Hyrule both around, in particular traders and adventurers, and in the villages, where you can be in peace - a more unique than rare case - and exchange a few words to undertake the side missions. The latter are numerous, and made even more complicated precisely by the absence of signals on the map, a facility to which the open worlds had by now accustomed us. A final consideration on the means of locomotion: the easiest and fastest is of course the teleportation, but it is accessible", "date": "2017-03-02", "grade": "9.7"}
