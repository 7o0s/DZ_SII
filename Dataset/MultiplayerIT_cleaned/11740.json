To deal with this second chapter, which follows in the footsteps of the previous A New Beginning, is the same Amaze team that developed the latest incarnation for Nintendo DS of another almost contemporary character of Spyro: Crash Bandicoot, with moderate results. In both cases, these are games born in the last decade, within a process of discovery of the potential offered by the ~new~ 3D visualization: sorts of adventure-platforms that have gradually been refined to offer gaming experiences rather original, so as to be able to generate series of a certain success. Over time, from videogame avant-gardes they have regressed in some cases to genres of secondary production, often suitable for a younger audience, or for the typical ~casual~ user. This introduction is necessary to place Spyro: The Eternal Night in the right position within the current gaming market, and to understand how it cannot be considered decidedly an example of a high-profile game. The developers have made a real return to the past, proposing the same dynamics that characterized the original episode of the series: a 3D game, which was largely justified in the simple possibility of exploring the surrounding environment at 360 degrees. The gameplay found its solution beyond the introduction of action and adventure elements rather than platform (the battle against Super Mario 64 was unthinkable on its own field). However, Spyro managed to carve out a place of honor in the industrious gaming market with a particular characterization and its own structure, which however is incomplete over time. A minor legend That Sierra Entertainment has big plans in mind for little Spyro is evident right from the choice made for the title: in this new incarnation, the series boasts the luxurious reputation of ~The Legend of Spyro~, to underline the idea of a true and own script built to support a trilogy of video games, such as a Hollywood production. In fact, the events of this Eternal Night continue directly from the conclusion of the previous episode, A New Beginning. The presentation traces the last stages of the final battle of the first chapter, with the arrival of a new, mysterious threat just when everything seemed resolved. In the period of relative calm following the clash, Spyro is tormented by dark visions and nightmares, omens of a new unknown and even more frightening danger that faces the magical world of the little dragon. In short, the canvas is typical of the genre: the protagonist is small but hides great power within himself, and he is the only one able to stop the bad guy and save the world. To do this, however, he will have to leave for the usual training journey that will lead him to awaken his true nature as a hero. The problem, on Nintendo DS, is finding the right way to tell the story, a question that has been resolved in a not exactly satisfactory way by Amaze: not being able to count on large multimedia means, the developers have eliminated the videos and animated cut scenes, replaced by static screens and very short fragments of text that only roughly describe the story being told. In this version, the high-sounding names of Elijah Wood and Gary Oldman, called to give epic depth to the adventures of little Spyro, cannot find space in the cartridge, as well as any attempt to create an engaging narrative. Ten years ago As we have said, the game structure of The Legend of Spyro: the Eternal Night is a real dive into the past, a return to the origins of the series, dated 1998. In some cases the ~back to the roots operation~ is a panacea for video games, when it is expertly done in order to give the original freshness of the title to a series that wearily moves towards retirement, as happened for Crash Bandicoot for Nintendo DS, by the same Amaze developers. In this case, the result is instead an exaltation of Spyro's original defects, dropped without too much harmony within a new look designed with little attention and care, it is quite evident how the two games have been followed with different dedication by the same development team. Eternal Night is a 3D action adventure, in which we guide Spyro in the exploration of the numerous three-dimensional environments that will follow each other in the story, where we will find enemies to defeat and variouspuzzles or riddles to solve. One thing that strikes you immediately, in terms of gameplay, is the lack of cohesion between the characteristic interface of Nintendo DS and the game structure. Spyro's movement and main actions are all performed through digital commands (directional cross and keys), leaving only a few particular tasks to the touch screen, such as the implementation of special attacks or the solution of some puzzles. However, the integration between the ~tactile~ phases and the normal game phases is missing, so much so that it seems that they have been inserted by force more due to the imposition of using the touch screen than for real reasoned planning at the level of game design . The keys to press are so small that they necessarily require the use of the stylus, which at times must be extracted, interrupting the game action in an almost annoying way. It is as if some touch screen elements had been suddenly inserted into a typical PSone platform-adventure, without trying to make them very consistent with the general structure. For the rest, Spyro remains suspended within a sort of indefinite limbo: it's not a pure platformer because the typical elements of the genre (jumps, platforms and total control over the character's movements) are scarce, and the protagonist's control remains wooden and anything but pleasant and fluid. On the other hand it is not exactly an adventure, since the puzzles are not so developed and frequent as to be able to base a characteristic gameplay on them. Ultimately it seems a sketchy mix of various genres, ranging from platform to fighting game up to adventure, poorly amalgamated with each other: you explore vast game areas, every now and then you collide with the enemies present in a way that winks at the beatem'up (but which annoys more than satisfies, due to the length each fight lasts) and objectives such as collecting objects or reaching certain scenario points are carried out. The rather dull level design does not help, for its part, to lift the game from the impending tedium. A fuzzy dragon As for the graphics of the game, one wonders if the transition to ~full~ 3D should be considered a real evolution for Spyro. Of course, the path may be the right one, but hopefully in better applications of the formula: it is, in fact, the first fully three-dimensional chapter of the series on Nintendo DS, close to the experience of the original chapter, the old ~Spyro the Dragon~ by Insomniac. We can direct the dragon in any direction within the scenario, with the ability to rotate the camera. The thing, in itself, is excellent, but it has been developed with a certain approximation: while the three-dimensional models of structures and characters are decent, composed of a not huge but functional number of polygons, the major problems are found in the management of the camera and depth of field of view. The first point often catches the eye, especially in areas that force the camera to make forced changes of shot, or in quick changes of direction implemented in confined spaces. In various moments, the shot fails to follow the movement of the protagonist, moving quickly back and forth with sudden zooms and sudden 180-degree reversals, creating a sense of bewilderment, or in general a continuous and annoying lack of fluidity in the action of game. Shallow depth of field is a problem that seems to come straight from the second half of the 90s. All the scenery beyond a few steps from Spyro's face is shrouded in a kind of thick purplish (or other color, depending on the color) mist. 'setting), which hides the vision. The problem becomes particularly marked in the excursus of the camera at the beginning of the various levels, when with a quick tracking shot the whole scheme is displayed, which appears completely enveloped by this particular form of digital weather agent. Spyro fans, however, will appreciate the faithfulness to the original characterization, the models of the main characters and the decent interior design. The audio sector (not) is instead distinguished by a certain widespread anonymity, with uninspired effects and tunes and in general in the norm. Comment The Legend of Spyro: the Eternal Night is in many ways an anonymous title, which hardly manages to stand out in the midst of the stormy sea of Nintendo DS games on the market. It offers a quick and intuitive approach to its dynamics, letting itself be played with serenity, but from a technical point of view it appears rather dated, and made with a certain hurry (the bugs present could easily have beenentities avoided with an appropriate testing period), while the gameplay is not remembered for any particularly original idea. In a nutshell, the game is not very fun, due to a now abused structure that has very little to say at the moment, and the technical realization certainly cannot save it from mediocrity, on the contrary. It can be said that at least there has been an attempt to move the series towards other horizons, passing from a 2D structure to a properly three-dimensional one, but the valid implementation is postponed, perhaps, to the third episode. It's hard to find compelling reasons to buy this game unless you've already finished the other worthy titles currently on the market or are a die-hard fan of Spyro.Pro: Return to original 3D structure play Cons: Stale and unrewarding gameplay Technical implementation with several flaws Poor touch screen integration", "date": "2007-12-13", "grade": null}
