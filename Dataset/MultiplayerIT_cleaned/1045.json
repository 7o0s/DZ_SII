{"name": "Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-kong-jungle-beat_a.html", "text": "Music between platforms On these pages we have often complained about the lack of originality of the games during the last few years, too inclined to choose proven and safe formulas rather than trying risky alternative paths. Nintendo thus decided to take a ~middle way~, with a truly atypical and intriguing experiment from the first announcements. In a nutshell, with Jungle Beat the programmers wanted to mix a platform game with rather classic main features with a rhythm game or rather, with its controller. Yes, because the latest production of the big N requires to be played through the aforementioned Donkey Konga bongos, taking advantage of an interaction that is both initially unsettling and exhilarating once you get the hang of it. And the genius of Jungle Beat is all here: to offer a game mechanic that is not at all original - at least in appearance - through a completely new approach. And the result is really exciting, so much fun and engaging like few other games out there. The control system, although quite simple, takes some time to master; in summary, tapping rapidly on a bongo makes Donkey Kong move in one direction, hitting both makes it jump, and the clap determines the attack. Basically, that's all. But when we talk about Nintendo, we talk about the art of stimulating the player by offering great depth even on the basis of the simplest gameplay imaginable. And of course Jungle Beat is no exception, taking you through a learning curve that is as sweet and soft as it is extensive and rewarding. In fact, the latest effort from the Kyoto house surprises above all for its double interpretation: it is not only the platform that goes to the rhythm game - via the controller -, but it is also the rhythm game that goes to the platform through the development of the mechanics of game. Let us explain better: in Jungle Beat the main objective is to collect as many bananas as possible, to obtain medals at the end of the levels in relation to the number of fruits collected. Bronze, silver, gold, platinum and so far nothing strange. But the collection of bananas goes far beyond the classic scheme that conventional platformers have accustomed us to know. In fact, although these are present scattered along the levels, or as a reward once the enemies have been eliminated, ~passing over them~ allows you to obtain only the minimum amount of them. Hence the concept of ~rhythm~ takes over, directly connected to that of combo; in practice, the game rewards the ability to switch from one action to another without making the ape touch the ground. Jumping on a bouncy mushroom, volleying an enemy, swinging on a vine and sliding down a rock slide and so on. Obviously the structure of the levels is perfectly made for this purpose, so as to allow in some cases to reach the end of the same with a single, endless combo. But all this for what purpose? But it is clear: collecting bananas during a combo allows you to obtain many more, in number proportional to the length of the combo reached. To make life at least partially easier for the players, and to make the undertaking less frustrating given the intrinsic lack of precision of the bongos in the most delicate passages, the programmers have decided to allow the ape to collect all the bananas in its immediate vicinity with a simple beat of hands. We realize that describing such a particular gameplay in words is extremely difficult, but we assure you that mastering this game system and starting to create increasingly chunky combos is among the most satisfying challenges we've ever experienced on Gamecube. The rhythm of the jungle To further fill an already very satisfying gaming experience, Nintendo wanted to insert the now retro ~end-of-level bosses~ at the end of each world - divided into 3 stages. It is a handful of enemies, even of considerable size, who cyclically return to visit Donkey Kong, obviously increasingly angry and always with a few more moves or strategies to raise the level of difficulty. Also on these occasions the goodness of the gameplay studied by the programmers is enhanced, both in the fun and in the variety that these ~meetings~ can offer, breaking the main scheme of the game very well. To give an example, the battle with the first boss is a real fist fight between monkeys, with the two bongos delegated to the left and right fists of the protagonist, and the applause for dodging. The next one is instead a huge wild boar, to be stunned first with explosive pineapples, and then to be punched by jumping on its belly. Exceptional. As for the technical aspector, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is an extremely valid title, as well as a worthy example of what the Nintendo console still has to offer even in its full maturity. The variety of settings is excellent, as is the level of detail offered; although in general the shot from afar can make you lose some of the touches of class of the graphics, the frequent zooms of the camera give the player the pleasure of being amazed in front of the petals of the flowers, the leaves of the trees, the expressions of the enemies, the realization of the fuzz of the protagonists and so on. All of course accompanied by impeccable fluidity and a rock-stable frame rate. The textures certainly deserve a mention, brilliant and defined enough to be taken as an example. The sound is also very good, both in terms of effects and as regards the music, capable of offering some truly valuable songs. A perfect platformer then? Almost. Because Jungle Beat is indeed a very fun and engaging experience but, unfortunately, also extremely short. Although it is necessary to obtain a large number of medals to unlock all levels, thus implying the possibility of repeating the stages on more than a few occasions, reaching the end of the game should not take more than a few days even if the game sessions are reduced to one hour. Which, in reality, turns out to be a necessity rather than a choice, since using bongos - as Donkey Konga players well know - causes pain in the hands and arms that is difficult to bear in the long run. Comment In a time of crisis for the platform game genre, it took Donkey Kong to put things right. Jungle Beat is, to all intents and purposes, one of the funniest games we've ever tried in recent months; the adoption of a control system through the bongos, simply unthinkable only some time ago, has proved to be an absolutely spot-on choice, capable of refreshing a largely extremely tested formula thanks to a completely original approach. But probably the most successful aspect is the game mechanics, as simple as they are intriguing and stimulating. Released quietly, Jungle Beat has therefore proved to be a brilliant game, which we feel we can recommend unreservedly to every owner of the Nintendo console. Pros: A completely new approach to the platform genre Simple but deep and challenging game mechanics Technically excellent from every point of view Cons: Disappointing longevity Inevitably painful on the hands A few more bosses would not have jarred Although Donkey Kong has always been one of the longest-lived and most loved characters of the great N, and although the games dedicated to the ape have always come out with a fair regularity, it is surprising to note how Nintendo has recently decided to exploit the image so extensively of the most famous primate in the world of video games. Remaining only in the original games and not talking about the recent conversions from Snes to GBA, we have witnessed the arrival of Mario vs. Donkey Kong and the recent King of Swing on the Nintendo laptop, together with the delirious and hilarious Donkey Konga on the cube that has dragged even those less inclined to this kind of production into the world of rhythm games. To conclude - momentarily - this overabundance of simian titles we wanted to think about Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, which also marks the return of the series to the genre of scrolling platformers.
