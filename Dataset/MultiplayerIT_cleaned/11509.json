{"name": "Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fire-emblem-radiant-dawn-recensione.html", "text": "The Fire Emblem To define, perhaps for the sake of simplicity, Fire Emblem as an Advance Wars with a fantasy flavor would be very simplistic, because the two sagas have very different aspects. The game scheme remains that of a turn-based strategy in which to command individual units on a battlefield divided into checkerboard sectors, but the similarities essentially stop there. FE is a JRPG in all respects, starting from the setting that plunders the Japanese fantasy imagery with its fantastic Western-like Middle Ages in anime sauce, to continue with much more substantial aspects such as the presence of a complex story and wonderfully well written, the characterization of each individual unit, which is a real character with its own history, motivations, attitude, characteristics and combat skills up to experience levels and relative increase of such characteristics and the presence of real classes, also to be evolved... On the other hand, even a comparison with a sacred monster of the S-JRPG such as Final Fantasy Tactics would be misleading: the flavor that FE leaves is much more that of a real own game of chess between the player and the computer, in which it is possible to have good results only after fully understanding the game system. Each move must be planned carefully, because the opponents are unforgiving and can take out your weakest units with a single blow; the game will continue to go on, but that character is definitively lost and it can be sad, as one willingly becomes attached to such well-characterized heroes. FE is therefore difficult, demanding, rigorous to the point of fussiness, a real hard core game and this is also seen in the planning phase before the clash, the ~Base~ available here from the fourth chapter, where you can not only buy weapons and objects as expected, but you will be able to manage things such as the more or less strong relationships between the various party members, which will then have their effects in combat. Fire Emblem is therefore difficult, demanding, rigorous to the point of fussiness, a real hard core game The Fire Emblem Facing a battle here means simultaneously taking into account a large number of circumstances, from the characteristics of the terrain to, precisely, the relationships between the characters, from the triangles of weapons and magic (Sword beats Ax that beats Spear that beats Sword, so to speak) , to the single characteristics of the single character for which, to understand each other, one of the basic tactics becomes to attract the opponent with a strong character in defense and then target him from afar with throwing weapons and/or magic, being very careful however to prevent archers and mages from entering the range of an enemy, because they generally have very low defensive values. A game of chess therefore, as we said, where the challenge does not lie in looking for imaginative solutions as can happen, within limits, for an Advance Wars, but in understanding how the game works down to the smallest details, in doing the best possible with resources at one's disposal, in constantly enhancing every single soldier and his unique peculiarities, in understanding, in short, how the programmers wanted every single map to be tackled. One example alone should suffice: one map, by the way one of the first, we had to retake numerous times because due to a stupid calculation error the enemies always managed to take out the weakest unit. Each new match took one step closer to victory, fixing this or that detail that we realized was wrong. Well, when it seemed that we finally figured out how to do it, our Thunder Mage was badly hit a few turns away from victory. We take advantage of the ~Rescue~ ability of the characters and entrust it to the protection of our very strong Thief, who easily ferries it towards the square from which it can be saved; only we forgot that after being dropped on a square by a teammate, a unit has to wait for the next turn to move. Result? When it is the opponent's turn, the enemy Commander arrives calmly and kills the Magician: forty minutes of game lost and the map to be repeated for the umpteenth time. This is what you will be faced with, a ~trial & error~ that can be frustrating but also incredibly exciting when, for example, you close a gap in the style of the Battle of Thermopylae and the correct placement of each unit allows you to resist one after the other. more to the assault of a dozen very powerful opponents! This is Fire Emblem, and this is, through and through, Radiant Dawn. Eighteen and (not)hear them? And here is the point: the description made so far could apply to any episode of the series, and in Radiant Dawn it is accentuated by two elements. First: it is the direct sequel to Path of Radiance on GameCube. Second: it's on a console that makes innovation its strong point. Being a direct sequel to the cubic episode first of all has consequences on the story: if in PoR we fought the Kingdom of Daein as the heroes of Ozna, invaded by their neighbors, here we will assume command of the Brigade of Light, a group of heroes from Daein who rebel against the Begnion Empire, which has come to the country to take advantage of its defeat. Sothe, one of the heroes of Radiant Dawn, is a veteran of Path of Radiance, and over the course of the game many characters from the previous title will join his cause. If you have GameCube episode saves, you can even use them on the Wii to have already advanced and strong fighters! The other consequences, however, are in terms of gameplay and technique. There is essentially nothing new to report in the game scheme, and already PoR is not adding who knows what big news; the thing is in fact understandable: Fire Emblem is such a particular and well-oiled mechanism, so complex that changing something important would mean distorting everything, and losing the support and passion of that hard core that the saga has built over the years. and to which RD is also dedicated. In short, those who already know what to expect do not have to read the reviews and will take the game with their eyes closed, sure to spend another dozens and dozens of hours (we easily reach fifty) in the company of their favorite challenge. the description made so far could apply to any episode of the series Eighteen years old and (not) hearing them? However, this takes on a different tone if we consider the second point, namely that we are on Wii: the remote control is not used in any way, pointing is not even possible, and it is no coincidence that, of the four available control methods, Wiimote horizontally and vertically, Classic Controller and Cube pad, this is the largely preferable one, if only for those who have already faced the challenges of PoR and have created a mental mapping of the control system. Not even online is considered and indeed, there has never been multiplayer in FE and this is not the occasion to introduce it, and finally from a graphic-sound point of view the game is exactly identical to its predecessor; not that settings and musical compositions are the same, they are new and have the same excellent quality, but technically they are facing the exact same engine not improved even one iota, and the same midi. The characters then, at least those who return, yes, they are exactly the same. A step forward, however, in the ~presentation~ sector: the story, as usual engaging and mature, set in a world characterized down to the smallest detail with the very particular and always present in Fire Emblem almost Tolkienian taste for political / ethnic issues, it is told here, in addition to the usual static screens without spoken dialogue but excellently drawn and some cut scenes with the game engine, by many more FMVs than in the previous episode. These FMVs are absolutely fantastic, epic, technically perfect and, even, dubbed in an excellent Italian that has nothing to envy for interpretation to the most famous anime that pass on TV! If the reviews are to be first and foremost a buying guide, then the math is easily done. Do you love Fire Emblem? Throw yourself into Radiant Dawn with your eyes closed. Here you will find, and at the highest levels, everything that makes this saga great. On the other hand, if, specularly, you have always hated it, pass quietly, because there is absolutely nothing that can make you change your mind. The problem arises if you are new to the series and intrigued: starting with RD would be exactly the same as starting with Path of Radiance or even, giving up the polygons and FMVs, with the GBA episodes, and this is the most serious flaw of the game. Who knows what Fire Emblem DS, announced some time ago, will bring usPro Fire Emblem in all respects, for gameplay and for story, setting and characters. Dubbed in excellent Italian!
