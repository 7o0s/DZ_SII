{"name": "F1 2002", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-2002_a.html", "text": "Toh! Schumacher won... First of all, a small but simple premise is needed. F1 2002 for Game Cube is not a real update but a pure and simple porting of the previous version that appeared on PS2 and this, unfortunately, is already starting to testify against it. If we leave out the updates related to the drivers' market and the addition of new entries such as Toyota and Renault, what appears to be the first Formula One game for Game Cube appears to have already been seen and archived on other consoles. The Options, in addition to the dutiful Championship that allows you to go through the entire season, offer the Challenge Mode, useful for metabolizing driving techniques through a series of trials and tests and a multiplayer that supports up to four players. The Championship mode, obviously more attractive, however, is enclosed in a cage of which it is up to you to find the key. To obtain the total freedom to manage options and move towards the more simulative components such as manual gearbox, damage and realistic physics up to the possibility of customizing the Grand Prix, it is necessary to complete the Challenge Modes. The system works in a similar way to the one made famous by Gran Turismo and its licenses. Driving tests to pass, short tracks to be completed in precarious conditions and anything else that allows you to earn the classic medals, from bronze to gold, thus providing for the meticulous unlocking operation in order to be able to fully enjoy the main mode. What, historically, is rarely missing in an EA title is the completeness in recreating the feeling of the sport in question. Also in this case, the qualifying days are excellently immersive. In the hour of practice, we witness the so-called challenge within the challenge, all the teams present on the circuit compete in an attempt to limit the tenths of a second, it is possible to cross them during the flying laps and then return to the pits and take stock of the situation, observing the tempos of others in progress. Activating all the items that lead to pure simulation offers very realistic situations ranging from compliance with the FIA rules currently in force (with penalties, yellow flags and so on) to visible and tangible damage. Breaking the axle shaft or losing a spoiler, of course, in addition to having a simply visual component, has a decisive influence on the driveability of the car. In these situations the pit stop comes into play which also offers a minimum of interaction through a sort of QTE, in which a certain speed of execution is necessary. If the landing on Game Cube seems to have given the gaming system greater fluidity and a more constant frame rate, it is undeniable that the overall view is not amazing. F1 2002 looks like the previous title on PS2 with its strengths and weaknesses. Even if many effects are still convincing (from the wet track, to the image distortion given by the heat, dirty tires, etc.), the feeling is that much more could have been done than a mere porting which, between not exciting textures and an already old system does not offer a real novelty. The sound sector keeps faith with the approach of the entire title, or rather a sort of ~without infamy and without praise~ which, if it does not allow for a decisive criticism, in any case leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, given the awareness of how many improvements could have been made. Comment However, F1 2002 remains the first (and for now only) Formula One title available for the Game Cube. A product far from excellent but still able to give fun to true motoring enthusiasts (who can also add a hypothetical extra point on the overall rating). A certain persistence is required to extract the best from this EA game. The fact of not having tried to put together something really ~new~ and dedicated to the Nintendo console but having relied on a port of an already not too acclaimed version cannot avoid a small condemnation. A greater effort would certainly have made it more probable that a product like this could also be used by the general public who do not identify body and soul with F1 drivers. Sin. Pros: Gratifying and fairly simulative Good longevity Graphically pleasing Cons: low quality textures and frame rate dancer devoid of real innovations only for F1 enthusiasts In a season that has brought the Game Cube software park (especially for those who rely on Import) to very high quality standards, the box dedicated to Racing Games continues to languish in a death of inadequate titles that is all too little highlighted. Eletronics Arts F1 2002 should haveor arrive in time to plug the open wound while waiting for those games intended to fill the gap. Will the richest and most discussed incarnation of the automotive scene also open the right path on GC? The initial doubts appear, frankly, more than legitimate.", "date": "2002-12-12", "grade": null}
