To realize it are the English of Rodeo Games, who make the leap in quality by dedicating themselves to a famous license after the two episodes of Hunters, a turn-based strategy game whose structure is in this case ~exchanged~, replacing futuristic mercenaries armed with rifles with warriors , dwarves, wizards and elves who wield heavy warhammers, magical swords, double axes and mystical staves. Those who have already had the opportunity to appreciate the work of this development team will therefore have no problem dealing with a rather simple and intuitive touch control system, which allows us to move and / or attack with our units during a turn and then give up the initiative to the enemy troops; all within numerous quests (we are talking about over twenty hours of gameplay) that are gradually unlocked on the map, while our team moves from one village to another in search of adventures, and which take place in the dark of dungeons full of hostile and powerful creatures: from giant spiders to bats, from mice to ogres, passing through huge trolls and even more cunning and powerful opponents. The Merry Brigade The four characters initially available to us in Warhammer Quest are a raider, a dwarf, an elf and a gray wizard. As per tradition, each of them can only equip objects designed for the class they belong to, and in each city visited a rich market allows you to buy precisely this kind of weapons or armor, as well as sell what you no longer need. At this juncture, unfortunately, we do not notice particular steps forward compared to what Rodeo Games did with Hunters, indeed we run into the same problems: when buying a weapon it is not possible to contextually view our equipment to understand whether what we are about to take is a more effective tool than what we have. The interesting expedient of tilting the iPhone vertically to manage objects directly, therefore, leaves some time and fails to improve an important aspect of the experience. Another valuable element of this production, but equally ~problematic~, is represented by the narrative component. Referring to the very nature of Warhammer, the stories on which the various quests are based are very pleasant to read, but the choice of a microscopic font honestly makes this operation difficult. To this we must also add some youthful technical problems, such as the game freezing while loading an enemy incursion or the loss of recent progress following the closure of the application. Nothing an update can't fix, and we're sure it will, but the initial impression isn't the best. Luckily, there's a lot to be happy about: the already mentioned volume of the campaign; the presence of numerous objects including weapons, armor, potions, rings and scrolls; a non-original game system (it is practically the same as Hunters) but effective and full of strategic depth; a technical sector which, within the limits of the view from above (which does not help at all in terms of spectacularity, on the contrary), knows how to assert itself. Aside from a few edges, Warhammer Quest undoubtedly stands as a must for fans of the franchise", "date": "2013-06-06", "grade": "8.0"}
