{"name": "Deep Space Nine - The Fallen", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/deep-space-nine-the-fallen.html", "text": "Where the box is the spaceship and the baldheads are the Star Trek captains. In fact, there is a tacit assent to the fact that a good mercenary captain is bald. The wise Picard teaches, the half-prophet Sisko (among the protagonists of this game) repeats the idea of the Frenchman... and the others? For the uninitiated, there is a rumor that the ~Gascon~ J.T. Kirk was equipped with a nice patch and I'll add that sooner or later they'll even shave Voyager's Janeway, or make her hair fall out for a scare... Jokes aside Deep Space Nine - The Fallen is nothing but a game which draws liberally from the Deep Space Nine (or DS9) series, daughter of the mother Star Trek, and does it in an excellent way. Anyone lucky enough to follow the TV series (given that mother RAI, holder of television rights, treats it a bit of a filler) will be pleased to find most of the cast in digital version, from the aforementioned Sisko, to the most fetid drunkard in the bar. Ds9 is in fact a space station, not a typical StarTrek spaceship, and for the occasion it has been rebuilt properly, both externally and in the rooms ... I must say that the programmers really worked hard to recreate the feeling from ~last outpost~ that reigns inside the station. Not infrequently, therefore, you will walk around meeting Klingons, Cardassians, Ferengi at Quark's bar... and turn towards Dr. Bashir's infirmary, or Garak's tailor shop. Clapperboard is played We are facing a third-person action game, divided into missions to complete, full of a good plot like the latest Trekkian productions, in which you will play a fundamental role. At the basis of the plot of Ds9 there is the necessary discovery and protection of three mythological crystals of Bajor, which if they fell into the wrong hands would allow the owner to obtain unimaginable power. The Cardassians naturally want the crystals to break free from the Dominion, but can they really be trusted? In the role of one of the three characters made available in the game, your task will be to defend the ~treasure~ from the invaders at any cost, engaging yourselves on the front line. In fact, you will be able to play with the aforementioned Captain Sisko, Major Kira Nerys, a woman who distinguished herself in the past as a Bajoran fighter during the rebellion against Cardassia and finally the legendary Worf that we all know by now as a proud fighter of Klingon race who decided to live in the service of Starfleet. Depending on the chosen character you will have different and extremely different missions to face, which helps to triple (x3) in fact the longevity of the title in question. Let's say they will also reflect the role of your character. In principle it can be said that Worf will be the most combative and there will be no shortage of clashes, Sisko will cover missions of high responsibility as well as skin salvation, Kira is more ~sneak~ and makes agility and sneaking 2 basic rules . Now excuse me, I'm taking a break to rest my hand... uff! People ready for anything In addition to being tremendous nerds (otherwise Starfleet won't get you) we said that our fearless ones are also people of action. And equipped with weapons. We will have the opportunity to arm ourselves with all the conventional equipment of the fleet, including the famous phaser (and for dear Worf, his Bat'leth, the Klingon double-bladed weapon) Each weapon provides for an alternative fire, in the case of the phaser precisely we can adjust the intensity of the beam itself. In addition, among the various junk I point out the fundamental tricorder. Well yes, finally we will be able to probe, plumb, analyze walls, living beings...everything! Just like in the TV series, the tricorder is vital and once extracted it will give us a summary analysis of the environment around us. Understand for yourself how it can be useful to detect, for example, hostile alien life forms behind a thick steel wall, so as not to be caught unprepared. Or find the medicine chest or control systems and equipment in a particularly dark area. You will use it often, believe me... Another little object of desire, I would say better than the cell phone, is the communicator... you know when they touch their chests to call someone else? Here's the one there ... it will be fun and useful to call some of the colleagues in the middle of the mission to exchange information, request help, etc. Generally, the flashing symbol appears when it's time to use it, but nothing prevents you from calling someone when it suits you best. Thanks to these few expedients, and to the good number of ~NPCs~ (non-playing characters, a term borrowed from RPGs) situations and missions will reserve various surprises and many dynamic changes of objectives. Report to the captain deep Space Nine - The Fallen is another pleasant surprise, and rises from the average of games dedicated to one of the most famous TV series in the world. This bodes well for the videogame future of the saga. Let's say that I place this game just behind the undisputed prince of trek titles that responds to the name of Elite Force... but here we are faced with two different titles. EF is a first person shooter with a good story. DS9 The Fallen is an action 3rd person with an equally varied and intricate plot, supported by the possibility of ~maneuvering~ 3 of the main characters of the series, with all the joy of yours truly and whoever will play it. Charisma at 1000. If you are a Star Trek fan, you absolutely must not miss it and keep a nice Epiphany stocking that can contain the box. If you are not an avid supporter of the series, but you like the futuristic setting, encounters with alien races, unforeseen events, etc. well ... what to say, try it and you will not be disappointed ... He takes his hands, but with criterion. It ~goes on~ but faces a well-crafted story. Sincerely, my best regards and I start preparing the ice pack to put on my hand. Quick hand doesn't stop I open with a reflection: can a soccer match be bad for your health? The answer is yes, above all when an opponent-sympathy undecided whether to dribble me or not finally opts to suddenly shoot a ball in the middle of the area, not caring that between his sweet foot and the goal of the shot there was my person, in this case my left hand, in detail my holy thumb. How can we fail to thank him for this tender sprain, for this beautiful rigid bandage that I will wear for five days (New Year's Eve included), for the hours spent in the emergency room... bah! Now there are two cases, if you take pity and think that consoling me with a nice e-mail (photos of provocative and/or scantily dressed sisters are welcome) you know the address, otherwise if your next 5-10 minutes involve reading the review of Deep Space Nine - The Fallen, you are welcome below...", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
