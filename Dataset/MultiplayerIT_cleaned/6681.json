{"name": "L'oscurit dal DLC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/142261-destiny-loscurita-dal-profondo-loscurita-dal-dlc.html", "text": "We gave Destiny, here on Multiplayer.it, 8.7 when it came out in September amid the controversy of those who said it was too much, due to the scarce content, and even those who said it was too little for other MMOs (whether they were more or less RPG ) had enjoyed greater tolerance for throwing shortcomings, especially in light of wonderful shooter mechanics. Had we to reckon now, we'd feel like giving even more after spending more hours with Bungie's new work than with any FPS of the last five years, with a degree of frequency that we can only remember for Halo 3. But this doesn't make us forget of the problems of the game, which are undoubtedly those of the contents to be reviewed, but also those of a too random loot system and the lack of matchmaking for the raids, which is not there by choice, but which is not counterbalanced by a clan management that allows you to organize real online activities. In short, faced with a game that has something that many others don't have and that forces you to return to the network every day, the publication of The Darkness from the Deep is the first and most important opportunity to understand what Bungie has in store for the his creature who, if he really has to live for ten years, needs continuous and effective care. Eris arrives Some time ago we interviewed the president of Bungie who told us that one of the strengths of the first DLC would be the story and the narrative experiments related to it. These, in essence, take the form of a new character, Eris the only guardian who survived the fight with Crota, a real divinity adored by the Hive, one of the four alien races to fight. This new character appears as a vendor in the Tower and gives the player a series of missions, missions that require the completion of certain bounties (the Destiny sidequests) to be addressed. In practice, instead of three new chapters to run through, Bungie decides to pace the pace by forcing the player to take a series of intermediate steps that help contextualize the story, which remains rather smoky and largely linked to the information on the cards in the library that however, they can only be read on the Destiny website. The idea is interesting, as are the missions (a fourth is added with the collaboration of Xur, the merchant who appears on the Tower at weekends), but which remain rather short and largely located in areas of the maps in which players have been roaming far and wide for months. The feeling of deja vu also extends to the enemies, which are, except for the reskin of some bosses, the same as in the base game. In about two hours (you can see it from At Lunch With below), we finished the new story-related part on the first attempt by playing it on difficulty level 30 and we reached the end of the new Assault. For PlayStation users there is also an exclusive one but which consists in going backwards through the last level of the basic campaign by turning at a crossroads to find yourself in front of an energy portal behind which we have wondered for months what could be there: two rooms and one encounter with the weaker Vault of Glass final bosses and a moss covered version of the hydra to be defeated at the end of one of the older Strikes, the Nexus. Speaking of the Vault of Glass, the previous raid to be played by six players simultaneously, there is another to close the PvE package that takes the player into the depths of the Moon to defeat Crota, the god of the hive on the verge of awakening and invade the cosmos, and also for the expansion it proves to be the pinnacle of Bungie production with mechanics never seen before by FPS that force you to alternate small adventure intuitions with platform phases, hand-to-hand combat and the usual copious and very intense gunplay, which holds strongly glued to the pad. This review was written six days after the release of the DLC and immediately after completing the new raid with the usual adrenaline rush and wandering through a series of inspired and unusual maps that however do not represent the quality of the content general of L'Oscurit dal Profondo, which remains lower than the one proposed in September. The new activities are lifeblood for those who have been playing Destiny for months, but the level design, while still of a good level, is less complete than previously done, with levels that ask the player for less tactical commitment and analysis of the settings, since for the most part it's about going and destroying what's in front of you just being careful to clean the areas before entering them. We also feel like making an annotation. Each week the player is offered an assault to do as a heroic and as a Calathe Night, which is the most difficult content available in the game, which becomes exciting also thanks to the excellent artificial intelligence of the enemies. However, every day there is a chapter of the story that must be tackled on a Heroic level. These three activities are the only ones that allow you to quickly obtain some of the items needed to upgrade weapons and armor and when the chosen Assault or level comes from the expansion, players who have not yet bought it are left with no possibility of doing them, limiting in fact the content available. Of course, with a DLC there is exclusive content that those who don't buy should expect not to be able to play, but there is no good reason why those who bought the game in September can't continue with the old levels in some activities that are in the process of playing. basis of the experience offered by Destiny and it would have been reasonable to expect a choice between old and new assaults and missions so as not to displease anyone. To close the package there are also three new multiplayer maps, these can be tackled in a separate playlist, but which do not add much to the offer, also given that they can only be played in deathmatch modes, remaining inexplicably excluded Control (at least until December 23rd ). The first, long-awaited DLC for Destiny: The Dark Below is finally here! New economy The most important passage marked by The Darkness from the Deep is the raising of the level cap for the characters to 32 which must be reached as before by finding or buying pieces of armor with enough light inside to go up. Where previously the limit was 30 light particles, it's now 36 per piece of equipment. So you need three legendary items found in the new raid and at least one exotic item. The good thing is that anyone, even players who haven't bought the expansion, can reach at least 31 simply by buying as much as they need from vendors. Eris brings with it a whole new series of Daily Bounties linked to the new contents and lunar setting of the expansion and, above all, sells the new ascendant materials necessary to upgrade the armor found during the End of Crota, the new raid. These materials can only be found there and therefore getting to 32 will be a long and demanding thing since, as always, the loot can only be obtained once a week. Furthermore, waiting for a decidedly urgent patch, the previous and beautiful incursion, the Vault of Glass, becomes substantially useless because it releases ascending materials that are unusable for the new weapons/armor and above all because the statistics of the pieces that can be found have not been updated, which therefore they are, except for one weapon, all weaker than those that anyone can buy by simply going to the Tower and spending a handful of Vanguard and Crucible marks, which are what you get between PvE and PvP every week. Weapons also undergo a performance boost, reaching a maximum attack limit that goes from 300 to 331. The new weapons can be bought or found above all by playing the new assault playlist (the difficulty level goes from 24 to 26) or in PvP, while for the old ones, for which whole days of farming were spent to enhance them, you have to wait for the notorious Xur to offer the possibility to reset them and bring them to the new level over the weekend, forcing the player to reactivate all the perks redoing the same activities as always, given that the new contents are limited, as mentioned, to three story chapters and an assault (two, if you play the PlayStation version). This, however, if we talk about Exotic weapons and armor, the rarest and most powerful. All legendary weapons and armor cannot be recovered and must be repurchased or found again by playing, nullifying what has been done so far. Again, it is quite normal that in an MMO with a new expansion the old equipment becomes obsolete and that you have to buy the new package to continue, but here we are talking not only about the new weapons included in the expansion, but all the old ones which must be obtained by redoing the same activities as before and in the same areas because the new ones are not sufficient either to find them or to give all the objects necessary to enhance them. The Darkness from the Deep offers moderate quality content, confirming the exceptional nature of the raids and an artistic and technical style that transmit, depending on what you are doing, exaltation, fear, fun or even just simple time to chat with friends like in the most classic of MMOs, combined however with shooter mechanics that have few comparisons on the market. More courage is needed, however, the resolution of some problems that Destiny has been carrying around since September and the releaseio of more continuous content and not only linked to the new paid expansions because the 20 required are not few unless you have taken the season pass which those who are continuing to play will have already done or will not be able not to do why give up the experience offered by Bungie is damn hard. The writer has played and will continue to play Destiny daily for the next few weeks, but to get to the ten years envisaged for the project, if not for the publication of the next DLC, a course correction is needed.", "date": "2014-12-15", "grade": null}
