Alongside the classics, revisited or proposed in the original, completely new games are finally beginning to appear, created ad hoc for the new laptop. Certainly inventing a new brand and a new character, although it is always a gamble, is decidedly easier when the chosen development platform is still at the dawn of its life cycle; this is why the birth of the grumpy cowboy Dillon, protagonist of Dillon's Rolling Western, appears to be a welcome but certainly not unexpected novelty. Curious, perhaps, may instead seem the animal race chosen to interpret this (not very) likeable hero: none other than a humanoid armadillo. Rolling West A ~xenartrous~ mammal, i.e. devoid of any teeth: this is the very brief but rather exhaustive description that would fit perfectly, in the ~real~ world, at the shy and nocturnal armadillo; in reality Dillon is represented in Dillon's Rolling Western as a guardian, a surly anti-hero who, once his duty is done, can't wait to remove the curtains, without, among other things, literally saying a word. His smart young assistant, the marmot Scott, takes care of speaking for him, who also takes care of the guardian's business and tasks, advising him in his choices especially at the beginning of the game. The close-knit couple Dillon and Scott, crossing all the villages of the game world represented in Western style, have the task of defending them from the attack of some dangerous and voracious stone monsters. These creatures, which emerge from underground lairs, are greedy for the precious Mangiolini, farm animals similar to white pigs but even plumper; it seems that in the world in which the adventure is set, the little eaters represent the main if not the only means of sustenance for the villagers, which is why if they were stolen or worse eaten it would be the end for everyone. The mayors of the villages therefore hire Dillon to manage their defenses from monsters and to physically destroy them; the game is therefore structured in different activities, even if quite related to each other. The first phase essentially consists in an exploration of the territory, in search of various resources: first of all the seeds of mangiolie, which are used to raise new mangiolini, but then stones, minerals, precious gems, to be found inside the mines scattered randomly in the game map. When the sky begins to turn red, it's a sign that the monsters are preparing to attack: at that point it's good to run towards the village to deliver the resources, buying and selling upgrades. In this phase, if in possession of the necessary minerals, it is possible to proceed with a fortification of the village gates, ideal for slowing down the attacks of the stone creatures. Once the ~management~ phase, so to speak, is over, it's time to face the real action: in fact, with the sky completely red-purple, the attack begins. Although waves of tower defense-style enemies arrive, the approach chosen to take them down is much more active: armed with a stylus and left analog stick (the 3DS must be held in one hand, precisely the left, with the stylus on the right ), the player's task will be to charge a rolling attack of the dangerous armadillo, as if there were a spring on the touch screen of the console. To do this, just drag the nib down and release it suddenly; Dillon will begin to roll and thanks to the analog lever it will be possible to direct him towards the desired point. Rhythmic and energetic touches then help to keep the loading speed high; once you reach a monster it will split into several parts and, entering combat mode, it will be up to us to destroy them all. The guardian's attacks are essentially linked to his furious rolling: by loading the tension of the ~virtual spring~ (ie the stylus on the display), it is possible to inflict increasingly stronger damage; moreover, with the continuation of the adventure, Dillon will acquire new powers and upgrades, such as sharp spikes on the armor or the ability to hit enemies with his own claws. The 3D effect Excellently done, the 3D effect in Dillon's Rolling Western is pleasant and absolutely advisable during the less hectic phases of the game, to enjoy the depth of the landscape. Once in the middle of the fight however, due to the natural movements due to the uncomfortable grip that one is forced to assume, it is betterI may reduce it to a minimum or reset it, in order to avoid the inevitable problems of displacement from the ideal visual axis. And the towers? Not even in Dillon's Rolling Western could you do without defense towers: along the route of the stone giants, in fact, it is possible to erect defensive turrets, using the money obtained as a reward from the previous working days. Strategically positioned, the towers can in fact give concrete help in defending the village, but they cost too many resources: in fact, there is a price to erect them (in wood of course, given the tariffs for those reinforced in iron!), another to equip them with weapons and possibly even extras to repair them if attacked directly. Nonetheless, in the more advanced levels their presence is really fundamental if you want to overcome an enemy wave unscathed, together with the fortified gates and an acceptable number of eaters; this is because the level of general difficulty grows exponentially, making the fateful seven shirts sweat in some situations. All this also results in a potentially infinite or almost infinite longevity, if we consider the challenge of freeing each village by obtaining the highest possible rating, i.e. the three stars. Each Dillon mission lasts three days; at the end of each day you can save your progress and manage any small subquests, linked to particular requests from the villagers. Technically speaking, the game is enjoyable thanks to a good characterization of the characters (who speak through comics) but above all thanks to an inspired and chromatically interesting setting, full of saturated colors that distinguish the dusty places of the old west. Dillon's animations are well done, especially the rolling ones and the frame rate is stable. Too bad for the inevitable repetitiveness of the actions: except for a few little surprises, which break the monotony of the exploratory phase (in fact we have come across animated mangiolia seeds and sudden stone thieves for example), many of the actions to be performed will have to be repeated indefinitely, with the inevitable dose of boredom that this implies.", "date": "2012-03-01", "grade": "7.2"}
