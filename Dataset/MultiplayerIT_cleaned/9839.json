Japanese RPGs, by definition, do not belong to this type and are not worthy of being called such if they do not offer dozens of hours of gameplay, complex fights and a story that unfolds along hundreds of dialogues. There are also some good examples for the iPhone, including portings of historical titles such as the first two Final Fatasy -which indeed do not last long by current standards- and some unpublished experiments such as the excellent Chaos Rings, which from our point of view is balanced perfectly in terms of length and replayability in relation to a portable device. Crimson Gem Saga adheres to the most rigorous canons of Japanese role-playing games, has a duration that can easily reach over 30 hours, turn-based combat with enemies visible on the screen, predominant dialogues and a type of setting that recalls some cornerstones of the genre such as Star Ocean and Secret of Mana, especially for the colors and the style used. In reality, even in this case we are not dealing with an unpublished title, but with a port that comes from PSP, where it was released with the same name last year. Be a true knight The title, developed by IronNos Software and published by SK Telecom, features a certain Killian von Rohcoff as the protagonist, a knight who has just graduated from the military academy who dreams of being able to join the army, but who soon finds himself involved in a series of events that will lead him to travel the world in search of mysterious gems with strange powers and to cross paths with various characters such as Spinel, a thief and treasure seeker by profession. The story of Crimson Gem Saga unfolds in a rather interesting way and already from the first hours there are several twists that strengthen the narrative, which seems to start according to the classic clichs of the genre but which instead follows a much less obvious path than as it may seem at first. It is also well told, with dialogues that are not lacking in humor and that have been adapted to perfection, unfortunately (for those who don't know the Albion language) only in English. The game scheme provides on the one hand the exploration of the city, with the dialogues between characters, the shops where to buy weapons and objects, the taverns where to rest and regain energy; on the other, the dungeons and settings that act as a link for exploration. As mentioned, the fights are turn-based: at the top right is the attack order of all the characters while the enemies, before being ~engaged~ are visible on the screen. From this point of view, the phase preceding the fight is very important, because it is vital in the game economy to physically hook the enemies before being discovered, in such a way as to start the fight with an initial bonus attack from all your companions team, giving a nice advantage. Likewise, if the opponent ~sees~ Killian on the game map before he can touch him, an exclamation mark will appear over his head. At this point you have a couple of seconds to lock onto him, otherwise the enemy will start with an initial additional attack. The last eventuality is to be avoided as much as possible, because the difficulty level of Crimson Gem Saga is set upwards and you need to carefully plan when to use any spells or special abilities (which consume mana points) or support items. There is also the possibility of chaining attacks between some characters when they are consecutive and of infusing their weapons with elemental magic, to exploit the enemy's weaknesses. Negative statuses such as poison, the inability to summon spells and more are of particular importance, which must be exploited but on the other hand avoided as much as possible in order not to increase the difficulty of the clashes. In fact, the game does not forgive: you have to save manually often and in the event that all four team members die, it is instant game over, with the game returning to the main menu. There is a problem, however, and it's not a laughing matter, given that Crimson Gem Saga does not save automatically and at present does not support any type of multitasking. On the iPhone, if you receive a call while playing, the result will be a restart at the end of the same with the loss of unsaved data, which is absolutely regrettable. Hopefully this is a defect intended to be corrected by future updates, but in the current state of things the situation is this. Going back to this problem di programming, even the Crimson Gem Saga interface certainly doesn't shine for intuitiveness and realization: moving through the dense menus typical of an rpg requires too many steps, scrolling through a tiny list of objects requires precision and the touch-sensitive areas are often not very intuitive. A pity, of course you get used to it over the hours, but there is a feeling that the developer could have done a lot more in this regard. Also because the game for the rest is packaged very well also from a graphic point of view, with a delightful realization of characters and cities, reduced loading and in general a pleasant impact, supported by a combat system that is obvious in the long run but pleasant and, as mentioned above, from a very valid narrative structure.
