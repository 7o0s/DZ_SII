On the other hand, it is thanks to the two-screen laptop that we owe the fact that the company knew and was able to keep the bar straight during the dark Wii U period, when dense and gloomy clouds gathered above it. However, console obsolescence is an inescapable fact, which in the case of the 3DS has pushed even further a system, already in itself often associated with a young audience, towards a niche of pre-adolescent players. On the other hand, except for special cases and nostalgic fans, who can really use a 3DS in 2019? Children, mostly. Or at least those who are ~saved~ by the exclusive use of smartphones and tablets, perhaps by choice of some parent-gamer who appreciates the robustness of the Nintendo handheld, the reduced price and the very rich catalog of titles. Hence, Kirby and the New Hero's Cloth becomes the perfect product for this type of audience: a simple but not simplistic, accessible and delightful adventure that comes straight from the glorious era of the Wii. A world hanging by a thread In fact, 8 years have passed since the release of Kirby and the Hero's Cloth, at the beginning of 2011, in one of the happiest periods in Nintendo's recent history. However, it is more than probable, for the personal reasons described above, that for most of the potential players of this 3DS version, the adventure of the plump pink hero is completely new. The choice of the Kyoto home obviously fits into the desire to give life to the laptop through reduced investments: in this case the choice appears completely spot on, because Kirby and the New Hero's Cloth is very comfortable in this ~second home~. Sure, the lower screen does little or nothing, but that's not necessarily a problem, nor has it been in other cases. For the rest, the hardware of our New 3DS XL managed to digest threads, buttons, patches and various fabrics without problems. Yes because, as the name suggests, this chapter of the Kirby series is one of the exponents of the ever-widening category of ~material~ games developed by Good-Feel, which from here has subsequently expanded with Yoshi's Woolly World and the upcoming Yoshi's Crafted World. The plot is a small fairy tale, and sees Kirby transported to Toppalandia, a world made entirely of threads and fabrics; there he meets Prince Batuffolo and decides to help him defeat the evil wizard Malandrana and restore the kingdom to its original splendour. No longer having the plump texture of the past, Kirby cannot vacuum up enemies and absorb their powers; for this reason he can now count on a kind of red thread whip, through which he is able to hit enemies and interact with the environment. This last element is a fundamental component in the development of level design, since it is precisely through the manipulation of the backdrops that the material element takes on greater consistency: the hero can therefore lay out fabrics, unravel skeins, unthread threads and pull zips, thus giving an additional thickness to the graphic element that goes beyond the pure aesthetic aspect. To guarantee variety to the otherwise linear progression of a rather standard 2D platformer we think the transformations, or rather the pre-established sections in which the eclectic Kirby can transform himself into different means such as a tank, a fire truck, a train or a dune buggy, to thus address gameplay variations purposely built around the capabilities of the specific form assumed. New content If the title is to suggest anything, it is clear that ~New~ Hero Cloth has a certain meaning. Indeed, this 3DS version is not a simple direct port of the Wii original, but tries to add some ingredients to the initial recipe in an attempt to make it more appetizing. First of all, 6 hats have been introduced, which Kirby can recover during the levels and which allow him to obtain additional skills and powers, such as wielding a sword, or throwing a bomb or becoming a vortex. Although interesting at first, the hats rather quickly reveal their nature as a false addition, which does not mix well with the balance of the original formula, giving the player an excessive, further advantage. Then there is the Demonic Mode, which in practice has as its main feature the presence of a small but annoying demon who tries to hinder the hero by throwing thorny balls at him. Also, Kirby himself has a limited amount of energy in this case, which forces you to restart the level after taking 5 hits. It is an interesting variant, albeit a little repetitive in its execution, which increases a challenge rate practically non-existent in the normal mode, and which therefore appears particularly appreciable for those who need an additional stimulus or for those who want to find a way to face the adventure a second time. Much less incisive are the two extra mini-games included in the package, entitled ~Fila, Dedede, fila!~ (a timed challenge) and ~Meta Knight chopper~ (more focused on combat): rather negligible variations of the main formula, which can take a few minutes but are unlikely to capture anyone's attention. On the other hand, we are sorry for the elimination of the two-player multiplayer, which on the Wii had been able to be appreciated, finding perfect sense in terms of sharing the adventure with a companion who may have little or no video game expert. Completely absent, in a largely obvious way, the 3D mode.", "date": "2019-03-18", "grade": "8.5"}
