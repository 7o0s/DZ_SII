This saga full of action, breathtaking views and mystery has in fact represented one of the highest points of ~cinematic~ gaming, and the already remarkable capabilities of the house have developed together with it, reaching unthinkable peaks for the hardware to which it belongs. Of course, as remarkable as the team's mastery from a technical and narrative point of view, many players consider such skill almost wasted, as they are eager to get their hands on their own title entirely focused on gameplay. However you look at it, however, a Naughty Dog project always makes your mouth water and even Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, their latest addition, has unleashed us cravings that we didn't think we could perceive for a simple expansion. However, the Lost Legacy is not a trivial DLC: it is a stand-alone chapter, with new protagonists, and a new duration comparable to that of a main Uncharted. Here's what we discovered, wandering in its pristine lands A strange couple of real tough Since Uncharted 4 was the conclusion of the story of Nathan Drake, The Lost Legacy boasts a new protagonist: Chloe Frazer, an old acquaintance of fans of the series. However, Nadine Ross is accompanying her on the adventure, an unexpected choice that allowed Naughty Dog to create interesting dynamics in the back and forth of the atypical female duo. The story of the game is in fact based on the search for the mysterious Fang of Ganesh, a magnificent artifact of inestimable value that the two heroines apparently seek for the sole purpose of making money, but in reality the narrative is largely structured around their relationship. which starts with a certain coldness and develops quite naturally during the campaign. Much of the narrative quality also derives from the remarkable actor tests of Claudia Black (the voice actress of Chloe) and the rest of the company in the pay of the team, at times able to give the production a value comparable to that of a high quality film ; the technical sector instead does its duty with excellent facial animations as usual, the perfect icing on the cake of a title with a great rhythm, excellent dialogues and moments of the highest level. For heaven's sake, we are certainly not dealing with a particularly memorable plot: the skeleton of the story is weak and banal, and the main antagonist is stereotyped and predictable; yet the feeling is always that of being in front of a spectacularized and modernized version of Indiana Jones, which keeps the player attached to the screen despite the senselessness of certain moments. On the other hand, what the acting, technical sector and writing fail to do in this case is the gameplay, very close to that of the predecessor but not without interesting gimmicks. Pristine lands The basic mechanics are always the ones we are used to, let this be crystal clear: The Lost Legacy is always a third-person shooter with a cover system and very marked adventure elements, including the possibility of climbing certain walls and the presence of puzzles of various kinds. Shaun Escayg, the new director, has however decided to focus on experimentation, taking his work in a slightly different direction from that of Uncharted 4. After all, after the first and very linear phases, you will find yourself in front of an Indian map to travel on a off-road vehicle that recalls that of its predecessor in Madagascar, but is much more free, extensive and enjoyable. Don't be fooled... freedom is largely illusory: while fully explorable, this area is actually more like a beautiful diorama with linear stages well thrown into the mix than a sandbox map. Put simply, The Lost Legacy is a chapter in the series that allows you to deal with its individual parts in no particular order, not a structural revolution. The incredible thing is that these parts boast a care and variety that has nothing to envy to the primary games: in search of the mysteries of the Hoysala empire (created for the occasion, of course), Chloe and Nadine will have to deal with a large number of puzzles, well-built platforming moments around the climbing mechanics, and battles, all within a multifaceted and cunningly crafted mix. There was no time to overturn the systems, yet the team still tried to improve the pillars of the brand by inserting a greater number of destructible surfaces (roofs, yes, but also walls designed tohiding secret rooms), a new lock picking mechanic (pretty basic, indeed), and even tweaking the artificial intelligence. The ~new~ then mixes with quite marked references to some of the most memorable moments of the previous chapters, for a final result that cannot fail to be satisfactory for a fan of Nathan Drake and company. Surrounded by splendor But let's go back to AI for a moment, because the use of Nadine has led Naughty Dog to get their hands on the behavior patterns of allies in a sensitive way. Chloe's partner is an expert and aggressive fighter, who often during the game will eliminate part of the enemies completely alone and help you in stalemate situations: it is evident how the developers have therefore perfected the allied routines, even if they have not yet managed to eliminate the tendency of the companions to walk in front of the enemies resulting ~invisible~ which has remained since The Last of Us. Not bad: in every other aspect the artificial intelligence is of great quality, and the pathing of the enemies remains one of the most unpredictable and complex ever seen. The Lost Legacy was also created as a sort of direct sequel to Uncharted 4, and as such its clashes take place in maps that are generally more complex and full of enemies than normal, for a level of challenge that is generally more than worthy. All the goodness described above, however, disappears in front of the technical majesty of the game. We don't know what they feed Naughty Dog's graphics and artists, but it must be very good stuff, because The Lost Legacy is a technical masterpiece from the first minute, and reaches peaks that on PlayStation 4 are hard to match conceive. Perhaps aware of this, the developers have included specific areas where Chloe stops to photograph the landscape during the game, the typical Photo Mode, and a series of unlockable filters which - in addition to further demonstrating the now monstrous technical awareness of the studio - sometimes they manage to give even more charm to certain landscapes. The imaginary setting allowed the artists to indulge themselves to levels never seen before, all with the usual scary attention to detail to which we are now accustomed. To keep the action fluid and some mechanics coherent, there are forcings in the animations at times (you will notice a shift of the bodies in the right position in more than one situation), but we are talking about little things that disappear in the face of a technically stunning title. We close with the longevity, which as we said at the beginning is close to that of a primary chapter of the series: we are talking about eight hours of play, which can drop significantly if you decide to neglect the secondary objectives of the open map, even if we do not see why you would want to.", "date": "2017-08-17", "grade": "9.0"}
