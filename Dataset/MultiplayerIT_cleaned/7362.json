It was a real success, both with the public and with critics, and it is surprising that the team took over four years to make the long-awaited sequel, available on the App Store with a free downloadable version that includes some levels, but which can be updated at any time. complete edition via an in-app purchase of 4.49 euros. The numbers of the offer already say many things: one hundred and twenty stages, each of which can be tackled according to three different levels of difficulty (which substantially modify the track, adding additional obstacles), seven cars equipped with specific characteristics, four game modes, an editor that allows create and share your own circuits and a global ranking that compares our performance with that of friends or complete strangers. In short, the experience of Jet Car Stunts 2 has been designed to offer hours and hours of entertainment, both for longtime fans and for users who are approaching this series for the first time. In fact, a few minutes are enough to enter the spirit of the True Axis title, which alternates traditional dynamics with real flight sessions, with the cars not only racing on the asphalt but also ~jumping~ from one platform to another. another using powerful thrusters that must be ~dosed~ so as not to run out of thrust before reaching the objective of the turn. Jet Car Stunts 2 proposes the excellent formula of the first episode, supported by respectable numbers Fly, oh oh The four modes we mentioned above include the standard race, in which whoever crosses the finish line first wins, the checkpoint race, the time attack and a challenge based exclusively on stunts, in which we are asked to indulge ourselves at the inside a sort of huge skate park and get a certain minimum score to pass the test. Situations that alternate cyclically within the huge countryside, where we will have to deal with vehicles that are very different from each other in terms of speed, acceleration, handling and flight capabilities. The key to success consists in adapting immediately to the news, correcting the shot in the running so as not to lose precious moments or incur penalties with respect to the final result. Fortunately we will be able to count on an excellent quality tilt control system, capable of reconciling even those who tend to prefer touch screen input for reasons of convenience. In fact, it is enough to tilt the device very slightly for our car to receive the command, acting with the fingers on the screen to control the accelerator, the conventional brake, the air brake and the engine. We also found the implementation of the track editor very interesting, which takes an approach that is a bit problematic at first. In fact, we need to draw the track simply by driving and letting our car create the asphalt under its wheels, between a hairpin bend and a loop of the loop, activating or deactivating the ~brush~ if necessary. The system is assisted by a technical sector that lives up to expectations, which focuses on flat surfaces - while taking care of the choice of colors - also to ensure great fluidity on non-latest generation terminals. Of course, on the gameplay front, the solutions adopted often herald a high degree of challenge and there are episodes of frustration, but at the same time the satisfaction is great after completing a race that seemed really impossible at first.", "date": "2014-01-15", "grade": "8.2"}
