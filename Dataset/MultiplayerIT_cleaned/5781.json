{"name": "Un colpo vincente?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/161945-pro-basketball-manager-2016-un-colpo-vincente.html", "text": "Let's go back to playing the role of a basketball coach in the new chapter of a series that fills a gap, that of management software dedicated to basketball, quite important given the number of enthusiasts who follow the events of the most famous five-a-side sport in the world. The history books tell us that basketball was born from the mind of Canadian James Naismith, a professor at the Springfield YMCA charged with finding a discipline to practice indoors to replace gymnastics during the winter months. But the roots of this sport go far beyond the mere need for a discipline made up of sprints and elevations. We find similar rules in the Duck on a Rock game, which is said to have been the primary source of inspiration for Naismith, and looking back we find even more similarities in sports practiced by the great pre-Columbian civilizations even if it seems that the ball was often a human skull. Fortunately, today we play with a rubber ball and in this case we don't even need that, since our game is played from the sidelines. Cyanide is once again taking care of the new incarnation of the series, in collaboration with the guys from Umix, and this time we are undoubtedly starting from a more solid base since there is no trace of the bugs that accompanied the launch of the previous chapter. With this premise, the Cyanide series faces an important appointment, considering that the last chapter has already shown undoubted potential but has proved unable to fully hit the target. Let's start by saying that everything seems to still be good. As in the last chapter, the title provides the player with everything necessary between articulated statistics, rumors, financial management, drawbacks, injuries, individual and team training seasoned with statistics of freshness and happiness, which force us to pay attention carefully to the micro management since a disgruntled player plays badly and a tired one can get injured more easily. The calendar is located at the top right and by clicking on a specific date it is possible to simulate all the days that separate us from a given appointment. While waiting for the matches, the days pass one by one between national team calls, training sessions, rumors, accounts and the simulation of a ton of championships, including some for women, structured by rules related to those of real events. In all of this, thousands of athletes evolve, change teams and get injured, altering the general picture and our chances of signing a successful player. To do this without spending a fortune it is necessary to go through scouts who are paid a lot, constituting an important expense for the team, but can be sent to a specific country and can be guided with a large number of parameters in order to find the player who we need it at any given time. As in the last incarnation it is also possible to decide, and this time in a decidedly simpler way thanks to the two full database and light database options, whether to simulate everything or reduce the number of competitions calculated in order to shorten the waiting time during the calculation of that what happens in one day. Cyanide is back under the basket with Pro Basketball Manager 2016 Willingness to win The roster can be established at any time, but before a game it is of course possible to adjust the lineup and assign players to additional roles such as defense, sixth man or go-to-guy who takes on the responsibility of scoring the decisive points. In this phase there is the automatic assistant who tries to give us a hand by assigning the main roles based on the statistics but by clicking on them a few times consecutively it is clear that in some cases the virtual assistant has a bit confused ideas and this means, predictably, that only the player can formulate the most effective formation. Statistics count a lot in determining the outcome of the matches but it is not enough to create a team of champions and find the tactics that best suit the characteristics of the team. Having talented players is very important, but so is changing tactics and making substitutions throughout a match taking into account performance, type of game, fatigue and mood. The title allows us to do this, just as it allows us to change roles, to assign a specific marker to an opponent, to suggest to the team not to skimp on defensive fouls, to change the defensive tactics and to decide the offensive one complete with a slider for indicate the desired ball play and the distance of the shots. Furthermore, next to the name of the players, four boxes stand out which allow us to communicate to our players whether we want to or not cwho make three-pointers, two-pointers, under the basket and penetrations. Furthermore, we can also decide to influence a single action, assigning one of the aforementioned options on the fly to a player and finally we can encourage the team with the classic motivational phrase which has the more effect the more it adapts to the situation. Despite the complexity of managing from the sidelines, Pro Basketball Manager obviously allows us to simulate matches, avoiding the risk of a heart attack. And the micro-management with the ball stopped is so rich as to include a scheme editor that enhances the player's role and further increases the complexity of the Cyanide managerial, but which is by no means easy to handle. For this we thank the developers who have armored some schemes leaving us safe loopholes in case our ego exceeds our competence. Matter of feeling Once we have established that statistics and choices have a tangible effect on the outcome of the games, we can move on to the interface which plays a fundamental role in a title of this genre. The screens are very similar to those of the previous chapter but are more readable and have been enriched with graphics and other elements that make everything more pleasant despite the fact that the menus are not the most intuitive around. From this point of view, however, a step forward has been made and it is really a shame not to be able to say the same about the visual representation of the matches. As in many managerial games we can observe the matches in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional key, and it is here that we encounter the first real sore point of the Cyanide production. The three-dimensional view offers us models from other times who compete between vintage collisions and certainly not exciting animations and do so in front of an audience whose quality is paradoxically superior to that of the players, complete with a reflection on the parquet. It's a pity that viewers are as motionless as statues of salt leading us, together with everything else, to prefer the two-dimensional view and to ask ourselves why Cyanide and Umix don't rely on a different solution, perhaps even more modest but capable of conveying some emotion. Yet we can already find what we are talking about in the portraits which, although stylized and not very varied, are undoubtedly the most valuable artistic element of the entire production. On the other hand, predictably, the soundtrack is entirely entrusted to the inevitable laminated music that characterizes the Cyanide style. Some songs are even listenable, especially when piano and Latin-style percussion come into play, but after a handful of loops it is almost inevitable to resort to mute and launch your own custom soundtrack. And while we're doing it, we're going to close by talking about an element, the emotional one, which perhaps won't matter to statistics fanatics but when it comes to video games it can weigh like a boulder. Cyanide managerial includes the satisfaction of the public, also linked to streaks of victories and steals, and that of the board of directors, which can lead to us being fired, as well as allowing us to reward players and observe the behavior of each individual member of the team. But given the evolution of the managerial genre we would have expected a more marked psychological dimension, the tangible presence of the media and some innovations capable of making a title unique beyond the complexity of statistics or micro management. All this is still missing in Pro Basketball Manager 2016 and the combination with an artistic sector that is certainly not exciting is lethal for involvement. From this point of view, the coup de grce would seem to be given by the lack of adaptation in Italian even if, having removed the rumors, it is sufficient to know a handful of sports terms and basketball slang to orient oneself very well.", "date": "2016-01-14", "grade": "7.0"}
