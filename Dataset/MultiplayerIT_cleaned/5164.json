The bizarre sequence of words attached to each other gives a good idea of what we are required to do within the video game in question: essentially running, jumping and shooting in a good mix between runner game and classic shooter staged with excellent sci-fi characterization of yesteryear. On paper it doesn't seem to offer anything different from the infinity of runner games and similar derivations that invade the mobile market, and in fact the basic structure offers practically nothing innovative, but the way in which the elements are composed creates the picture complete with the game cannot fail to strike the more experienced gamer, both for the particular choices made in the stylistic field and for the rhythm applied to the action, the scenarios and a certain attention to the level design that clearly shines through after a few games. All this contributes to making RunGunJumpGun a title capable of standing out from the crowd, with a characterization that obviously winks at some classic productions such as Metroid or Turrican, obviously making the necessary proportions: within a solar system in destruction, with With the main star dying, an astronaut explorer finds himself racing against time across multiple environments, trying to gather resources from ruined worlds before it's too late. The story is not really the main point of the game, but it contributes to create a rather particular atmosphere, with this feeling together of frenzied speed and sense of impending doom, combined with a perfectly ~lo-fi~ graphic style that recalls the classics in pixel of the space shooter genre. All very much in line with the old school, therefore, except for one detail: all we have to do is press two buttons. Let's go back to the glories of the vintage space shooter but in a modern key with RunGunJumpGun Run, jump and shoot So here's the main point: the protagonist automatically runs to the right side of the screen and all we have to do is make sure he reaches the end of the levels unscathed using only two commands, with one key to shoot down and one to fire forward, which results in jumping and attacking. The simplicity of the control system should not mislead you, in any case, because the pace imposed on the action makes even these two single actions particularly complicated. The levels are very short, all of which can be completed in about 30 seconds or less, but they are full of obstacles and strategically placed enemies to complicate the player's life. The meaning is to try to refine the rhythm of the action and the sensitivity on the two commands to the maximum and the level design leverages this need to act with perfect timing and total fluidity, because the slightest mistake cannot be forgiven and immediately returns to start of the level. The shot causes consequences that introduce another mechanic to take into account for the control of the protagonist, with the knockback of the downward fire that can be used to keep him suspended like a sort of jetpack, a move that immediately becomes of fundamental importance to overcome obstacles and perhaps collect the power-ups, so-called ~atomik~, in the most difficult places (and later introduces particular variations on the theme in the underwater areas). The levels are therefore extremely short to compensate for their extreme intensity and the speed at which they are visited, but there is a certain care in the rhythm of the action through the way in which the elements are arranged within them, all things that combine to stimulate the constant attempts to always go a little further in this mad race towards total destruction. The graphic style adopted is obviously a 2D with a strongly nostalgic flavor, but filtered through a stylized and particularly lively vision, made up of strong colors and contrasts, with the use of transparencies and constantly moving sprites that create a truly particular atmosphere, all supported by a soundtrack of effects and chiptune music able to underline the sense of impending threat and the alien nature of these strange worlds on the verge of collapse.", "date": "2016-11-17", "grade": "8.3"}
