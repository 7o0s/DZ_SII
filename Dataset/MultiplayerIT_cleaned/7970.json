The attempt by Crystal Dynamics to start from scratch should therefore be welcomed with great respect, telling us the story of a new Lara Croft who does not have melons instead of breasts nor the temper of a seasoned warrior, but who rather presents herself as a girl ~ normal~, of a clean and plausible beauty, in whose veins flows the blood of great explorers but who is not yet aware of its potential. During an expedition to the so-called ~Dragon Triangle~, the ship on which Lara and other explorers travel ends up in the middle of a sudden and violent storm, which literally splits the hull in two and transforms the girl and her companions into shipwrecks on an island that seems uninhabited. As often happens, however, appearances are deceiving: the ancient ruins that dot this wild place alternate with slums controlled by a group of religious fanatics, armed to the teeth and anything but hospitable towards those who invade their territory. However, the gameplay of Tomb Raider is not based on the mere confrontation between a Lara ~in the making~ and this band of assassins, but on the relationship with the island as a whole, with the many threats that hide behind every tree, cave or street of water. Last but not least, with an exploratory vein that certainly could have been developed better but which in any case leads the player, with curiosity, to enter the cave on the right rather than the one on the left, which would instead lead him towards his goal; to jump on the roof of a temple because from a distance there seems to be something glittering; to grapple with many nice challenges that involve interaction with the scenario. Little Women grow up However, the glue of all the experiences offered by Tomb Raider is the narration, which is clearly inspired by the cinematographic style of Uncharted as regards the presence of cutscenes inserted in the middle of the action, in a dynamic and convincing way, and which sacrifices the characterization of the supporting actors in favor of the protagonist. Lara, who finds within herself a strength she didn't know she had and manages to shoulder the weight of a mission that is anything but easy, given the forces in the field; who fills his arms with cuts, takes fearful beatings but always manages to get back up. The developers have fielded very solid solutions as regards the control of the character, the exploratory phases, climbing the rock walls and, last but not least, the combat system. At first we will be able to count only on a rough bow, hinting at hunting mechanics which, as highlighted in the review of the console edition, seem to have found no place in the final version of the game. The feedback from this tool is still good, you have to stretch the string to the maximum to be able to shoot an arrow capable of killing a target with a single shot, especially if we hit its head, but the arsenal expands quickly and allows us to wield a pistol, a shotgun and a machine gun, all of which can be upgraded in various ways using the materials that Lara can find around and which stimulate the observation of the locations. You can choose to eliminate enemies silently, for example with an arrow in the back of the head when they are alone or at a distance from their companions or by taking them from behind and suffocating them with a bow. The implementation of this situation appears very valid, also and above all in the presence of explosive barrels that can help us clean up in one fell swoop, or interesting expedients (for example hitting a nearby wall) that allow us to separate groups of guards thus to deal with them individually. However, it is in the open firefights that the similarities with Uncharted return, and let's just say that it's not a bad thing at all. In fact, Tomb Raider's gunplay lives up to expectations, with some uncertainty only in very short distances (but you need to understand well how dodging and physical attack work, often determined by an ~on the fly~ quick time event) and a artificial intelligence of the opponents above average, also similar to that seen in the Naughty Dog title. Our opponents are sometimes foolish enough to leave their heads uncovered, it's true, but at the same time they avoid static ambushes, move from side to side, advance and make our cover unusable by throwing Molotov cocktails. In short, their offensiva is plausible and in the end the deficiencies in terms of routine appear globally insignificant. Watch your hair The Roman saying above sums up very well the most talked about technical feature of the PC version of Tomb Raider, or the TressFX technology. It is a system that manages our character's hair in a plausible way, giving the individual strands their own texture, avoiding interpenetration and thus leaving Lara's hair free to flutter in the wind. As you may have read, several users of GeForce video cards have had problems with activating this feature, which actually causes a drop in the frame rate for a very simple reason: the TressFX was created by AMD and optimized for its cards. However, Crystal Dynamics has made itself available to resolve the problem with NVIDIA and we look forward to an update that will fix everything. However, the point is another and we would like to raise it right here: are we sure that a realistic view of the hair is what we want in a video game? The action we see on the screen, increasingly defined and rich in detail with the passage of time and configurations, is in fact closer in terms of aesthetics to a CG cartoon rather than a film, and even in the latter the make -up makes sure that actors with long hair don't spend two-thirds of their time brushing it out of their eyes. What we mean is that TressFX, at least as it appears at the moment, seems to us to be a far from essential feature. Fortunately, there is much more to be happy about: with all settings at ultra level, vsync deactivated and FXAA, Tomb Raider turns out to be quite light and scores from 30 to 60 FPS (depending on whether the scenario is open or closed) on test setup, not quite a PC ninja. The improvements compared to what we saw on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are notable in terms of depth of field, surface quality (Tessellation is supported, among other things), texture definition and management of light sources, with large focus protagonist of many exploratory phases. In short, beyond the controversial issue of TressFX, we can talk about an excellent conversion and undoubtedly the best version of the game currently available.", "date": "2013-03-08", "grade": "8.5"}
