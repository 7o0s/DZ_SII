Probably only very few have never heard of it and have never seen some gathering of enthusiasts who challenge each other to the sound of strategy with their cards in hand. It is undoubtedly the most famous card game in circulation, born in 1992 and grown so much as to become a phenomenon and above all the progenitor of a series of games that have taken their ~inspiration~ from Magic. The Planeswalkers version is the latest variant of the almost infinite universe of cards that characterize the system created by Wizards of the Coast and certainly a new version dedicated to console and PC users could not be missing. All downloading Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is available for download via the digital distribution services Steam, Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, at a cost of 800 MP - approximately 9 euros. This new creature developed by Stainless Games was born with a dual purpose: not to displease card game enthusiasts and therefore insert a few changes to the previous incarnation, and try not to discourage possible new users who would never start a title too much complex with an infinite number of cards to select. After our careful test we can say that the sequel is the happy medium between these two completely antipode needs. If on the one hand we can say that the improvements compared to the predecessor have been many and have a heavy impact on the game, which has become deeper but at the same time much easier to manage in terms of gameplay, on the other we cannot hide that the tutorial inserted is perfect and after a few games you become fully masters of the situation. The player then, depending on the selected level of aid and difficulty, can be decisively supported by the artificial intelligence which reminds him to block an attack or offers suggestions on which cards to present on the table. Now let's take a step back to explain what exactly Duels of the Planeswalker 2012 is all about and its main mode: the Campaign. After a small hint of the plot, which perhaps only true Magic fans can appreciate, you start being able to choose two different decks, Green and White while the first level serves as a tutorial for the game. After the first victory it is possible to start moving through different challenges against other Planeswalkers which give the possibility to unlock new cards, up to 16 for each deck, real new decks of different colors and above all only by being victorious in some decisive challenges we will be able to progress in levels. If the fights against opposing Planeswalkers are the heart of the game, we must highlight that these are alternated with interesting one-round encounters, called Challenges, in which we must resolve the issue with a few significant plays. In practice they remember the puzzles of the previous episode only this time they are integrated directly into the campaign and are unlocked by continuing in the single player. The fights alternate between the phases of land and creature placement, upgrading, enchantments, and combat. This management of the different phases runs out very quickly (so much so that it is possible to pause the game to better think about the moves to be made) and the control via the pad is absolutely perfect. The same applies to the combination of mouse and keyboard, the latter in particular can also be configured in the key assignment. Card management during the first few games requires constant use of the zoom, entrusted to the right trigger or the mouse wheel, to discover the details of the individual creatures and their abilities. It is not possible to get out of these rigid limits imposed by the developers and we cannot act on the cards outside the pre- and post-combat phase, just to not complicate the current session too much. So forget pro Magic actions with instants cast during the draw or discard phase or sorceries with repercussions in the upkeep phase. I'll make you the deck! The game contains 10 different decks from single color to bolder combinations of 2 and even 3 colors. Overall we have hundreds of different cards from the last two blocks of Magic: The Gathering (Scars of Mirrodin and Zendikar), the last two core sets, and some preview cards from Core Set 2012. We then noticed a handful of cards that did the history of Magic from 1993 to today, almost a sort of very best of. Xbox 360 goals The 200 points that characterize the tititle developed by Stainless Games are divided into 12 objectives almost entirely dedicated to the single player game mode. To get them all you need to spend several hours and master your deck. Don't forget to play the Challenges otherwise it is not possible to get to the full loot. Beyond the countryside The challenges proved to be very satisfying throughout the adventure and at times very complicated: it is necessary to ~grow~ more than one deck in order to face the strongest Planeswalkers. We in particular liked playing with the white deck or with an advanced blue-green one but only with these we weren't able to go too far and therefore had to turn to other colors as well. So let's come to the big limit, evidently wanted by the developers, and that is the very limited possibility of customizing one's own set of cards. Each color has 16 new cards that are unlocked after each win. You won't need 16 different clashes since the cards are often in groups of 2 or 3 and are made available all together. The player is left free to decide which ones to insert in the deck and which ones to eliminate from the deck. The real problem is that the customization ends here: it is not possible to choose different lands or change their number which is instead calculated automatically as the cards increase. More generally, it is not possible to mix colors, in short, to create decks from scratch using the cards present in Duels of the Planeswalker and the decks can never go below 60 cards. Compared to the predecessor, however, it is evident that the sets present are more complex and profound, the perfect management of each color requires many games, after all a too broad modification possibility would certainly have frightened new users. In addition to the classic Campaign, we will be able to face two other unlockable ones: Archenemy and Revenge. While the latter follows the standard one with simply more powerful opponents thanks to enhanced decks, the real novelty is the three-on-one clash in the Archenemy mode where the solitary player is enhanced by cards capable of simultaneously defeating the three opposing players, the so-called edicts . The sore point of this mode is the impossibility of impersonating the solitary player, given that it is always and only managed by artificial intelligence. Obviously there is both online and local multiplayer with more or less classified matches, the classic free for all up to four, two against two and the new Archenemy mode. From a technical point of view there is little to say: the redesign of the interface works very well and is capable of managing the presentation of the cards on the table without uncertainty; perhaps the damage system to the opponent and to our character could have been made a little more spectacular. The cards have been recreated perfectly in every detail, in high definition and it is a pleasure for the eyes to enjoy the splendid illustrations that enrich them. True graphic art lovers will be amazed by the intermission screens, in which the beautiful paintings of the artists of Wizards of the Coast are played in full screen.", "date": "2011-06-27", "grade": "8.0"}
