{"name": "Uno a me e UNO al Wii", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72789-uno-uno-a-me-e-uno-al-wii.html", "text": "The Game is available for download on the WiiWare service. The popular UNO card game, known to all, has been re-proposed since its inception in a thousand variants and versions, including the very latest already appreciated on home consoles. Nintendo Wii (but also DSi) today proposes the great classic in its original version, downloadable through that forge of digital delivery games that responds to the name of Wii Ware. It is not necessary to explain every rule that distinguishes UNO (there are many), but suffice it to say that it is a card game that lends itself by nature to multiplayer use. Thanks to the Wi-Fi Connection we can set up customized or ranked games online, with the possibility of inviting friends using the famous ~codes~, or challenging participants from all over the world. It is also possible to enter a special ranking of the best players (almost all Japanese at the moment). UNO's cards are paired by color or number, and the ultimate goal is to get rid of them completely first, and then count those left in the opponent's hands. Each card has a score, which varies from the figure indicated up to 20 for special cards, and the player who gets a certain number of points wins. One of the characteristics of UNO is to be fast, frantic, no-brain, mostly associated with luck, but not only. On Wii you choose the cards to discard by pointing the remote control, a precise control method but never enough when it comes to having to scroll through many cards all very close together. It would have been preferable to have the possibility of being able to use the digital cross to ~scroll~ the deck, a slightly slower but inevitably safer method for not making a mistake in selecting a card. By winning games and tournaments you can unlock some elements such as different backgrounds and decks, a factor that leads you to continue and always look for new victories. Furthermore, by modifying the game settings, some special rules can be activated such as the introduction of zero and seven cards (special cards without rules), the ~leapfrog~ which allows you to play even outside your turn, and the various disputes against your opponents. Too bad there aren't deeper game variants that you can activate (there are a lot of them, actually) that can make the gaming experience even more varied and different. Let's think, for example, of the advance or of the white cards that allow you to steal the opponent's deck. Curiosity Despite the worldwide fame, the originality of UNO is however very doubtful. There are very old games that use an identical mechanism. In Italy, for example, a variant is widespread which, depending on the region, is called Dernier or Ultima. Similar games are found all over the world, with various titles. In Anglo-Saxon countries a special category is even identified for these games, called shedding, which include, among others, Crazy Eights, Taki, Macau. The features of the Wii version UNO for Wii makes very good use of some features of the console that other games often don't even contemplate. First of all the online multiplayer, where you can always find many people available without waiting, thanks to the tremendous worldwide popularity of this title. But not only that, it is also possible to connect the Wii-Speak peripheral to be able to speak directly with the players we are facing, a system used so far by Animal Crossing and The Conduit. The chat works properly as long as we are talking to one friend at a time, but it raises some concerns when two voices overlap, or a friend of our friend tries to communicate directly with us. The friend code system prevents you from being able to get in touch with another player without exchanging them. However, those who do not have a microphone can count on a pre-set messaging system on the same model as Mario Kart, with pre-written phrases selectable from a convenient window menu. Furthermore, during the game screen, we can admire our Miis that move and interact with each other (a bit like the avatars of the UNO version of Xbox Live). The aesthetic component is essential to the game, but well designed to allow the simultaneous display of four decks of cards, the central waste deck, all the Miis and the text chat menu. The musical accompaniment is discreet and quite cadenced, so as not to be invasive or repetitive. UNO is available in the Wii-Shop and can be downloaded for 500 points.", "date": "2009-12-11", "grade": "7.5"}
