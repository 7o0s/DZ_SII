After the review of Football Manager 2019 in its traditional guise for PC and that of Football Manager 2019 Touch for tablets and Nintendo Switch, the effort of Sports Interactive also arrives on the market in the form of Football Manager 2019 Mobile. As it is rather easy to guess from the name, this is the edition of the game specifically designed for mobile phones, therefore designed by the developers led by Miles Jacobson to provide an immediate experience suitable for movement by those who cannot stand in front of the computer and cannot he wants to give up on his own climb to footballing glory. All without, however, completely forgetting the simulation roots of what is currently the only football manager of a certain level left on the square. Just this year, Football Manager 2019 Mobile in fact has some elements that will not fail to satisfy those looking for a slightly more articulated gameplay, without overdoing it but with good additions in the right places. Equipped with our smartphone, we therefore took advantage of this opportunity to sit back on our bench. Gameplay: welcome news For obvious reasons, Football Manager 2019 Mobile is the least well-stocked of the trio from a content point of view, but as we said earlier, this new edition brings with it elements capable of making a difference with the past. The most important changes concern training management, now customizable for each member of the team through three different parameters: intensity, how to interpret one's role and any attribute on which to focus to improve one's performance on the pitch. In the same screen we are also offered a small report from the assistant coach, containing the strengths and weaknesses of the player we are examining, together with the outcome of the last training sessions. Moving on to the section dedicated to the market, the addition of real-time negotiations, which has been an integral part of the desktop version of Football Manager for some time now, is very welcome: thanks to this feature, it becomes possible to negotiate more quickly with the other teams in the price definition phase of the card, without being forced to press the Continue button to get the answer to your proposals. The same goes for the definition of contracts with incoming players and those already present in the club, with whom it is possible to speak in a single screen to reach the final agreement (or break). In case you are looking for challenges in particular leagues, Football Manager 2019 Mobile includes clubs and competitions from Russia and China, especially in the latter case tickling those who intend to jump into an oriental adventure. Speaking of challenges, there is also the section that offers us to take the lead of a team in some particular situations, such as a problematic classification with a few rounds to go or a locker room decimated by injuries. Microtransactions The smartphone soul of Football Manager 2019 Mobile emerges thanks to the presence in the game of some microtransactions, linked to various aspects of the title developed by Sports Interactive. In fact, in the integrated shop it is possible to buy some elements capable of making our experience as a coach more carefree, such as the purchase of the club by a tycoon who intends to invest good money in it or absolute immunity from exemption. There are also some additional challenges available, which complement those distributed for free with the game upon purchase. The most expensive element is the editor, to obtain which you have to shell out 9.99 euros: practically the same price at which the entire Football Manager 2019 Mobile is sold. Interface and gameplay Switching from a PC monitor to a smartphone screen naturally means adapting the appearance of your title to the small size of the screen. In the case of a game like Football Manager it is a big nut to crack, given the amount of information that makes up the life of each manager. However, the work done by Sports Interactive proves to be good, allowing you to have all the team settings within a few steps without getting lost in the various menus and settings. This is perhaps the reason why the developers have preferred to set up the tactics differently from the new module seen in the other two versions of Football Manager 2019. To define the style of play we still have a general screen available, accompanied by the behavior of the team in the two situations of attack and defense. On the pitch, the match is represented with the classic two-dimensional engine, enriched by the goal replay function andsince the arrival of the VAR. Compared to our past encounters with Football Manager Mobile, the difficulty of the game seemed a little higher, in particular requiring adequate preparation of the match based on the level of the opponent you are facing to set up a more prudent or offensive style . Even on the iPhone 7 Plus the sustained uploads while progressing in the game are short enough not to make it difficult to wait for their completion, an aspect that is appreciated especially when we want to load a save to play a game on the fly before to go back to the things we were previously dealing with. The graphic style embraces the violet chosen by Sports Interactive as this year's distinctive brand, guaranteeing a good seal in terms of eye fatigue even if you spend some time immersed in Football Manager 2019 Mobile.", "date": "2018-12-11", "grade": "8.0"}
