That's because Bob grew up to be a national hero in the military, while John was a money-seeking criminal who, envious of his friend's success, framed him as a corrupt soldier, unleashing the wrath of what once was. one of his companions and who now has the sole purpose of finding him and taking revenge with smoking bullets. This is in summary the ~historical~ background of Guerrilla Bob, a third-person action title developed by Chillingo, the same as the famous Mini Gore, which offer the classic dual-stick control scheme on the iPhone screen: on the left you command the movement of the main character, on the right instead the direction of the shot, obviously at 360 degrees and independently. No prisoners Bob's revenge unfolds through a single player mode that includes eight levels, within which you have to reach the end of the path making your way through the various enemies. The main protagonist is equipped with three different weapons, a sort of machine gun, a rocket launcher and a flamethrower, which can be upgraded by collecting some objects scattered around the game map. The opponents themselves differ in type and need to be attacked accordingly, in fact we have the bombers who try to blow themselves up on contact, the grenade launchers, those who take cover behind some sandbags, mobile turrets and the inevitable end-of-level bosses , which are represented by a nice little scene that introduces them and have a special energy bar, on the right of the screen. On the left, however, there is a cigar that represents Bob's vitality, and there is no shortage of gadgets to restore part of it or temporarily increase speed, defense or firepower. Once the game has been completed according to one of the two difficulty levels present, you enter the Survival mode, which takes up Mini Gore very closely and within which you have to resist the enemy waves as long as possible. The control system works excellently and the presence of opponents with different characteristics leads to moving a lot on the playing field, attacking from a distance or up close depending on the situation or using the appropriate weapon for the type of boss. All this is well calibrated and quite funny, assisted by the fact that Bob often accompanies his killings with defiant and ironic phrases, which contribute well to creating the atmosphere. However, such an interesting structure lacks variety and longevity, where the main campaign can be completed in an hour and a half and where the different situations proposed to the player are limited to a few variations on the theme such as for example a boss chasing Bob with a bulldozer or a raid on a raft while attached to both sides of the river. It remains a fun title that also stands out on a graphic level, with an excellent 3D and general style, perfect fluidity and good animations, for a definitely positive glance. Also in this case there is little variety, with maps that are not too dissimilar to each other and which alternate only between day and night. The last interesting note to report is the fact that Guerrilla Bob represents the forerunner for Crystal, newborn and yet another Social Network like Xbox Live which provides online rankings, statistics, friends list and achievements. The graphical interface seemed very clear and well structured to us, even if for now, thanks to the fact that the service has just been born and has only one title, it does not seem to be present within the gamertag any global score that serves to keep track of all unlocked achievements overall.
