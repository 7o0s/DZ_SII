{"name": "Una conversione da favola?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88679-fable-iii-una-conversione-da-favola.html", "text": "Fable III, on the PC side, was one of the titles with which Microsoft wanted to reaffirm for the umpteenth time its intentions of seriousness towards a user who has been adopting Windows for years now but, when it comes to video games, sees in other companies, Valve above all, its point of reference. And just take a tour of Steam, on the one hand, and Games for Windows Live, on the other, to understand the reasons for certain preferences. Fable III, together with Age of Empires Online and the desaparecido Flight, as a battering ram to make inroads again into an unglued user base, therefore, despite the original news followed by silences and a long delay compared to the Xbox 360 incarnation, which led to the release scheduled in Europe for May 20th. For our part, curiosity was great because the potential of the product had already been expressed in the review last October but also because this conversion promised a series of additional elements of interest. On balance, however, the result of the operation cannot be celebrated as successful, to the point that the good things offered by the package for sale at around 40 euros cannot be attributed to the efforts made during the conversion. Fable III, a compendium Peter Molyneux's welcome return to the platform that made him famous, and where he probably expressed himself best, comes from a title that closes a trilogy made up of many words and a progressive work of effective implementation of the promises. On balance for a designer who has always made originality his trademark, the Fable series represents a project successfully completed: the world of Albion is interesting and original, as are many of the proposed missions and most of the interactions with non-player characters are unique, not experienced elsewhere. The adventure is divided into two sections: where in the first, the main one, the classic quest is undertaken to prepare for the defeat of the villain of the moment - the older brother, regent of Albion since the father of the protagonist, King and alter ego of the player in Fable II, he is dead - in the second you experience the aftermath, with a kingdom to manage before the final threat comes to endanger Albion's very existence. The action system is several times higher than the role-playing one in the experience economy, a precise choice that also affects fights strongly based on timing and strictly in real time. Legitimate design choices, which may be more or less liked depending on one's tastes but which overall can be said to have been properly implemented according to the original vision. The approximately fifteen hours necessary to complete Fable III therefore flow between the main characters who are children of a fantasy world in full industrialization, and a slice of secondary encounters who are not asked to characterize the game universe and for this reason they can indulge themselves in often found also very tasty. The title remains, on balance, the only one where you experience founds like entire quests set in the literary worlds invented by a bizarre author of plays, where you walk around dressed as a hen and work hard to destroy a marriage at the specific request of the husband , desperate by his wife's petulance. Not to mention adventures set in special dioramas and various other ideas, in many cases properly supported by excellent humor and a refined artistic component. Certainly it cannot be defined as a hardcore experience, but for those looking for a hybrid title that mixes action, curious social interactions and RPG elements, Fable III represents an interesting choice. PC focus? As mentioned at the beginning, the PC version of Fable III was presented as having a series of additions that should have accompanied the strictly technical conversion work. The biggest addition is certainly the Challenge mode: to respond to the complaints raised by Xbox 360 users, who asked for a higher difficulty rate, the developers have strengthened the opponents and, above all, made it necessary to use potions and the like to regain life points lost in combat. Too bad that when you die - and now it happens frequently, unless you have a good number of medicinal items - and before you come back to life exactly at the same point where you switched to the creator, the only penalty is the loss of the progress made in the collection of the later Seal of the Guild of Heroes. These are used to unlock skills, enhance those possessed, collect new interactions with NPCs and increase the complexity of the three jobs in the game, but they are earned with such ease that the penalty described above is not felt as dreally important, especially in the first three quarters of the adventure. The challenge only apparently rises therefore, due to a compromise that does not undermine the balance of the game but at the same time disappoints the expectations towards this novelty. The commands, if desired, are still manageable via pad - for those in possession of them - and this remains the preferable choice given that the keyboard plus mouse configuration is not free from gaps. If the management of attacks with the two mouse buttons, to which is added the use of the scroll wheel to scroll between the sword, the gun and the magic selected, works properly, there are indeed some impractical legacies of the console version. For example, a large part of the actions to be performed requires an unjustifiably long press, while for some reason it often happens that this is not even shown, forcing us to work the camera on the object or character of our interest until we are given the opportunity to interact with it . With firearms then, when aiming, the feeling is that the acceleration that the mouse would allow to simulate has not been properly implemented. The layout of the menus was evidently good on the console, but it lacks any shortcut or possibility of customizing the keys on the keyboard, which prevents, for example, from directly calling up the map or the weapons room or the dressing room. From a technical point of view it is a punctual conversion of the Xbox 360 version, as mentioned truly artistically suggestive but certainly not able to undermine the most extreme configurations. Indeed yes, because unfortunately despite the default cap being at 30 images per second and, precisely, the detail cannot be defined as incredible, there were drops when we tried to replace the pair of GTX 460 with a Radeon HD 4890, which new it's not but it seems to bring home better results with Crysis 2 than with Fable III. The last big enemy of this conversion is the competition which, on PC, is really strong. It is simply difficult to make him come out the winner of comparisons such as the entire Drakensang saga sold in the shop for twenty euros, or Divinity which is deeper and more articulated at the same price. Or the newly released The Witcher 2. Or the entire Mount and Blade proposal and its sequels. Or in perspective to the various Torchligh 2 and Diablo III. Of course he is one of the few who can count on an online cooperative, but the PC landscape is full of multiplayer role-playing experiences, thanks to the MMO front.", "date": "2011-05-17", "grade": "7.0"}
