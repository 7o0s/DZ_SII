{"name": "Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/onimusha-dawn-of-dreams-2.html", "text": "A little refresher The now long-lived Onimusha saga begins with Onimusha: Warlords, where the samurai Samanosuke Akechi is helped by the Oni tribe (a sort of warrior demons) to defeat Nobunaga Oda, the feudal lord who conquered many Japanese territories in the second half of the 1500s without wanting to see titles or honors recognized. In the fictional Capcom title, Nobunaga is killed during the Battle of Okehazama by an arrow and then resurrected by evil Genma demons. Samanosuke, modeled after the actor Takeshi Kaneshiro, is also a historical figure, i.e. the nephew of Mitshuhide Akechi, the man who actually killed Nobunaga. In his exploits, Samanosuke is helped by Kaede, a kunoichi (female ninja) who provides him with information and occasionally helps him in battles and in solving puzzles. Onimusha: Warlords takes the mechanics of Resident Evil (2D backdrops, 3D characters and fixed shots) adding more action and boasting an engaging story and a well-designed game system. The title was immediately a great success and Capcom did not miss the opportunity to churn out a sequel. A little refresher In the second chapter ~Samurai's Destiny~, Samanosuke temporarily leaves the scene to Jubei Yagyu, a historical figure inspired by Yagyu Muneyoshi (and not Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi, as many believe, who was instead his grandfather) the founder of the Yagyu Shinkage-ryu school. Although Nobunaga had never had anything to do with the Yagyu clan, Capcom chooses this high-sounding historical figure to appeal to the Japanese public, who know the character well. Also this time the protagonist is equipped with the features of an actor: Yusaku Matsuda. Many pseudo-RPG elements are added to the game, which sports improved graphics but still has two-dimensional backdrops, and based on a system of items that can be gifted and establish a certain degree of friendship, Jubei can have al at his side more or less frequently several adventure companions: the ninja Kotaro Fuma, the well-fed monk Ekei Ankokuji, the rifleman Magoichi Saiga and the attractive Oichi, a historical figure who in reality was Nobunaga's sister and never knew any member of the Yagyu clan. Once again Nobunaga manages to get away with it somehow, and everything is therefore postponed to the third chapter. A little refresher Onimusha 3: Demon siege is the final chapter of the saga in which Nobunaga Oda figures as the main enemy, but it is not the last of the Onimusha series. For the occasion, Capcom gloriously returns Samanosuke Akechi to the scene, supported by none other than Jacques Blanc, a French policeman who takes up the features of the famous actor Jean Reno. Now on the threshold of forty years but kept young by the Oni power, Samanosuke discovers that the efforts produced to kill the demon Fortinbras (at the end of Onimusha 1) were useless: Nobunaga has in fact acquired even more power and proclaimed himself ~king of the demons~. The samurai then decides to track down Nobunaga in his estate at the Honnoji temple, but something unexpected happens during the battle: time portals appear out of nowhere that throw Samanosuke into present-day Paris, and almost simultaneously the policeman Jacques Blanc into Japan in 1582. From here begins a cross-over adventure, in which the Japanese hero is controlled half of the time and the French one for the other half (with the sporadic help of Michelle Aubert, Jacuqes' girlfriend). The transalpine policeman is helped on his way by the Oni clan, who entrust him with the goblin (tengu) Ako and a glove like Samanosuke's which has the power to materialize a whip of energy. Eventually the group will reunite and finally Samanosuke will be able to return to his era to definitively defeat Nobunaga. Onimusha 3 is the title of the saga that definitively marks the transition from 2D to 3D environments, giving players excellent graphics and a style of play that returns more similar to that of the first episode, eliminating the almost useless frills introduced in ~Samurai's destiny. In the final sequence, after the credits, Capcom implicitly announces the fourth chapter of the saga by showing Nobunaga's right hand man, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, as he rides at the head of an army, sporting the ordinarily red eyes of those possessed by demons. But that's another story, as you will see as you read on. The dawn of dreams Fifteen years after Nobunaga's death, the activities of the evil Genma demons have not stopped at all, and led by Emperor Hideyoshi Toyotomi (or, more likely, by an unknown entity who controls him) they are rampant throughout the paese. The evil tyrant's intent is to transform the entire Japanese population into an invincible army of man-demons thanks to the power of cursed cherry trees, which with their own petals can infect people almost instantly. The most congenial occasion to carry out a mass infection is the flowering festival, a national holiday held every year in Kyoto (then the capital of Japan) and attended by a very large number of citizens. It is at this point in the story that Soki comes into play, the new protagonist of the saga who definitively dismisses Yubei Yagyu and Samanosuke Akechi. Soki is the first hero of the Onimusha series not to take his features from an actor, and this, the Capcom leaders explain, was decided for pure copyright reasons: in doing so, the Japanese software house is less bound to produce gadgets and various marketing of Onimusha Dawn of dreams. From the very beginning we discover that Soki, once loyal to the emperor, was driven to betrayal by the evil deeds committed by Hideyoshi, and now he is doing his utmost to bring down the genma and prevent the flowering festival with all his might . the appearance of this new protagonist initially leaves us somewhat dumbfounded, not being at all faithful to the canons of the series nor to those of feudal Japan The dawn of dreams The appearance of this new protagonist initially leaves us somewhat dumbfounded, not being at all faithful to the canons of the series nor even less to those of feudal Japan: Soki sports blonde hair, blue armor and a look more suitable for a modern-day posh than to a great samurai of the time. However, doubts about the validity of the character are largely dispelled by continuing with the game, when the personality and the undoubted charisma with which the Capcom designers characterized the bizarre samurai gradually emerge. The adventure takes place in the period of time between 1596 and 1600, and this time the inspiration given by historical facts that really happened is more than marginal, with some isolated reference from time to time; what is not missing, however, is the usual charge of Japanese folklore and symbolism, which contributes to increasing an undoubtedly generous and palpable atmosphere. The plot conceived for Dawn of dreams is not without twists and involves the user from the beginning, but once again, although the possibility is given to revisit the places already explored, the game turns out to be rather linear and it does not allow you to choose alternative paths or complete a particular mission in different ways. The narration runs smooth and exciting for most of the time, but on two or three occasions the events accelerate inexplicably, and as a result important passages are cut, or passages that in any case would have been pleasant to ~live~; this inevitably leaves the feeling that the programmers have done things in a hurry, as if they had suddenly been chased by one of the demons born of their imagination. Cloak and dagger At first glance it might seem that the fourth Onimusha is a natural sequel to the third chapter: same control system, same type of environments in three dimensions, combos, special moves and very similar spells. But in reality, as we will see later, there is more. For those unfamiliar with this series, we can summarize by saying that Onimusha is a sort of mix between action and hack & slash with a setting and atmosphere reminiscent of survival horror and some RPG influences. Less rowdy than a Devil May Cry but much more frenetic than any Resident Evil, in Onimusha you try to get the better of monsters and demons with bladed weapons (and occasionally even with some nice crackling). Once killed, the monsters release particular ~souls~ which guarantee different effects based on their color: they can return vital energy, magic energy, Oni energy or simply, in the case of the red ones, be used as a sort of currency for the enhancement of souls. weapons. In addition to the favorite weapon, each character has Oni magic at his disposal, which based on the element with which the weapon itself is forged in that moment (air, earth, fire, ice or darkness) is unleashed on enemies with different. [C] This guy isn't either. certainly counted among the enemies most; fearsome As you can see, it can be keep an eye on the energy and magic level of both controlled characters [/C] the replayability factor is good, especially if you aim to collect all the weapons and all the objects. Cloak and dagger In situations of extreme danger it is also possible to resort to the greatest power, the On transformationi, which can be accumulated thanks to particular ~souls~ released by monsters at the time of death and once used it makes them temporarily invincible and particularly powerful in attacks. The controls are fluid and effective, and you never have problems executing special moves and combinations of hits, which are less difficult to achieve (the famous and difficult ~10 hit-combo~ of Onimusha 3 has also been eliminated). Counterattacks (or critical attacks) also seem slightly easier to execute, but they still have the strange habit of failing for no reason from time to time, and not always following the directions given during chained criticals properly. Following the trend of recent years that I will never stop criticizing, the generic enemies but above all the final bosses are less belligerent than ever, so much so that, to give a contreto example, while in Onimusha 1 I remember being dead at least five or six times already at the first end-of-level monster, in Dawn of dreams I kicked the bucket for the first time after more than 15 hours of play, when I was already on the second DVD. If the ~normal~ level had been as challenging as the ~hard~ level (which is unlocked once you finish the game), perhaps everything would have been more balanced. On the other hand, the replayability factor is good, especially if you aim to collect all the weapons and all the objects. The news After awkwardly trying to introduce some elements of the role-playing game in the second chapter, this time at Capcom they decided to try it with a little more conviction, and while maintaining the proven structure of action hack & slash in Dawn of dreams numerous influences purely RPGs. The first thing worthy of mention is a spartan method of party management: as you continue in the game you meet different characters who then become usable, but while according to the plot the group always moves and fights united, in practice you will have to choose from time to time only one other fighter to join Soki. So far nothing particularly anomalous: managing more than two characters at the same time would be uncomfortable, chaotic and would distort the game scheme. Contrary to the fact that in the reality of the narrative the party is always present in full in every situation, however, comes the system to change partners: it is possible to perform this operation only in the presence of the canonical mirror from which games can also be saved. If the comrades are there, physically present, why on earth do you have to resort to the mirror to choose who to help you in battle? A change of partner in real time, perhaps with just the push of a button, would have been more practical and would not have clashed with the narrative of the story itself. There is such a thing, but it is limited to the selected partner: by pressing the R2 key it is possible at any time to decide whether to control Soki or her designated sidekick, and at the same time simple orders can also be given to the character who is not controlling directly by acting on the digital cross: three commands are common (attack, follow me and attack, defend yourself) while the fourth changes from character to character, and can vary from Soki's ~absorb souls~ to Jubei's ~distract the enemy~. in Dawn of dreams numerous purely RPG influences appear The news Dawn of dreams is more exploratory than its predecessors, mainly thanks to the opportunity to revisit already completed scenarios in order to discover all their secrets. During the first visit it very often happens to see chests or objects that can only be reached thanks to the skills of certain characters, which coincidentally will not be available at that moment. Thanks to little Minokichi's teleportation skills, however, it is possible to return and complete the level definitively. In Dawn of dreams a real role-playing style character development has been introduced, with lots of experience levels and skills to be assigned gradually. Each hero starts from level 1 and by killing enemies he can accumulate points up to level 100. For each new level he earns a point to spend as he likes in one of the numerous skills, which in addition to enhancing the simple attack, defense, guard, critical strike or speed absorbing souls, they also unlock a good number of new moves. If in the past the weapons available in each Onimusha were around five or six in total, this time it was decided to change the tune, and remaining consistent with the ~role-playing facelift~ to which the game was subjected, the programmers created an average of thirty weapons for each character, all upgradeable at will. Most of them can unleash the magic linked to their element, and can even be kept", "date": "2006-03-16", "grade": null}
