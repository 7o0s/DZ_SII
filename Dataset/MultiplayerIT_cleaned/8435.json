The result is this Bellator: MMA Onslaught, which for the occasion relies on the official license of the homonymous US championship. This means finding athletes like Michael Chandler, Pat Curran and Patricio ~Pitbull~ Freire, sure to be a feast for any enthusiast. Further investigation reveals that the developers are the same as the not quite flawless MMA Supremacy, a recent title that relied on arcade immediacy. Let's see if things have improved in this all-digital release. I'll split you in two The title features eight licensed athletes and the layout of the official competition, characteristics that lead to a presentation very similar, not to say indistinguishable, from the television one. There is also the official logo, decidedly inspired by the ancient Romans. The actual tournament forces us to face the various champions with a direct elimination system, however the strong point of the Kung Fu Factory production is represented by the wrestler's editor, which provides us with a fair number of parameters to edit freely. It starts from the muscles, the shorts and even the tattoos, but the beauty comes once you get to the database of moves, even these editable, but not only. The title offers a role-playing game structure, with a progressive level system that allows our creature to grow every few experience points gained and acquire new moves. Once the basic parameters have been assigned, you enter a sort of virtual gym full of mini-games. Basically, these are tests that focus on certain moves or tricks, the overcoming of which leads to the conquest of other precious experience points, at the same time representing for the player a real functional tutorial for learning the various techniques. The game keeps track of the progress achieved both for the main tournament, which we can obviously face with our fighter, up to the online versus mode. The creation and growth of a customized fighter is therefore the beating heart of this product, we advise you not to neglect this mode, as it is the only opportunity to understand the game system. Unfortunately there is no real career, a lack that weighs significantly in a product of this type. Xbox 360 goals Bellator: MMA Onslaught features 30 objectives for a total of 400 player points. It is possible to obtain the first hundred simply with the exhibition matches and by completing the tournament, the rest however force you to try your hand at the online versus, potentially a problem in the (unfortunate) eventuality of the lack of a strong response from the users. Let's hope so. Good luck! Stronger, guys Once in the ring it is easy to understand the nature of Bellator: MMA Onslaught, oriented just like MMA Supremacy towards an arcade setting, but still not very easy to master. Another feature is the impressive visual violence, represented through devastating blows, takedowns and holds, also called submissions, which almost always end the contest. As in reality, you fight for a maximum of five rounds, but given the intoxicating speed of the fights, it's already a miracle to get to your feet in second. The controller keys are used for punch and kick combos, the backbones for dodging and parrying, while the various grips are performed with the right analog stick. We are a long way from the simulations proposed by the Electronic Arts and Yuke's titles, but Kung Fu Factory blatantly misses the mark in its attempt to offer a more accessible version of this discipline. Despite the good realization of the athletes, everything is polluted by a worrying aura of mediocrity: the animations are robotic and frankly ugly to look at, the controls don't respond very well and one has the unpleasant feeling of being at the mercy of random mechanics. The clashes often end instantly due to the influence of the stamina, a special bar placed under that of energy which, once emptied, brings the wrestler in a position to be knocked down with a single kick. The purpose is clearly not to abuse the blows to preserve the health of the aforementioned bar, but the fact remains that it is a choice that compromises the rhythm of the matches. The other way to go KO is through tricks, in this case you enter a kind of chess game dictated by theto counter moves, a field that however sees the CPU in clear advantage, being able, unlike the player, to instantly close with a submission. The lack of the commentator and music during the presentation are details that also suggest an incomplete product. The game offers an online versus mode, but unfortunately we were unable to find opponents to test it against.", "date": "2012-07-12", "grade": "5.0"}
