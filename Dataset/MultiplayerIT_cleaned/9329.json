The disappearance of Michael Jackson, which took place a year and a half ago, as often happens in these cases, made it possible to transform a figure with many chiaroscuro, professionally and humanly in decline, into an impeccable myth complete with a sensational commercial revival. Leaving aside any further reflection on the hypocrisy of the market and consumers, there is no doubt that MJ's ~brand~ is absolutely back on the crest of the wave at the level of the great glories of the good old days; and so after films, new albums and various merchandising, here comes even the posthumous video game, entitled Michael Jackson: The Experience and made by Ubisoft. Exploitation or real quality, we're here to find out... I dance like him It is certainly not the first time that Michael Jackson has made his appearance in the gaming world, and on the other hand it could not have been otherwise for a character who has traveled the most brilliant years of his career in parallel with the growth and expansion of electronic entertainment . SEGA's Moonwalker is certainly the most vivid memory, but there are also appearances in Space Channel 5 and the improbable one in Ready 2 Rumble: Round 2. With Michael Jackson: The Experience, however, Ubisoft wanted to focus in a focused way on the artist's qualities of the King of Pop, more specifically in that of excellent dancer which allowed him to give life to some of the choreography and steps that have remained in history. It is no coincidence that the product was made by the transalpine house, which for a couple of years has been enjoying the Just Dance phenomenon on Wii with great success; at this point it's really enough to do 1 + 1 to understand how Michael Jackson: The Experience is basically a version of the aforementioned casual blockbuster adapted around Jacko's character and songs. In terms of content, the numbers are more than fair: there are 27 songs, and they practically cover twenty years of career starting from the end of the 70s. The major hits are (almost) all there, as listed in the tracklist in the box opposite, and each of them is graphically set within the setting of the original video, recreated in an almost always satisfactory and faithful way, albeit with highs and bass. The choreographies, on the other hand, are also inspired by the original ones, but inevitably they have been restudied and performed by other very good dancers; this is attributable both to the need to create a game that is still accessible even by those who are not professional dancers, and to the fact that Michael Jackson: The Experience like Just Dance is played standing still on the spot, at most with a few side steps or pirouette. And again like the latter, there are dance options both purely solo, but also in pairs and in this case even in a group to involve up to 4 players simultaneously, space in the living room permitting. However, although the Ubisoft production is a casual product, the general difficulty level is certainly more demanding than that of the aforementioned Just Dance. Certainly the songs are divided in this sense between simpler or more complex, but in any case we are always talking about a title based on the steps of one of the best dancers that the world of pop has ever known; to follow the Jacko-like on screen sufficiently you need a little fluency in the movements and in any case having his majesty MJ in front of you, albeit in a virtual way, puts a bit of awe especially to those who are his old fans date. Of course, everyone has tried moonwalking or leaning forward like in Smooth Criminal in their life, but here things are a little different. In this sense, the approximate ability to detect movements does not mind that much: if you really had to exactly replicate the actions on the screen, complete with coordination between arms and legs, we would probably be talking about one of the most frustrating games of recent years. On the contrary, with only the Wiimote held in the right hand, the system limits itself to determining some movements, assuming that the rest of the body moves accordingly. Furthermore, as already mentioned in the case of Just Dance 2, complaining about this inaccuracy makes no sense; the gameplay designed by Ubisoft for this kind of product is not based on the evaluation and judgment of the user (and in fact this element is marginal and practically irrelevant), but rather the desire to offer casual and carefree fun. Finally, Michael Jackson: The Experience is a much, much more sectoral and focused product than Just Dance, less varied and devoid of important extras such as the online store. In this sense the dance school, in which a group of instructors in the flesh andd bones explains how to perform Jacko's steps through a series of instructional videos, represents nothing more than what you could find on the internet for free anyway. Move and Kinect Move: Very similar to the Nintendo Wii version, Michael Jackson The Experience on PlayStation 3 uses the combination of Move and PlayStation Eye to follow the player's movements, albeit always very roughly. You can also decide whether to dance on the basis of Jacko's complex choreographies or the more affordable ones of his crew, while by pressing the Select button you have the possibility to play a reduced version of each song. In addition, by connecting a microphone it is possible to alternate between dancing and singing performances, or letting a friend lend his voice while we squirm in improbable choreographies, and as in the Wii version it is possible to perform with three other players at the same time. The result is very interesting, and thanks to the possibility of unlocking photos, information and even dance lessons, one is encouraged to play and replay to the notes of the songs that have made the history of pop music. MJ The Experience for PS3 does not expect you to perform Jackson's steps perfectly, and in any case it would not be able to detect them, but for aesthetic care, contents and technical realization it is without a doubt the most successful version. Kinect: If the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii versions are similar to each other, both in terms of setting and control system, the Xbox 360 edition is extremely different, heavily inspired by some dance games released at the launch of the Microsoft peripheral . Similar to Dance Central and Dance Evolution, the player's goal is to try to follow as closely as possible the choreography of the dancers on screen, assuming a particular position or performing a specific movement when directed by the game. Obviously, precisely because this time it is necessary to move the whole body correctly, the Xbox 360 version is characterized by more affordable and affordable choreographies, which most often consist of repeating simple sequences or memorizing particular poses. The King Power Crown (a multiplier that works exactly like Guitar Hero's Star Power) adds a little liveliness to the songs, but unfortunately there are more or less obvious flaws. Since Kinect detects the player's body and puts him center stage, the edition for the Microsoft console is the only one of the three to (almost) never show Jackson, risking displeasing a large number of fans. Also, unlike the PS3 version, Michael Jackson The Experience for Xbox 360 features all unlocked content from the start, completely eliminating any progression or player stimulation, targeting more casual gamers who simply want to be able to immediately dance to any song on the tracklist.
