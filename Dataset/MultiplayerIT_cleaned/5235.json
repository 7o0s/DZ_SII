Those who were curious and enthusiastic enough to buy PlayStation VR on day-one are those who hope to find in viewers a new way to explore virtual worlds, to feel physically present in distant places, and to have (albeit virtual) experiences that the imagination alone cannot give. Of all the fantasies, EVE: Valkyrie tries to fulfill the one of space travel, starfighter battles, loop-the-loops and pirouettes amid asteroid belts. A competitive online shooter that wants to recreate the exciting chases seen in science fiction films and series, so much so that for the occasion CCP Games has involved Katee Sackhoff, the Starbuck of Battlestar Galactica. We had already told you about Valkyrie a few months ago, on the occasion of the PC debut, but with the arrival of the PlayStation VR version we decided to go back to the cockpit to find out how the Sony viewer behaves and how much the experience has changed thanks to the updates published in the last few months. EVE: Valkyrie is the closest you get to a Battlestar Galactica for PlayStation VR Happy hunting, Valkyries! Despite being a predominantly multiplayer game, Valkyrie takes advantage of the short single tutorial to introduce its narrative premises. Upon awakening in a cloning vat, it is revealed that one's consciousness has been reincarnated into a new body by a military group intent on creating an army of immortal soldiers. Soon, however, players manage to escape with the help of Rn Kavik, the leader of the rebel Valkyrie offshoot. PvE is largely limited to Chronicles, short gathering, recon and assault missions which, while they have been enriched and improved since the PC release to date, are still a secondary part of the experience. The first online deathmatches are slow, a bit awkward, and serve to familiarize yourself with the weapons at your disposal, with the maneuverability of the ship and above all with the particular aiming system. After warming up, however, the game becomes fun: you look for the weakest opponent, you help your teammates, you hide behind an asteroid in an attempt to ambush, you dose turbo and brakes for tight curves , you carry out rapid evasive maneuvers, until you eliminate multiple enemies at once using the main sight for the Gatling gun and that of the visor for the homing missiles. It is at this point that you begin to experiment with the three different types of ships in search of the one that best suits your style: Fighter-type ones are the most versatile, suitable for novices and have a good ratio between speed and firepower; the Heavy fighters are slower but allow you to control the play area thanks to very powerful weapons, multi-target attacks and electromagnetic shields; finally there are the support ships, which as the name suggests are specialized in repairing or buffing teammates. What we didn't expect was to discover how similar the PlayStation 4 version is to the one already available on PC with Oculus Rift. Certainly there will be some difference in effects and texture resolution, but despite the less performing hardware and the less advanced headset, the gaming experience is completely identical. The response to the movements of PlayStation VR is impeccable, allowing you to look around and play without any handicap compared to the PC counterpart, a fundamental element given that the developers' goal is not to benefit anyone in cross-platform challenges. Compared to the version of Valkyrie that we reviewed at the beginning of the year, this PlayStation VR edition also includes the new maps and the two big updates released for the game. The first concerns the Carrier Assault mode, a multi-stage option in which you have to destroy the opposing cargo ship, first taking down its shields, blowing up the weak points and then sneaking into a tunnel that leads to the ship's core, an ending creepy for the new Luke Skywalker. Also included will be the contents of the very recent Joint Strike, the DLC which, in addition to introducing cross-platform matches, interface improvements and a handful of new customizations for your ship, has added a cooperative option to face bots in company of friends, daily challenges to complete and two new single player missions called Recall, more substantial than the first chronicles and more focused on the story and on the characters.", "date": "2016-10-14", "grade": "7.5"}
