{"name": "Capcom Arcade Stadium", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/capcom-arcade-stadium-recensione-raccolta-capcom.html", "text": "Video games seem unable to find an official solution to the issue of historical preservation of titles beyond some commendable initiative by the publishers themselves, as we also see in this review of Capcom Arcade Stadium. The strange situation derives from the particular condition of the video game as a systemic medium, i.e. linked to a specific platform, which, subjected to the process of technological obsolescence, risks disappearing from circulation, taking its entire library with it. This is ironic if you think that video games are also perfectly storable and usable at all times, given their digital essence, at least as long as their source code exists. Capcom Arcade Stadium, the poster is already amarcord Leaving aside the interesting insights on what could be the best system to recover the glories of the past, which would necessarily lead us to consider FPGA systems, however unofficial, the major problem of preservation derives from the thousand legal quibbles that prevent us from considering the emulation as an officially valid system, which makes initiatives by individual companies to re-propose catalogs of the past on the market, as in this case, precious. The problem, of no small importance, is that these selections are necessarily always partial and although they provide, as in Capcom Arcade Stadium, the possibility of expanding the catalog, however they always propose very specific limits and exclude games even of enormous importance, as we can see in this case. The new Capcom collection really does everything well for what it offers, the problem if anything is that it fails to offer everything we would like to see again on the displays of modern platforms, even if great steps forward in this sense have in any case been made compared to previous attempts by part of the same company (between Capcom Generations, Capcom Classics Collection and Capcom Beat'em Up Bundle). A modular selection Capcom Arcade Stadium offers an interesting solution: instead of a fixed catalog, it is a ~modular~ system, which allows you to purchase the titles to play divided into three packages of  14.99 each, each containing ten games and featuring from a certain theme, even if basically it is a normal chronological scan from the 80s to the last 90s. Or it is possible to buy everything in a single solution for the price of  39.99, or in line with the price of other similar collections : for a total of 32 games (Ghosts 'n Goblins free until February 25, the release date of Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection and 1943 The Battle of Midway is instead free for everyone) is a good deal, also considering the way these are repeated. There is a good assortment in each of the three packages, with well-distributed historical titles in all, demonstrating how Capcom has always been a central element in the production of video games, even in the arcade arena. These are games running on original CPS cards, the ~heart~ of the cabinets that housed the Capcom classics, which has evolved over 20 years in different versions and whose different capabilities are clearly visible even among the various collections. We therefore range from Package 1 with ~The Dawn of the Arcades~, containing classics from 1984 to 88, to Package 3 ~The Evolution of the Arcades~, which offers games released between 1992 and 2001, whose graphics are remarkable today again. Truth be told, the beauty of the stylish bitmap like Capcom's is that it stands the test of time head on and still manages to be as perfectly glamorous as it was then, as opposed to most 3D graphics, so pretty much all Capcom Arcade Stadium games are still great to look at and quite a few of them to play as well. Dawn of the Arcade ('84-'88) The Arcade revolution ('89-'92) The evolution of the Arcades ('92-'01) Vulgus striders Warriors of Fate Pirate Ship Higemaru Dynasty Wars Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting 1942 Final Fight Super Street Fighter II Turbo Commando 1941: Counterattack Powered Gear: Strategic Variant Armor Equipment Section Z Senjo no Okami II Cyberbots: Fullmetal Madness Tatakai no Banka Mega Twins 19XX: The War Against Destiny Legendary wings Carrier Air Wing Battle Circuit Bionic Commando Street Fighter II: The World Warrior Giga Wing Forgotten Worlds Captain Commando 1944 The Loop Master Ghouls n Ghosts Varth: Operation Thunderstorm design Virtual game room The peculiarity of Capcom Arcade Stadium is the fact that the games are presented as real cabinets, represented in 3D in a sort of virtual arcade. The setting is built withRE Engine and is realistic, also applying a significant effect to the graphics of the individual games, convincingly simulating the curvature of the original screen and its typical inclination. If you maintain this type of view, you can also turn your gaze and peek at the side cabinets, increasing the feeling of being inside a real games room, with the control panel clearly visible in the lower part. However, the best way to play is probably to use the more standard views with the screen at the center of attention and the ability to apply a variety of filters. There are a total of 7 filters that can be used, proposing different systems of scanlines, gratings, smoothing or doubling of the pixels in order to satisfy all tastes. Sir Arthur has a prominent role in Capcom Arcade Stadium, as the return of Ghosts 'n Goblins to the scene There are also several possibilities to reproduce the curvature of the screen, all systems designed to make the rendering of 2D games as faithful as possible, which were designed to work best on CRT screens and resolutions much lower than the current ones. From the point of view of emulation, an excellent job seems to have been done, deriving on the other hand from years of experience on the reproduction of CPS systems on modern hardware: the games are presented in great shape and substantially identical to the originals, with the possibility of choose between the US ROM and the Japanese one and enriched by the aforementioned numerous display possibilities offered by Capcom, including the possibility of rotating the screen vertically, stretching the image to fill the display or using various frames and interfaces that can be expanded also by unlocking new elements . Multiplayer is provided offline only but there are online leaderboards and an overall scoring system with ~CASPO~ points that allows you to get various rewards. In terms of gameplay, the only comment we feel like making concerns the control system: the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons are not exactly the most suitable tools with which to face challenges of this magnitude (although they have the undoubted advantage of allowing multiplayer ~on the fly~ everywhere), so the advice is to use the Pro Controller or even better a compatible arcade stick, you can feel the difference. Games for all tastes, but with some shortcomings Street Fighter 2 is present in three versions between the original, Hyper Fightin' and Super Speaking of a publisher in business for over 40 years and always on the crest of the wave, it is inevitable that a collection of games released over the decades can only be partial. Capcom Arcade Stadium choices are generally spot on but notable absences are noted, including old classics like Three Wonders, Area 88 (U.N. Squadron), Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, The King of Dragons, Willow, Aliens vs. Predator and even more recent and still current titles such as Darkstalkers, X-Men vs. Street Fighter i Dungeons & Dragons and Knights of the Round, to name a few. In any case, the games present are sufficient to satisfactorily cover the great classic sectors of the arcade: fighting games, shooters and action-platformers, with some of the most seminal games that have been seen for each of the genres in question, and sorry if it is little. Evaluating titles of the genre from a qualitative point of view, nowadays, seems almost inappropriate, since they are real classics, but there are some games that certainly stand out more than others and alone are worth the price of admission. 1942 and other shooters can also be viewed in portrait orientation On the shooter front, the collection really includes a large number of titles such as the 1941-42-44-XX series with a historical fiction setting, among the action ones there is Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Mega Twins, Dynasty Wars while among the fighting games there is the legendary Street Fighter 2 also in the Hyper Fighting and Super versions (and three versions are perhaps even a little redundant), in addition to sci-fi digressions such as Powered Gear and Cyberbots, a mixture of titles that try to range as much as possible between Capcom offers in the arcade and which can offer a large amount of hours of gameplay. They are all great games and moreover playable in different modes and with the possibility of saving the position, the quality of the offer is really high. Pack 2 is perhaps the most balanced in terms of variety of genres and situations, counting milestones such as Street Fighter 2, Strider, Final Fight, Mega Twins and Carrier Air Wing and can be the best introduction for even the less experienced user. but the advice is still to buy all the packages. Strider is herei available in arcade version Beyond the disappointing but inevitable absence of some games, what Capcom Arcade Stadium really lacks above all is the ~encyclopedic~ content, which has become a standard feature of this type of operation and has elevated titles such as SNK 40th Anniversary Collection and Arcade Konami's Classics Anniversary Collection above and beyond a mere collection of re-releases. We are talking about concept art, illustrations, original promotional materials or developer notes that would have further embellished Capcom Arcade Stadium by increasing the nostalgia effect and making us immerse ourselves even more in the magical world of the golden age of arcades. Obviously these are marginal elements with respect to the gameplay, but in a product that in any case relies on historical re-enactment they would have no secondary importance.", "date": "2021-02-22", "grade": "8.4"}
