{"name": "Need for Speed Unbound", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-unbound-recensione.html", "text": "In the last twenty years, starting with Underground 2, Need for Speed has become synonymous with speed races in an open world context: a formula that the Electronic Arts series has generally been able to manage well, combining the typical arcade approach of the franchise to the density of this kind of structure, able to offer a large number of events within freely explorable maps. Over time there have been some interesting variations on the theme, sometimes successful and sometimes less so. In 2019, for example, the Ghost Games guys introduced a little freshness thanks to the idea of day and night races: the first legal ones, designed to collect money; the latter clandestine, useful for making a name for themselves in the scene and at the same time unlocking new events and upgrades to buy, but full of tension due to the risk of being arrested by the police and losing all the money. For its return to the brand, Criterion has seen fit to recover this peculiar concept and at the same time to revolutionize the visual aspect of the game thanks to cartoonish characters in cel shading, a large number of aesthetic customizations and special effects inspired by street art. What came of it? Read on for our Need for Speed Unbound review to find out. History: between betrayals and revenge Need for Speed Unbound, three of the main characters show the cel shading approach If memory serves us well, there are now several editions that Need for Speed basically tells the same story, with a betrayal and the protagonist's desire to get revenge by racing at the base. In this case the story takes place against the backdrop of Lakeshore City, a fictitious city inspired in many ways by Chicago, and the character we're going to create, whether male or female, works together with her friend Jasmine at Rydell's workshop. The trio appears close-knit and there is no doubt that there is something tender between the protagonist and ~Yaz~, but one day the unthinkable occurs: the girl asks us to recover a car on behalf of an old flame of hers, but once we arrive at the delivery site, we discover that it was only a diversion to ensure that Rydell's garage remained unattended, so that a group of criminals could plunder it and steal all the racing cars present. Jasmine initially denies having been involved in the heist, but then drives off in our character's car, leaving her two (former) friends in despair. Two years go by, the workshop somehow gets back on track and the arrival of an exuberant businesswoman, Tess, allows us to go back to racing... all the more so since it is Yaz who organizes the races together with his new companions and we have more than one reason to defeat it and recover our car. The narrative outline of Need for Speed Unbound therefore retraces a path already widely traveled by the series and does so in an apparently devoid of particular cues, which already suggests in the early hours where it will go away at the end of the campaign. Luckily the dialogues keep the experience afloat, given that they are brilliantly written and have the merit of characterizing our character, the crazy Tess and Rydell, very well, thanks also to a really well done Italian dubbing, which will not be missing to make you smile. Structure: an all too traditional open world Need for Speed Unbound, a daytime race We said at the beginning that the open world approach is now an aspect that is taken almost for granted when approaching an episode of Need for Speed, and from this point of view Unbound is no exception, even if it doesn't shine in terms of innovation. The Lakeshore City map is fairly large and can offer suggestive panoramas, but in reality you will spend your time moving from point A to point B to participate in a race or to return to one of the available shelters, without however the possibility of resort to fast travel. The sensation is that of a scenario that is beautiful to look at but fundamentally arid, and that's a great pity. character, changing the hairstyle and hair color or buying new clothing items based on really existing brands, all decidedly ~urban~ in terms of style between bomber jackets, sneakers and sweatpants; or modify the car from an aesthetic and performance point of view, or buy a new one (the fleet of cars is quite rich but not boundless). Owning several vehicles can of course be useful for participating in events limited to specific categories and indexesperformance. Need for Speed Unbound, the car upgrade system Entering a shelter will also allow us to go from day to night: as we explained in the Need for Speed Heat review, the two different moments imply the possibility of participating in different challenges and, in the case of night races, earning much more money which, however, we can risk losing since the police will be more present and ready to chase us. However, the tension of the aforementioned Heat is only a distant memory: we will have to be really unlucky and / or unable to get caught by the police, which highlights a clear difficulty balancing problem. Tuning in Need for Speed Unbound appears very rich, in all respects, and it could not be otherwise considering the tradition of the series: we will be able to revolutionize the design of the car, add lights and sounds, change the special effects displayed when we drift and jump, but also replace various mechanical components to upgrade the vehicle and make it more competitive. Access to the most advanced upgrades, however, will be linked to the improvement of the workshop and it will take a lot of good money to do it. Need for Speed Unbound, a night race To collect them we will obviously have to participate in the tenders visible on the map, often paying a registration fee and therefore risking not getting the desired return, especially because at the intermediate difficulty level the Criterion title turns out to be quite difficult and characterized by an ~elastic effect~ rather marked and frustrating, which can translate into literally losing the race at the last corner due to a single, unfortunate carelessness. Once we decide that we will participate in the Grand, the legendary tournament organized in this case by our old friend Jasmine, the structure of Unbound goes from a series of random events to weekly qualifiers with very specific objectives and different stipulations (which include the Relay mode, based on the score of the stunts maneuvers), with also the obligation to collect a certain amount of money to be able to pay the registration for the final confrontation, which takes place in the context of various elimination competitions. Gameplay: color drift Need for Speed Unbound delivery missions will allow us to drive different cars On the gameplay side, Need for Speed Unbound clearly proposes the arcade approach that has always been prevalent for the EA series, albeit with some differences from the aforementioned Heat. The drift is in fact still essential to be able to go through the hairpin bends at speed, but it tends to leave little control or to slip too much (unless you slow down or use the nitro to exit the curve, recovering grip), and at that point they come into play unpleasant obstacles, which in the episode developed by Ghost Games generally did not arise. Mind you: the environmental destructibility is still very high and the Frostbite graphics engine manages the disintegration of guardrails, poles, fences and so on with great ease while we cross them with the car, but the cars belonging to the traffic and some walls often appear on our road, triggering an impact that can slow us down to the point of making us overtake by one or more opponents and losing the race, also and above all due to the effect elastic we have already mentioned: when it happens it is very frustrating. Need for Speed Unbound boasts an open world that is very nice to look at Returning to the drifts, together with the jumps they are among the acrobatic maneuvers of the game and as such they can count on special effects that refer to the aesthetics of graffiti and which embellish our car, drawing wings and circles around it, or producing a colored smoke: all aspects that we will be able to modify through the editor present inside the shelters, the same one that allows you to mount new components to improve performance. In short, on the customization front, a good job has been done. The biggest problem we encountered concerns the attractiveness of the experience, in the sense that the system of alternating between day and night in Unbound was implemented in a vague and poorly convinced with respect to Heat, also due to the chases with the police rendered in a trivial and inconsistent way, while the types of races available are fairly varied but have already been seen. In short, a valid and concrete reason is not provided to dissect the offer, and so we simply find ourselves opting for the events that guarantee the greatest profit (with the extra of bets against individual opponents, if you want) to proceed more quickly in the countryside. The multiplayer mode Needfor Speed Unbound includes a multiplayer mode that can be accessed from the main menu and has a separate progression from the campaign. We will therefore be asked to create a character again and choose one of three starting cars, but we will immediately have a decent nest egg available ($150,000) to be able to upgrade the vehicle or buy another one, become competitive and participate in the available events together with the others users on our own server. The system works and we have not noticed any problems, but we are talking about an online experience that is not integrated into the main system, conceptually a bit dated. Technical implementation: a controversial approach Need for Speed, the character we created poses showing the biceps So let's come to the technical sector of the game, which as you know is undoubtedly characterized by an original and unexpected style: the characters are made in cel shading and our performances on the street are accompanied by the ~designed~ visual effects we talked about a moment ago. but the cars and scenarios instead have ~normal~ graphics, tending towards realism. Predictable concessions for a driving game with real cars, but underlining a certain lack of courage: why not apply cel shading to the whole game? Maliciously, we could deduce that this choice is due to the possibility of recycling certain assets from previous episodes. The mix that comes out is bizarre but all in all pleasant, and the vehicle models can count on an excellent level of detail, as well as a convincing effects as regards the drops of water on the bodywork, the reflections (which however seem to be simple cubemaps) and even the (purely visual) rendering of the damage. The scenarios boast truly remarkable views, enhanced by an excellent lighting system (both day and night), intensive use of screen space reflection on puddles and good rendering of weather effects. Need for Speed Unbound allows you to customize the smoke from drifting Everything nominally moves at 4K and 60 fps on PS5, with few uncertainties but some popup phenomenon on the distance which makes us understand why this episode has not also landed on PS4 and Xbox One: the previous generation consoles would not have it made to guarantee a punctual streaming of the assets, which is obviously fundamental for a racer. Is Frostbite the best choice for a similar production? We are not yet fully convinced. On the one hand, the audio sector can count on a signed soundtrack that adapts very well to the atmosphere of Lakeshore City, while referring to specific genres (there is a lot of trap) and without allowing the classic track selection. We have already talked about dubbing in Italian: it is undoubtedly an added value, which by now should not be taken for granted and which in this case manages to give depth and fun to the dialogues. A great job, too bad there are entire sequences (see the ones with ASAP Rocky) that have remained inexplicably in English.", "date": "2022-12-03", "grade": "7.0"}
