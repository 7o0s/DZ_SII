It's the real world that doesn't forgive with its rules, unlike the video game world where even a revolt can become something cute and cuddly. The case we are talking about is that of Anarcute, a title created by the French studio Anarteam. Before going to discover Anarcute in more detail, it is necessary to know that the project was born within the French video game school Supinfogame, and for this reason it is even more interesting given its quality. It is in fact the fruit of the work of five people, born as a ~task~ in 2013 to collect some prizes in the indie environment already during its development, before landing on PC and Xbox One. The cuddly call of the protagonists of Anarcute also led us to help them in their revolt: here's how it went. Cute and cuddly, cute and cuddly: the Anarcute revolution has arrived! Never make a pug angry The premise of Anarcute sees a world controlled by a group of evil companies, now in possession of the most important cities in the world. Thanks to the use of the media, the police forces have been brainwashed and dominate entire neighborhoods under the banner of the so-called Brainwash Patrol. Little by little, the latter is conquering all the inhabited centers of the Earth, but fortunately there is a handful of heroes who, starting from Tokyo, begin to counter this oppression. To compose the group of rioters, however, we do not find human beings marked by a thousand battles, but animals of various species and breeds with an anthropomorphic shape. Rabbits, crocodiles, pigeons, pugs and even carp take to the streets to say enough to the Brainwash Patrol, against the backdrop of four world cities adapted in a colorful key to the nature of Anarcute. Already starting from its name, the result of the fusion between the words anarchy and adorable in English, Anarteam's work presents the contrast between a ~Pikmin-style~ style and a serious theme such as revolution as its workhorse. But be careful not to underestimate it, because apart from the cuddliness of its protagonists Anarcute is a full-fledged revolt simulator, complete with streets set on fire, buildings stormed and fires set here and there. The dynamics of Anarcute are essentially those of an action game, with some element of strategy necessary especially at advanced levels to be able to successfully complete the objectives. The player is put in control of an entire rioting crowd, represented as a single entity and therefore indivisible in its composition. The game over in each level comes when you go towards the extinction of the group of rioters, whose number of components is therefore essential to be able to move forward in your business. In reality it is for more than one reason, because by joining other members in the protest it is possible to obtain a series of special abilities to use during the level. By increasing the crowd, for example, it becomes possible to knock down buildings on which snipers are located, or to count on a greater speed of movement to facilitate our task. At the end of each level, tokens are also obtained, to be invested between one mission and another to further enrich the group of rioters with particular skills. Good first In terms of pure gameplay, Anarcute's release from a school project appears quite evident, testifying to the fact that a well-made video game is by no means something that can be improvised. Putting aside more general speeches that do not directly concern the work of the five French students, we find an extremely fun game to play, immediate in being able to manage the group in revolt but difficult at the right point over time. As we have already mentioned, during the first levels the player is asked a few times to stop and think, thus allowing him to dive into the fray without particularly worrying. Already starting from the second city (Paris) things get a little more complicated, forcing him to consider the alternatives to launch an attack in order not to risk ending up defeated. The introduction of various types of enemies contributes to this, from the aforementioned snipers to other armored units that do area damage, passing through bombers and more. If you already have to stop and evaluate your strategy during the levels, the same need obviously also arises in the case of the final bosses, present in each area. Moving on to the negatives, where Anarcute faces some criticism is longevity. Once completeeta the various levels there are no particular reasons to go back to it, if not for perfection freaks who intend to improve their performance. In fact, each mission is evaluated based on the total time taken to complete it, eliminated opponents and crowd size. Since multiplayer doesn't even exist locally, seeing some other city alongside the four present would have been the only way to lengthen the time needed to complete Anarcute, quantifiable in about four hours with an interval due to the player's skill. Even from a narrative point of view a little more could have been done, giving the revolt of our nice protagonists one more reason to be remembered. Color riot We have already had the opportunity to talk about the particular style of Anarcute, since it is undoubtedly the main distinctive aspect of this title. However, it is worth spending a few more words on the artistic work put in place by the Anarteam guys, which leaves us quite satisfied. While sharing a lot in terms of gameplay, the cities are shown to us well in their diversity, allowing the crowd to use elements that belong to the different urban furniture. The Eiffel Tower itself is brought into play as the Brainwash Patrol's Parisian stronghold, taken over and destroyed by the rioting pets. The latter present diversity only from an aesthetic point of view, allowing us to customize the species that make up our group: seeing a group of anthropomorphic mussels turn an entire neighborhood upside down is priceless. We also point out some quite nice cutscenes, which take up the style of the game to show us the members of the Brainwash Patrol as they beat a retreat. Before concluding, we also mention the soundtrack among the positive aspects, designed to make the cuddly aspect of Anarcute even more evident. The various songs will have no difficulty getting into your head, accompanying you even when you are not in front of the screen to free Miami or Tokyo. Ah, if you intend to play on PC make sure you have a pad available, since the combination of mouse and keyboard in this case is not advisable.", "date": "2016-07-25", "grade": "7.8"}
