Now however, if they fall into a precipice, the same princes are taken by the hand and gently brought back to the edge: may they never die. If you find this scenario depressing, VVVVVV will put a blissful smile like Captain Viridian's on your faces. Don't let its looks fool you though: VVVVVV looks like a retro game, but it's a very current 2D platformer. First of all, it is played with the arrow keys and a single button; more modern than that. Instead, the twisted and diabolical level design makes us sweat. And to think that everything was going smoothly for the captain and his crew of five, each with a name starting with V. Together they were flying happily through space when, suddenly, an anomaly scattered them to the four corners of a very special space station. Inside, in fact, it is possible to reverse the force of gravity. On this discovery, the film ends and Terry Cavanagh's game begins, which can be purchased at this address for less than eleven euros or can be tested in demo here. I'm looking for a permanent center of gravity We said that the keyboard arrows are used to move the captain: to these is added a key capable of overturning the force of gravity, so that you can walk on what was the ceiling up to a second before. Each screen, while seamlessly linked to the next, actually represents a ~room~ in the game, designed to be potentially lethal. Inside these ~rooms~ you will have to solve puzzles using the inversion of gravity to your advantage. However, things are not always so linear. In one section of the base the screen slides upwards, pressing on you with sharp points. In other cases there are elastic lines that cause the captain to bounce, and so on from one devilry to another. Only outer space, black and flat, is without threat. Of course you will die: all right if you die. In fact, the action is frenetic, in some cases psychedelic, due to the geometric shapes that alternate on the backdrop. Thankfully, before and after each puzzle, there are checkpoints that instantly save your location. This gimmick, combined with the ingenious architecture of the base, prevents any regurgitation of frustration. Dying twenty times in a row in one minute doesn't detract from the instant fun of VVVVVV. Believe us, Captain Viridian's seraphic expression will infect you without even realizing it. ^___^ The success of VVVVVV depends on several factors. The most obvious is the arrangement of the checkpoints, but soon you notice other elements that make it a 2010 game in all respects. First of all decent plot and dialogues; to follow the hypnotic music, and finally the map that can be consulted. But these factors would be confetti without a varied game design that never asks the player to do the same thing twice. Without forgetting that each room has a suggestive name. The honors in this case go to Bennet Foddy, who has done his job admirably: text and visual work together to fill the gaps left by the technique and stimulate the imagination. Too bad only for the controls: in fact, if you rely on the keyboard, you have to take into account fifty additional deaths. Everything else, however, runs smoothly. Maybe even too much, since it only takes a few hours to complete the game. Unless you want to collect all the bonuses, in which case, good luck. And don't forget to smile.", "date": "2010-02-19", "grade": "8.2"}
