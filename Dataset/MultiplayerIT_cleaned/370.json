Are you tired of clearing the rooms of the Oldest House in Control anymore? Are your pockets full of Devil May Cry 5 demons? Banana Bird (better to overlook the Italian translation) has what it could do for you: an ethology simulator. Said like this it might seem almost disturbing, instead Beasts Of Maravilla Island is a real hymn to relaxation and meditation. Let's find out how the small Californian development team did it in our review of Beasts Of Maravilla Island. On the edge of the world Beasts Of Maravilla Island ...is Maravilla Island, an imaginary island towards which Marina, the young protagonist of the title, is heading. In this strip of land, discovered several years earlier by grandfather Vasco, live incredible creatures, such as flying monkeys or the feline otter, which however risk disappearing, because no one, believing in their existence, is willing to take care of them. Miss Montez therefore decides to retrace her grandfather's footsteps armed only with a camera, determined both to discover the origins of the gem set in the cover of the diary bequeathed to her, and to complete all the research left unfinished by her ancestor (photograph the fauna and flora of a certain location, shooting animals in certain attitudes and so on). These last tasks, together with other useful information on the surrounding habitat, are contained in the aforementioned diary, but their completion is completely optional and leads exclusively to the unlocking of achievements, having no impact on the endgame. The structure is basic and recalls that of NUTS, a similar title that we tried some time ago, with the difference that in Beasts of Maravilla Island backtracking is reduced to a minimum. In essence, it is a question of proceeding along the only available path (although the invisible walls blend well with the flora), solving very simple mini puzzles to open the way to the next area. Marina's only ~weapon~, which is controlled in the third person, is the aforementioned camera, whose flash can have an effect on certain types of particularly photosensitive plants. For most of the time, however, it is used in the most orthodox way, i.e. to capture the colorful animals that inhabit the island on film. A maximum of twenty photos can be taken for each subject (if you take more, you have to delete those already saved); the counter naturally helps to understand whether the shot is new or not. Marina can neither run nor jump, which makes the levels rather linear; however, it can hiss and sneak up to approach creatures without scaring them for more detailed photos. Poor art The artistic direction of the Banana Bird game is full of interesting ideas: although it is not easy to invent an ecosystem starting from a blank sheet (and in fact not all plants and animals are recreated with the same originality), the visual rendering returns a world harmonious and rich in color, but certainly not in detail. The Unity engine doesn't lend itself to churning out models full of high-definition polygons and textures, and for these reasons the choice to adopt the so-called ~low poly vector~ graphic style seems intelligent and functional to us. Furthermore, the low system requirements allow Beasts Of Maravilla Island to be managed in maximum detail even by a low-power console like Nintendo Switch, a platform in which it finds its natural habitat following in the footsteps of a blockbuster like New Pokemon Snap . The soundtrack, dominated by tropical instruments, is relaxing and constantly makes its presence felt, adapting to the rhythmic rhythms of the adventure, while the environmental effects are composed mainly of chirps. Apart from the initial and final sequences (in English) there is no actual speech: the only human being, Marina, emits onomatopoeic sounds which indicate surprise or disappointment. Italian is among the languages supported in written texts. We have to report some small bugs (protagonist getting stuck between the polygons, some ~freezes~ during loading) which, in such a small production, are more difficult to tolerate. Completing the journey to the island of wonderful beasts won't take more than an hour and a half (even less if you don't want to get all the achievements); add to this the beauty of ten minutes of final credits, an exaggeration worthy of Ubisoft's blockbusters.", "date": "2021-06-21", "grade": "6.0"}
