Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. What kind of title is ~Crazy Punishment~? More than legitimate question. The game, developed by the small Japanese team hap, is originally called ~Crazy Freekick~ but arrived on the App Store and Google Play with a decidedly unfortunate translation. Beyond this, we are certainly dealing with an out of the ordinary product, one of those videogame madnesses for which Japanese developers are often famous. The concept behind the experience is in fact very simple: we control a player about to take a free-kick from the edge, determining the shot through a touch mechanism similar to that of the classic Angry Birds, with the aim of putting the ball into the net trying to overcome the defense. The point is how this defense looks, and that's where the fun begins. If you were expecting a traditional barrier formed by the defenders of the opposing team, you are very wrong because, within the twelve levels, each made up of four challenges, we will have to overcome obstacles of all kinds: from ninjas who disguise themselves - trying to make themselves invisible - to sumo wrestlers, from animals walking around the course to surprise golf holes, from running trains to optical illusions. There are even quotes, given that in some levels we will even deal with Gundam and Predator! Punizione Pazzo is a fun and different game, full of absurd situations but too short Crazy pig In short, the charm of Punizione Pazzo lies in its madness, in the quotations, in the absolutely improbable solutions that follow one another on the screen to create a new challenge every time. Overcoming difficulties often turns out to be a matter of intuition, sometimes timing and precision, or even sheer luck. The three ~lives~ available to us are consumed with each failed attempt, but after we have come across the game over we will still be able to restart the game from the last level reached. And this is, unfortunately, the biggest limitation of the game, beyond a deliberately basic and sketchy technical realization, as per tradition for this kind of title. In fact, if forty-eight stages may seem like a lot on paper, completing them is almost always a matter of a few seconds: just the time to solve the ~puzzle~, calibrate the shot and bag it. It goes without saying that in this way the experience runs out in just ten minutes, just like it happened to us, sending us back to a website that simply says that new levels will arrive. The unlocking of the endless mode, which should have its value in terms of duration, unfortunately in this specific case does not add much to the package, given that the challenges are exactly the same as we have already overcome in the campaign and which, once ~solved~ , do not present the same degree of difficulty, on the contrary they are completed in fluency. Probably focusing on a hardcore approach, with a ~dry match~ and three lives, thus forcing users to start all over again in game over, would have made the entertainment offered by Punizione Pazzo last longer, which however should be tried for gimmicks absurd and totally free.", "date": "2014-03-29", "grade": "7.0"}
