Driven by the novelty and solid production qualities, players were drawn to the servers, posting strong sales from the very first days and allowing DICE to catch up on the still unattainable Call of Duty. The two productions have now taken very different paths, offering diametrically opposite experiences, but there is one thing on which they still seem unable to detach themselves: post-launch support. In fact, after They Shall Not Pass here comes a new massive package to flesh out the contents of Battlefield 1, in an attempt to keep the community alive and bring additions to an already very full-bodied title. Let's find out together what will change for the veterans and what the new recruits will find on the servers from today on. In the coldest Russia The latest expansion pack focuses on the Russian military and brings with it a good amount of new content. In fact, there are many weapons added and six new maps: Lupkow Pass, Albion, Galicia, Brusilov Keep, Tsaritsyn and Volga. The DLC also introduces, for the first time, female soldiers under the Russian Red Army, an admirable addition based on the well-known Death Battalion. Each of the locations mentioned so far is unique and particular enough to leave its mark on the title, differing significantly from those seen in the basic version. The maps are much more open, perfect for sniping, and are studded with cover, barricades and trenches, which you can use to get close to control points without getting killed in a sensational way. The greater breadth of the maps has also been designed to favor the new spears supplied by the cavalry, very fun to use and with a great scenic impact even if unfortunately not as effective as the old swords. The freezing cold of the Russian winter is obviously conveyed through maps covered in a thick blanket of snow, frozen streams and a constant snowfall. DICE certainly could not leave aside new vehicles and here then appear on the horizon a new bomber and a new ship for landings to be used as an arrowhead, to be used for respawns and as a fixed base. There is also a new armored car with a double position, with smoke bombs and a rear cannon that requires you to turn 180 every time you decide to fire. The Behemoth train also reappears on Brusilov Keep, for one of the best maps in the entire pack. The gameplay is fast and frenetic and there is no shortage of hand-to-hand clashes as well as those over distance, for a location that is very close to perfection. Tsaritsyn instead tries to offer something different and more personal, putting only three control points on the plate in a map specifically designed for chaotic clashes. The cathedral placed in the middle of the location is surrounded by trenches and barbed wire, making it almost impossible to predict where the enemies will come from from time to time and consequently increasing the tension in the player. Two maps placed at the extremes of a very varied and complete offer. New modes and operations It's not only the new maps that make a good impression but also the new mode called Supply Drop manages to be particularly entertaining. Essentially the play area will be flown over by support aircraft that will drop supply crates at random points and the player will be required to gain control assisted by his team. It's definitely not a mode that will keep you busy for long but it's still a good distraction from the usual routine, a bit like War Pigeons was at launch. Also accompanying this mode are two new Operations: The Brusilov Offensive sees both sides battle the Russian countryside in Galicia in a large-scale battle for 40 or 64 players. The first operation can be problematic for the Russian forces, with an open space to face: you will encounter small areas of cover, forcing you to always adopt very dangerous outflanking tactics. The second operation, Red Tide, represents the struggle between the Communist Red Army and the Tsarist White Army during the Russian Revolution. Taking place after the war in 1919, he sees the two factions clash violently, spilling blood on their own homeland. Starting on the Volga River, in one of the largest maps to date, the Red Army will assault a snow-covered countryside, with the city of Tsaritsyn in the distance ready to welcome the final stages of this epic confrontation. DICE has also listened carefully to the community, reworking the systema of rewards and brought the specializations back within the brand. Available for classes and vehicles, this feature last appeared in Battlefield 4 and allows you to choose perks that improve defense, add movement bonuses or reduce the effects of suppression, just to name the first that come to mind. Some of these bonuses are specific to certain classes and we can only recommend that you experiment and try them out yourself to find the combinations that best suit your style of play.", "date": "2017-10-15", "grade": "8.5"}
