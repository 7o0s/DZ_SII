{"name": "Bullet Witch - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bullet-witch-recensione.html", "text": "Magical Powers The moves available to Alicia are not many. She can perform a jump / somersault to get out of the most awkward situations and a blow in close combat, which allows her to throw that kind of giant cannon that she carries over her shoulder with different results, depending on the proximity of the enemies. Most of the time, however, our heroine does nothing but run around the levels shooting like hell, without any concern for the ammo that reloads with a pinch of magic, which accumulates quite quickly. The rifle has two basic configurations, one like a machine gun and one like a real cannon, which fires only one shot at a time, but with more power. Among other things, it is also possible to zoom to a closer view which allows greater power, but which slows down the movements of the witch, exposing her to too many risks. Then, of course, there are the spells, which Alicia can cast at any time, mana permitting, and which, like the shotgun, can be upgraded using the skill points you gain as you progress through the different levels. They range from a simple protective wall, to a meteor shower that literally devastates the seabed, causing it to explode into a thousand pieces with disruptive results. The real problem is that almost all of the enemies encountered in Bullet Witch are simple soldiers who are easily eliminated with a rifle, leaving the task of solving specific situations to the spells, with almost no possibility of inventiveness for the player, who slowly forget you have them on hand. In short, the idea behind the spells and their implementation is not bad, but their use is too limited and does not allow almost any initiative, leaving them the functionality of choreographic smart bombs, to be used in cases of extreme difficulty, without any effect on the actual game play. The only exception is perhaps the telekinetic power of the Will, which allows you to hurl cars and rocks at zombies and which comes in handy whenever you want to try to eliminate multiple enemies together, but it's a bit small, compared to what you could have gotten... The design of a witch The first levels of Bullet Witch are simply urban areas delimited by force barriers, created by the Testa Noce, or flying brains, who try to prevent us from continuing on the path. Once eliminated, the barriers disappear and you can go on until the next one, killing zombies and some other eccentric creatures, having fun interacting with the many elements of the seabed that can be destroyed and thrown around. Things slowly improve with some areas in wooded areas that also develop vertically, which however never manage to completely clear the field of the limits of an approximate artificial intelligence of the enemies and which finds it difficult to get the action off the ground. The real problem is that BW is a really short game, which can be completed in less than 6 hours, if it weren't for the really challenging final boss fight. Once the game is over, you can replay the individual levels, trying to improve and then submit your scores to the online leaderboards via Xbox Live. There is no mode in Versus, much less co-op and both would have helped Alicia score some more points. Sinuous like a spell Bullet Witch, at least from a technical point of view, manages to do some things so well, if not to amaze, at least to surprise the player in a couple of moments. Some spells, such as the tornado, allow you to shatter entire portions of the seabed, throwing them into the air to then make them fall back to the ground in an explosion of elements, all governed by the physics applied to each of them. The biggest problem, in addition to the lack of variety in the enemies, which are very few, is, again, the brevity that leads Alicia to go through six levels, two of which are the same repeated, with very small variations. Textures are defined, but shadows are wobbly; some bosses are huge, but blandly animated. In short, for every positive aspect there is at least one that is not convincing, in this department as in the others, and the whole thing, unfortunately, remains covered by a patina of poor care that demeans the interesting ideas that are also present. Even the audio sector follows the same fate with some discrete level tracks, alternating with others that are not exactly brilliant. Here as elsewhere, however, one cannot fail to recognize Bullet Witch a personality of its own. Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, this essentially depends on the tastes of those who decide to try their hand at the adventures of this so sensual witch. Goals 360 THE1000 points of Bullet Witch will make you sweat enough. In fact, to get just over 200, it is enough to finish the game even at a normal level, but to collect the others you have to replay everything on three other difficulty settings, maximize Alicia's power-ups and play at least 15 actual hours. Comment Bullet Witch will perhaps please all those who long to see their Xbox 360 invaded by titles full of that style and that taste, for us sometimes a little over the top, with which only Japanese developers are able to conceive and implement a project. These players, perhaps, will be able to go beyond the aesthetic and design limits of a very short game that fails to convincingly develop some of the ideas, albeit interesting, that can be glimpsed in some moments. Those who were hoping to read this review and find the birth of a sleeper hit or a solid action game, however, are strongly advised to try Bullet Witch before purchasing. The Cavia game is definitely not for everyone. Pros: Alicia The interactivity of the backdrops Cons: Artificial intelligence Level design Longevity Magic and bullets, a decidedly unusual combination, especially if the protagonist is a beautiful girl named Alicia. A witch with lethal powers who fights alone against an army of Zombies resurrected by demonic forces, landed in our dimension thanks to a mysterious portal, bringing destruction and death. Bullet Witch is a third-person action shooter, developed by Cavia for the Japanese market, and which is also brought by Atari to the shelves throughout Europe, after a long period in which the programmers have tried to remedy the criticisms that had been moves to the original code. The definitive game is now available to anyone who wants to venture into this kitsch and a little crazy world, with some interesting ideas, but which overall will not be able to convince those who are not really passionate about Japan Style games.", "date": "2007-03-28", "grade": null}
