Finally, the decimanon expansion of World of Warcraft, Blood of the Blimb-min-klia, had been published, which introduced the Petomanal race, a breed of petomaniac ferrets with skills focused on aerophagia and meteorism, and which finally took away from the players the 'incumbency to do anything, leaving him the burden of quickly pressing a couple of keys repeatedly to move forward in the game. A godsend. The world was still in crisis, despite a couple of world-wide wars and the doubling of the annual edition of Big Brother, with the possibility for the public to virtually mate with their favorite character via Apple's iCiul peripheral. A big bundle. In short, everyone was there dreaming the dreams they had to dream, when at one point they found themselves with water inside the house and burnt skin. The usual seasonal flood? So thought a pensioner from Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, or at least she thought so until, turning on the television, she found all the channels skipped. Being an early Facebook user, she turned on her 4D smartphone, only to find to her horror that there was no network left and she could no longer ask anyone what was going on. Even the traditional telephone lines were down. Was it possible that the politicians had lied to her and that the situation was more serious than they declared on the talk shows? Alone, without a television broadcast or an updated status that would tell her how to live, the old lady let herself drown when she realized that the water would not recede and that her pension would no longer be of any use. Old pessimist. Old structure makes good broth Year 2070. The old one is still dead, but we have finally been able to play with the new chapter of one of the longest running strategy series on the market. Those who know the old episodes, even though set in more or less remote historical periods, will find themselves at home. The game is always the same: you have to colonize territories starting from basic agglomerations, collecting or exchanging the available resources with other players, human or guided by the CPU. Each building among those available costs resources, but allows you to accumulate others, often in concert with different structures. Obviously the difficulty lies in building without exaggerating, that is, in making sure that what is spent is used to produce and not to waste what one has. Building thoughtlessly will lead to immediate poverty, making it difficult (if not impossible) to move forward and make your civilization flourish. It will therefore be important to build residential areas to increase the population and industrial areas to make it work. Unlike other games where you operate on large territories, Anno 2070's maps are divided into islands. Nothing shocking, but you too will understand that the type of terrain, particularly ~wet~, forces you to consider the water element in particular, which becomes central to the final victory. Depending on the faction chosen, one more environmentalist, one more industrialized, it will be possible to build different economic structures capable of exploiting the seabed, so as not to leave it unproductive. Building underwater costs a lot in terms of resources, but it's worth it. Unfortunately it is not possible to create underwater cities. No, no Rapture. Once civilization has been brought to a higher level, it will be possible to build special buildings that will characterize it more. Unlimited growth One of the best elements of Anno 2070 is the specialization of the workforce. Citizens will start out as general workers and live in small buildings. As buildings increase and population grows, the workforce will specialize (via a system of skill points), producing more, but also driving up costs. From the point of view of cuts, Blue Byte has practically canceled the time dedicated to the transport of goods, making them immediately available in all warehouses on the island. If we think how important this factor was in a game like The Settlers 7, also by Blue Byte, you will understand that the focus is clearly elsewhere. Obviously there is no shortage of important sectors such as research, trade and diplomacy, which allow you to obtain new buildings and new resources to further grow the islands. Slowly you find yourself with a gigantic civilization to manage, which requires attention in several points. Fortunately, the growth process is quite slow and it is possible to practice the game without suddenly finding yourself in a panic of too many things to do. Regular players of the series will find themselves at home as soon as they get used to the new scenario, while new players will have no major difficultiescultivate thanks to the tutorial and the related assistance you receive to perform basic actions, especially in the campaign. The two factions... or three? Obviously, in addition to the possibility of freely colonizing islands, other modes are available. The most important is the classic campaign formed by a chain of missions. This is an interesting mode, even if the fundamentalists of the genre will prefer the free one, in which we will go further into the background of the game, following a story that explores the post-catastrophe relationship between the two factions on a global level. Actually, if you understand how the game works, there isn't much to say. The various missions require the completion of certain objectives to continue. The objectives follow a precise evolution and are well structured, but they are not particularly original compared to the old episodes of the series and, above all, they are very easy to achieve, especially in the first two chapters (out of three). But after all, originality is now a utopia, so there's no need to penalize Anno 2070 too much because it incorporates winning formulas from the past. Let's say that after a few hours you will complete it and finally you will be able to dedicate yourself with a free mind to the other modalities, much more long-lived and exciting. The differentiation between the two factions revolves around the biggest novelty introduced by Blue Byte in Year 2070, global warming. In summary, the industrial faction looks only at economic growth regardless of pollution, with the defect of destroying the environment in a rapid and often dramatic way, creating counterproductive imbalances for its own economy. On the other hand, the ecological faction lives in greater harmony with nature, but has slower growth and the morale of its population is more influenced by the conditions of the territory. Both factions have their own ways of fighting pollution, with the industrial faction betting everything on recycling plants, while the eco-friendly faction on constructing environmentally friendly buildings that create a livable environment that is also pleasant to look at. In reality there is also a third faction, the S.A.A.T., which must be unlocked during the campaign or in the scenarios. It is all about science and gives access to advanced technologies to the other two factions. It must be managed in a very particular way, because it requires the use of different resources from the other factions and in order to develop it, an entire island must be dedicated to the production of technology.", "date": "2011-12-05", "grade": "8.9"}
