We have seen it repeatedly, we have played it on many occasions between events, fairs and beta versions but it had not yet been possible for us to get the complete picture, fully understand how attractive it could be to the general public. And now that we have played it for many hours in its final version, the time has come to evaluate how much good there is in this original and audacious project born from the fervent mind of the same developers who created Left 4 Dead many years ago: the boys by Turtle Rock Studios. But let's start with the basics. Evolve is a first-person shooter with a very strong, not to mention exclusive, multiplayer component where four hunters, controlled by the players, have to deal with a monster, also controlled by a human, within rather vast maps, covered with vegetation , rocks and buildings and with a great vertical development. Basically, the objective of the two factions is quite simple and opposite: the hunters must find the monster by following its tracks and killing it before it becomes too powerful; the animal, on the other hand, must feed on the local fauna in order to evolve through two stages and thus be ready to fight the hunters. In reality, the advanced gameplay of Evolve is much more multifaceted and profound in its attempt to combine cooperative mechanics with competitive ones. Evolve can be fun and addictive but lacks in a couple of aspects related to its gameplay Additional content galore Evolve will be supported with a pretty aggressive DLC schedule. First of all, depending on the pre-order made, you will have access to different aesthetic packs related to weapons and monster skins. Upgrades that can also be purchased in-game, through the shop implemented in the main menu and which can give rise to spending sprees that have generated more than a few online criticisms. Those who pre-ordered the game will also have access to the previously announced fourth monster, the Behemoth, when it is released in the spring, while those who purchased the Hunter Season Pass will have access to four new hunters, one for each class, as soon as they become available on the market. Finally there's the PC Monster Race edition, exclusive to computers, which contains a fifth unannounced monster and a series of unreleased skins for the other animals. Turtle Rock has then announced on several occasions that the new maps and game modes will always be released free of charge to avoid separating and dispersing players. Don't just call them hunters Let's start with the hunters, the custodians of cooperative mechanics. The base game contains three of each of the four classes, in an attempt to offer a number of variations on some rather basic gameplay mechanics. It starts with the trapper, a sort of natural leader of the group given that among his peculiar skills we find the possibility of tracking down the monster through a series of gadgets or, in the case of Maggie, the first exponent of this class that we will have available, with the help of a pet capable of sniffing out the animal. Let's say it right away that the player at the controls of the trapper is often the balance of the entire match: if particularly skilled, he is able to catch the monstrous opponent in the very first minutes and make the outcome of the match turn heavily in favor of the hunters . Then there is the assaulter: the tank capable of doing damage too. It is usually equipped with two weapons, one for close combat and one for ranged combat, and a short-lived personal shield capable of blocking any super attacks from the monster. It's arguably the simplest and most straightforward class in the whole package - just shoot in hopes of getting the enemy to target you. Then it's up to the support, a very heterogeneous class in its three exponents. Basically he must try to support, in the true sense of the word, the rest of the team through momentary boosts, the possibility of hiding the team, or with a comfortable portable shield that he can project for a limited time on any of the other characters. Finally we find the inevitable doctor. Also in this case we pass from more obvious cures such as Val's inevitable healing pistol to more refined mechanics such as in the case of Caira who has grenades capable of area healing or Lazarus who can only quickly resurrect his companions without activating the death penalty. Precisely this last aspect puts us in front of a basic mechanic of Evolve that players must always keep in mind. When a character is mortally wounded, he has the classic few seconds of extra life that his companions canono exploit to try to resurrect it on the fly. However, when a character reaches his third ~apparent~ death, he loses his life instantly and permanently. And what happens at this point? A three-minute timer starts causing the hunter transport shuttle to arrive and any hunters who have died to respawn until the timer expires. This peculiarity of the game that may seem trivial is actually the basis of a hunt and escape mechanic that is truly the focal point of the entire Evolve experience. An example is crucial to understand each other better. Hunters spend much of the game in the game's base mode, Hunt, trying to track down the monster and slaughter it with lead. At a certain point, however, the player who controls the monster may decide to be ready for battle because perhaps he has evolved or feels master of his abilities. Both factions are well aware that if the animal kills all the hunters it wins the game and this means that if for some reason the ruthless giant manages to take out maybe two or even three hunters, the survivor will have to try in every way to escape and hide while waiting for the respawn timer to expire and for his teammates to come back into play. The result is that at any moment the relationship between hunter and hunted can be reversed and this factor is the basis of a title that also offers other game modes capable of further enhancing this variety. The same goes for hunters for monsters too. Basically Evolve offers three. The Goliath, the classic corpulent monster, rather awkward in his movements and specialized in close-range attacks, with also some gems to amaze from a distance such as the launch of a huge boulder or a jump capable of reaching opponents in an instant and damaging them at the same time. The Kraken, a specialized animal, to counteract in ranged combat thanks to its ability to levitate in the air and throw lightning bolts and ball mines while, from above, it observes the battlefield. And finally there is the Specter, a real war machine capable of teleporting, moving with great speed and performing a series of close-quarters combat with particularly showy damage. Also in the case of monsters, the player will have four skills to manage but compared to hunters, he will not have all of them available from the beginning. Each evolution of the monster (there are two for a total of three levels) corresponds to three points that can be spent to acquire or upgrade skills (which also have these three levels). This means that, even at the third level, the animal will eventually be able to maximize three of the four skills, or divide the points. The last feature of the monster is its life energy. This cannot be recovered in any way during the match, but can only be increased with each evolution based on some pre-set ~steps~. Feeding on the fauna that populates the world of Shear, however, he will be able to earn armor that protects him from blows by consuming himself instead of vital energy. Each monster can accumulate a certain amount of maximum armor and also in this case the gameplay gives rise to constant tactical choices while you are fighting: continue to attack the hunters because maybe you killed the doctor but jeopardizing your own vital energy that can't be recovered, or run away to eat some animals and then restore some armor? And then it must be considered that with each evolution the armor is canceled, making the monster even more vulnerable at the very moment in which it strengthens. That weird feeling called balance It is evident from what we have just written that the Turtle Rock Studios guys have studied: they have not limited themselves to doing their homework at all. The search for a perfect balance, for a variety to be offered to the player to compensate for a gameplay that apparently can seem extremely repetitive and rather linear, for that particular alchemy that is created between players when they are faced with a multiplayer experience truly capable of giving satisfactions was the basis of the entire development work and is probably the result of experience gained over the years of Left 4 Dead. And it was therefore a pity to note, on the part of the writer, that at least two macroscopic defects seem to undermine a truly innovative gaming experience for a genre, that of first person shooters, which has been stuck for too long on the stylistic features of Call of Duty and most recently revived with the acclaimed but equally contested MMO soul of Destiny. The first problemmatic that afflicts Evolve is that relating to the progression system. Basically, in order to have access to the second and third character of each class, as well as the Kraken and the Specter, it is necessary to reach the first level ~mastery~ in each of the four hunter and monster skills (each can reach the third level with consequent passive bonuses). This means carrying out a series of activities that in some cases come naturally when playing, for example with the assaulter where it is quite obvious to do damage with both weapons, but in many others they actually force you to ~spam~ skills that would usually only be used in very sporadic incidents. Why are we forced to throw hundreds of gas bombs, or place dozens of traps or, again, spend entire games shooting the sniper rifle while using the medic just to be able to access the next character? And the same, of course, goes for the monster. It is not very clear whether it is an attempt by the developer to force the player to use every single peculiarity of the character to exhaustion or a very clever way to dramatically increase the hours of play (consider that to unlock the third monster it will take you no less than four, five hours) but the result is absolutely dramatic. If you play with other people you run the risk of making the game degenerate in an instant and losing your team in an attempt to pursue the completion of an activity and therefore you find yourself forced to make hundreds of matches with the bots, perhaps setting the game completely in our favor, just to be there, in the middle of the map always using the same ability so that it grows quickly. And we ask ourselves, wasn't it better to offer all the content immediately to the player, leaving it up to his skills and abilities to choose the ideal character for his style of play? Or, couldn't we think of an additional mode dedicated to this gain of experience, where maybe there isn't the monster, or vice versa the hunters, chasing you constantly but maybe you can only dedicate yourself to killing fauna? Among other things, Evolve offers a further unlock system relating to the perks that are earned by leveling up the profile, the experience of which matures simply by playing and achieving certain results and which can then be mounted, one at a time, at the beginning of every match to have access to a passive bonus. But do you only go hunting? The other more invasive problem concerns the basic mode of Evolve, the one on which practically the entire marketing campaign of the game was based and the only one that we were made to try on all the occasions in which the game was testable: the hunt . In fact, in the iconic four-on-one of the game, some limitations inherent in such asymmetrical gameplay come to light. In fact, the match tends to be resolved within the first few minutes or after practically nothing has happened for ten, fifteen minutes and in both cases the result is rather frustrating. In fact, if you are in the role of the hunters and the team is particularly lucky or the trapper knows how to do his duty extremely well, then he is capable that the monster is immediately intercepted and for the player at his command life becomes very difficult given and considering that being at the first level and not being able to escape to be able to feed and evolve means already having one foot in the grave. Conversely, if the monster is particularly skilled (or very lucky) and manages to remain in the shadows for the time necessary to reach level three, the outcome is reversed in an instant and the battle becomes practically one-way. After that, among other things, maybe ten minutes have been spent with the hunters wandering around the map following the footsteps or listening to the usual birds that ~wake up~ when the monster passes by them. It is paradoxical that in short, it is precisely the ~typical~ mode of Evolve that suffers the most given that in the final package we find three others that are extremely more interesting and capable of giving life to much more stimulating and fun games. In fact, we find Salvation where increasingly numerous groups of humans ~activate~ within the map and must be found and brought to safety if you are a hunter or killed if you are the monster; nest where the situation is reversed given that the animal will have to defend a certain number of eggs hidden around the map while humans will have to destroy them within a time limit but with the interesting variant represented by the fact that the monster can decide to sacrifice a egg to awaken an ally, a smaller Goliath that moves autonomously to hunt down hunters. Then there's defense, a sort of va", "date": "2015-02-15", "grade": "8.0"}
