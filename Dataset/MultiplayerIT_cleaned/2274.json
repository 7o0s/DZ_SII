{"name": "New York Race", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/new-york-race.html", "text": "Like any self-respecting car game, also in NYR there is the possibility to choose the vehicle. Initially you will have the Taxi GMT Photon, practically the same one that Bruce Willis drives in the film, but then later you will be able to gain access to other vehicles that will offer better performance. Each vehicle will in turn have four different characteristics: the maximum speed (of course!), the handling, the force field and the dive. As for the circuits there is not much choice, in fact there are only four: Middle Class, Jet Set, Chinatown and The Slums. Let's start by saying that from a graphic point of view the game is very confusing, with excessive background noise and a painful definition. All this contributes to making everything more disastrous than it already is; this is because the idea itself is already dispersive, with the possibility of moving along the vertical of the screen quite freely, and in addition there is this graphic roughness ... in the end there is only a great cacophony of color and that's it. Another thing I really don't understand is the massive presence of slowdowns. It is unacceptable that after all this time the programmers do not know how to make the most of the potential of the Ps2 hardware. I don't always ask for the masterpiece, but these things are the basis of everything! Having just mentioned the freedom of movement I would like to consider the controls and the gameplay aspect in general. The cars respond quite well to the movements of the stick but from the point of view of playability we are just not there. First of all, the speed effect is minimal, and this already gives little involvement, plus at the beginning the difficulty is very high, either because the tracks are confusing, or because our taxi goes really slowly and then also because a small mistake is enough , like a collision, to lose precious seconds and basically the entire race. Finding the way is sometimes really difficult. It's nice to be able to move in all directions and over a large area, but here it's too dispersive. It must also be said that in the end the game becomes decidedly monotonous and, despite the possibility of playing in twos, the interest is raised a little, the few courses and the few tournaments make it a little too short and repetitive. At least the use of ~wipeout~ style weapons is nice, with the possibility of shooting at other cars with four types of weapons: Water, Earth, Fire, Air. The sound aspect is nice, with average dance music. I'm sorry that programmers today don't understand that it's not enough to write the name of a successful movie on the packaging to sell copies. The example of Wipeout is enough to realize that how a well-chosen concept (and NYR refers a lot to the Psygnosys title) however combined with an at least decent technical realization, manages to attract a fair number of buyers, given that by now on the Ps2 there are flower of driving games. Pros: Official License of the Fifth Element Cute Dance Music Cons: Slowdowns Too Short Confusing In 2215 the city of New York organized races through its labyrinthine streets.obviously in the sky.Inspired by Luc Besson's cinematic masterpiece The Fifth Element, this racing game obviously takes its cue only from the part relating to the Taxi race . As is now the practice, programmers who refer to film licenses are unlikely to be able to churn out decent products and as was to be expected, NYR is no exception. At the beginning, in addition to the classic developer credits, we are offered a presentation that uses the game engine but which is flat and not very engaging. Once the language has been selected, the menu gives us the possibility to make four choices regarding the game modes: Championship, Single Race, Time Trial and finally Keirin. The first consists of completing three laps of the circuit facing seven opponents and being entitled to four attempts. The championship then includes four successive categories: qualification, beginner, professional and expert. In order to access each subsequent category, at least third parties must be qualified. The other alternative is the competition called Keirin which consists of eight competitors and eliminations at checkpoints: at each checkpoint the last arrived is eliminated. This is repeated in three races until only one competitor remains.", "date": "2002-01-14", "grade": null}
