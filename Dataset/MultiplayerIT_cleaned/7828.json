There is now no occasion in which the Japanese company does not try to insert the characters or stories of its terror series, proposing them in every sauce and on every console. Among the latter there was also the Nintendo 3DS, which last year saw in Resident Evil: Revelations not only the first great original episode of the saga to debut on a portable platform of the Japanese company, but also a great critical success and the public, proving to be an extremely interesting product albeit not without some flaws. In line with this philosophy and one year later, the title is re-proposed in high definition on home consoles and on personal computers, in a special revised and corrected edition for these platforms. Chronologically set between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, the game tells of the events following the creation of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), the anti-terrorism group that sees Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine among its co-founders. Following the disappearance of Chris and his partner Jessica Sherawat during an investigation aboard a luxury cruise ship, the Queen Zenobia, Jill and her colleague Parker Luciani go on the boat to understand what happened. Once there, the two agents discover that the ship is infested with aberrations generated by the T-Abyss, a marine strain of the T-virus, and a terrifying struggle for survival begins for them, in the truest sense of the word. The product, in fact, is a horror adventure game with a third-person view (the camera is positioned as in the latest Resident Evil) characterized by a gameplay with a classic style, from an old survival, and therefore proposes themes and mechanics for a large part of the game which mark a partial return to the origins: staid rhythm (except in a handful of scenarios focused on shootings), puzzles (few to tell the truth), monsters and that pinch of fan service that never hurts. Terror at sea The main scenario of the game, namely that of the ship, lends itself perfectly to the aforementioned atmospheres of fear and tension. The gamer comes into contact with situations that are sometimes claustrophobic and with no apparent escape route, moving with the character within enclosed environments, alone and surrounded by the sea. Along the gloomy narrow corridors often dimly lit that connect the various areas, and which end at an angle, anything can be hidden, and it is easy to come across some monstrous creatures. The latter generally occur in a not excessive number at the same time, also due to the narrow spaces in which the user is forced to act, so there is almost never the risk of being outnumbered. Just like in the old episodes of Resident Evil. There are no zombies, recently returned to the fore within the saga thanks to Resident Evil 6, where they have been revived together with other aberrations especially in Leon's scenario, in Resident Evil: Revelations they have been largely replaced by creatures called Ooze . The latter for gait and attack patterns quite resemble the traditional living dead, a little less for the design, rather anonymous and stylistically more similar to that of deformed humanoids. During the development of the adventure, which presents an episodic television-style structure, between flashbacks, continuous changes of protagonists and some slightly telephoned twists, the gamer nevertheless encounters other types of enemies, some of which taken from the other chapters of the saga. To eliminate them there is no shortage of the usual paraphernalia ranging from the pistol to the shotgun, from the knife to a new type of grenade, up to the assault or sniper rifle. Each weapon is equipped with different slots in which it is possible to insert useful components to improve its performance, such as power, accuracy, and more. However, the spaces reserved for upgrades are not unlimited and the latter, as well as being difficult to find, cannot be used on multiple weapons at the same time, forcing the user to think carefully before deciding how to ~spend~ an item. At the bottom of the sea For the rest, the title offers a couple of not sensational but certainly nice news. Above all the one made up of the Genesis, a sort of scanner with which it is possible to examine the settings, the corpses of the victims and the enemies to obtain objects of various kinds or useful information, even if this feature in our opinion is not fully exploited properly. Then there is the interesting feature that makes practicalIt is useless to study the position of the enemies in the game, since the latter change their location every time the game is restarted. The same criterion was adopted by the developers for the arrangement of the objects, both the important ones, which serve as always to the main character to get to the bottom of some enigma, and those of basic necessity useful for accumulating bullets and healing herbs, which therefore forces every gamer to always carefully explore the environments in which he finds himself. Among other things, Revelations provides some backtracking for which there is always the possibility of retracing one's steps and reviewing some areas more calmly. Changes also for the options relating to the degree of difficulty of the adventure, with the addition of a further level called Inferno: by selecting it, the user must deal with many more enemies than normal, which are also harder to defeat. Obviously in this way the gaming experience becomes much more action than normal. In terms of content, Resident Evil: Revelations also offers secondary modes, which demonstrate Capcom's particular commitment to packaging a complete and satisfactory product from every point of view. Thus we have the missions, or objectives to be met to obtain bonuses of various kinds, and the Raid mode. The latter, which can be tackled in single or local or online multiplayer, is based on fragments of levels infested with enemies to be killed until you reach the exit. At the end of each stage, in addition to developing your character, you can earn weapons and points to spend in a special shop based on factors such as the time taken to complete the level, which portions of the monsters' bodies have been hit or the precision of the blows inflicted on them. A stimulating and fun mode, especially if tackled cooperatively with a friend, and where, among others, fans of the series can meet again the character of Hunk (also in a female version by downloading a special DLC) which adds to those available. Playstation 3 trophies There are 51 Trophies available in Resident Evil: Revelations, all distributed within both the main campaign and the Raid mode. They are divided into 42 Bronze, 5 Silver, 3 Gold and 1 Platinum. As always, the ways to obtain them are different: they range from killing a Scarmiglione without eliminating its body parts separately, to scraping together all the weapons or inflicting 100,000 points of damage on an enemy with a single blow for lower objectives, up to pass all levels in Raid mode on Abyss difficulty with an S rating or complete the normal adventure on Inferno difficulty for the most prestigious ones. Something is changed So far we have analyzed in detail the purely narrative and content aspects of the product. But what are the substantial novelties of the game from a technical point of view compared to the portable counterpart? The most noticeable changes were made by Capcom to the control system. As our most attentive readers will remember, one of the most obvious flaws of the Nintendo 3DS version was related to the control scheme, which for a variety of reasons effectively forced the most demanding players to get a Circle Pad Pro. The latter provided a better grip of the console and superior comfort on long sessions, as well as the possibility of managing the view and interaction with objects more effectively. It is therefore obvious that the same result was obtained with the adaptation of the controls to the PlayStation 3 pad, decidedly more friendly and suitable for the purpose, above all in the rapid management of the primary and secondary weapons and, thanks to the two extra backbones, also of the scanner and some grenades. In such productions, however, what obviously immediately catches the eye, at least at first glance, is inevitably the graphics. In this sense, Capcom, while obviously not reaching the quality level of a Resident Evil 6, seems to have really done a great job, keeping in mind the starting point. The new textures used to cover the polygons that make up the characters, monsters and environments, and the clever use of light and particle effects actually give a satisfactory overview, even if in some environments you notice some elements that are a bit flat and poorly defined. The cut-scenes contribute to this, redone ad hoc to be adapted to the new resolution, and a respectable sound sector. In it we have an excellent dubbing in Italian, and above all a skilful use of music and background sounds by the technicians. The former are stylistically along the lines of the other productions in the saga, which means they perform wellone's work underlining at the right moment the salient moments of the adventure or even a ~simple~ twist or moment of fear (a monster that suddenly jumps out of nowhere, for example). The latter help to make the solitary walk of the characters more credible among the meanders of areas which, as mentioned in the course of the review, are closed, often not very spacious. The water dripping from a roof, the echo of one's footsteps, the creak of metal that seems to writhe, that of pipes that seem to explode at any moment, are all audio elements that make the atmosphere more engaging and frightening. gameplay, helping the gamer to further immerse himself in the gloomy atmosphere of the story.
