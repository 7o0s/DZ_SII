Nolan Bushnell of Atari stole from Ralph Baer, the designer of Magnavox's Odyssey, that simple yet ingenious idea that would later launch the video game industry: two rackets placed on opposite sides of the screen, which move only vertically, and a ball to clear: whoever misses the ball more than once loses. The project was to create a kind of ping pong simulation, but the result was the creation of an archetypal video game which, either by virtue of the authors or due to the technological limits of the time, staged in a way that has become iconic of the essential elements of playing and of the gamer: the comparison. Since then the Pong scheme has been used in countless titles, arcade and otherwise, evolving together with the hardware, but never giving up on its founding core. One of these epigones was Windjammers, a Neo Geo arcade and console title released in 1994 by Data East, in which two athletes, placed on opposite sides of various playing fields, had to compete to see who could stick the most frisbees into the opponent's goal , to reach 15 points. It was a simple but ruthlessly entertaining game, but it didn't give rise to a series and never had a sequel... or, at least, hasn't until today. The Windjammers 2 review talks about the surprise you don't expect and which you discover, after a few games, that you can no longer do without. The hinterland Windjammers 2 is the surprise of January Really, who expected to kick off 2022 with the Windjammers sequel? Above all, who thought it would be done so well that the original would not be regretted? Usually these operations leave the time they find, that is, nice games come out that wink at the fans of some averagely famous series of the past, which are no longer of interest to the big industry, and die there. In recent years, the French publisher Dotemu, now controlled by Focus Home Interactive, has stood out for the recovery of titles from the past, first republishing some of them in very successful operations such as the Double Dragon Trilogy, then commissioning high-level remakes such as that of Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap and finally creating or commissioning new episodes of series considered dead such as Pang Adventures, but above all the excellent Streets of Rage 4, which also sold very well. Now it's Windjammers 2's turn, probably taken up more for love of the original than thinking about the possibility of selling millions of copies, since we're not talking about a name with who knows what appeal to the masses. Also playable alone, Windjammers gave its best against another human being, where matches became something physical both inside the screen and in reality, with the special attacks of the six selectable players that were often underlined by blatant gestures and coarse screams, above all after scoring points. Windjammers 2 doesn't just celebrate the original, but takes up its spirit, presenting itself as a renewed version of a formula that cannot be perfected any more than it already is and which would be destroyed by any kind of structural change. So here too the playing fields are fixed screens, therefore without any scrolling or zooming, and here again the 2D graphics have been chosen, less pixel art and more illustration, but still very colorful and lively, so as not to lose the style of the original along the way. Of course there are some new features in terms of content, but let's go in order. Game modes and characters The super shots have very nice animations Once Windjammers 2 is started, we are given the choice of selecting one of the three available modes: online multiplayer, made up of quick, classified, or customized games, of which it is possible to set the general parameters (duration, score to be achieved and so on); the arcade mode, in which once the difficulty level is selected we have to win five games against the CPU to become the world champion of the discipline and the versus mode, where we can play a single match locally against a human opponent or against the CPU. The roster of playable characters is not very large, but in our opinion it is more than sufficient for the type of game: there are ten athletes who stand out for their power and speed values, as well as for their special shots. Six are returning, i.e. they were also present in the first chapter: the Japanese Hiromi Mita, the fastest and least powerful of the group, the Englishman Steve miller, another very fast character, the Spaniard Jordi Costa and the Italian Loris Biaggi (curiosity : the name derives from the motorcyclists Loris Capirossi and Max Biaggi), both endowed with balanced values, the American Gary Scottand the German Klaus Wessel, both very powerful, but decidedly slow. The new levers do not disfigure in front of the old ones The new levers are the very fast J. Raposa, Brazilian, the French S. Dalys, who honors the nationality of the developers and is a fairly balanced character, the Canadian H-Max, powerful but slow and the Chinese S.Ho, another character balanced. The only one absent is Korean Bee-Ho Yoo, who appeared in the original version of Windjammers in place of Steve Miller in all territories except the US. In reality, the two characters had identical sprites, but with different voiceovers. It should be noted that each character has his own ending, often linked to the clichs of his nation (spoiler: guess what Loris Biagi ends up with? Working in a pizzeria where he is attacked by mafiosi who he silences with pizza shots. .. only the mandolin is missing). Overall they're not exactly the best, but it's a passable extra, except for those who want Windjammers 2 for its narrative side (who, pray tell?). The fields The fields are all different from each other, not only graphically Windjammers was all about pure enjoyment and that of Windjammers 2 is exactly the same. Indeed, without bothering a random and impalpable concept such as fun, we would like to define it as a cheerful game, a word that makes better what one feels when playing it. But let us return to its more concrete aspects. Once you have selected your favorite character, it's time to take the field. Without making too many bows to modernity, the Arcade mode is slightly more structured than that of the original and for each match it allows you to choose between two playing fields, for two different opponents. Only the last match is fixed, ie it is played on a field chosen by the CPU and against the last remaining player among the ten. Paon DP, the development team, has also maintained the idea of the two bonus stages, confirming one already seen in the first Windjammers, that of throwing the frisbee on the beach, which consists in throwing the puck as far as possible making sure that it is caught on the fly from a dog running after him. The second, however, has been modified: no more bowling, but a challenge to catch and smash discs thrown by a Frisbee shooting machine. Some fields offer peculiar elements Their playing fields all have peculiarities that make them unique and which, despite the presence of apparently minimal differences, profoundly alter the strategies to be adopted to win, depending on the selected character. For example, there are narrower fields, such as the beach, which favor slower characters, because the latter run less risk of leaving uncovered corners where the opponent can try to slip in his shots, while on the contrary, the more large ones, such as the stadium or the casino, benefit quicker characters who can cover greater distances more quickly with their slides. In any case, there are also other variables to consider, such as for example the presence of small obstacles placed in the middle of some fields, which can make the trajectory of the disc less predictable, even reaching the point of blocking it, or the positioning of the gates of the points, which require to better cover the areas of the field which, if punctured, would earn more points for the opponent. Gameplay Speed or power? As we said, the gameplay of Windjammers 2 is very fast. Each character has very high mobility: in addition to walking, he can perform more or less rapid slides and can jump to try and catch the frisbee on the fly, to perhaps crush it in the opponent's field and score two points. Frisbee throwing techniques are even more and, once mastered, they give many possibilities in tactical terms, even if you have to learn to think very quickly about what to do, becoming as instinctive as possible in your responses, if you want to have any chance of victory against the strongest players. However, in addition to the normal shots of various power, it is possible to perform spin shots, therefore with less predictable trajectories; dove shots, which are used to try to knock the puck to the ground in the opponent's half of the field; the aforementioned dunk and quick responses, with which you basically punch the puck by quickly repelling it from the other side of the field. There are also several super shots, which are activated after having charged up by putting oneself in a position to recover the puck, after having saved it: a flat shot, which rolls towards the opponent's goal, a spinning shot, which spins around the field, and the special shot, different depending on the selected character. To give a couple of examples, Loris Biagi creates godsswirls of fire with the frisbee, while Jordi Costa performs a very fast Zig Zag shot. Offensive and defensive techniques offer a great tactical leeway It is important to note that the player has full control over the rolls his character makes. During the first few games it actually seems to be at the mercy of chance, but the more you become aware of the control system and the combinations of keys and stick movements, useful for giving directions and effects, the more exciting the games become because you really feel masters of the playing field and you understand that there is nothing random: you win if you are good (relative to the selected difficulty level or that of the human opponent encountered) and if you learn to exploit the spaces left by the opponent while dominating their own half. At the highest levels, Windwammers 2 becomes a real show, with shots in rapid series that seem almost choreographed, also helped by the physicality with which the puck interacts with the characters, which gives a unique feeling, and with games played until last second (when time runs out, whoever has the most points wins the round, while the game is won by the best of two, at least the standard ones). We soon realize that there are more variations to consider than they seem at first glance, such as the energy bar that charges in the lower right corner while playing, which once full allows you to perform a special defense technique , which automatically locks the puck within a certain area, or an enhanced version of the super shot. Conclusions Will we catch him or will it be stitches? Particular praise deserves the fact that Windjammers 2 is a game that deeply respects the player's time. In fact, a single game lasts a few minutes, while the arcade mode takes about half an hour to finish (winning all the games). By accumulating points you win credits that allow you to continue in case of defeat, but the game time is slightly longer and you never feel oppressed by not knowing if you will be able to finish what you are doing or not. Some might consider the not many contents a malus, but one sincerely wonders what other characters or other fields could have added to the game, given the balances achieved with the included roster. After all we are talking about an arcade title to the core that makes the most of it especially if played with other human beings, so what matters is not so much the outline, but the fulcrum of the gameplay and the refinement of the mechanics that regulate it, in this case excellent. As a comparison, even if a little forced, we should mention Rocket League, which holds up very well even without all the cosmetic extras added over the years. On the other hand, the game is visually very tasty, even if it doesn't work miracles, thanks to the details that fill each field, especially from the audience side (the fields are designed for maximum readability), and to the beautiful animations of the shots and the characters. The substance is that Windjammers 2 is a little gem that has projected us into a dimension of play that we haven't experienced for some time, also reminding us of the times of the arcades, with the queues in front of the most popular cabinets and the coins placed in the bins to get some minute of happiness.", "date": "2022-01-20", "grade": "9.0"}
