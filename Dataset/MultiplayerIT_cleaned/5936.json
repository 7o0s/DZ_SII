The Rainbow Studios developers have always associated their name with the arcade racing genre and in particular with offroad racing, since the days of ATV Offroad Fury and MX Unleashed for PlayStation 2. In recent years, however, their products have lent their side to easy criticism for the limited amount of innovative content and the prevailing repetitiveness. After the discrete results achieved at the time of Untamed and Reflex - released on the market in the two-year period 2008/2010 - the steps backwards encountered with the publication of Alive and Supercross have made themselves felt. That's why we didn't have particular expectations towards MX vs ATV Supercross Encore, a revised and theoretically improved version of the title released last autumn on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. If in its first incarnation the game had not been able to convince both the critics and the public , it's now official: the objective was failed twice. The contents of MX vs ATV Supercross Encore are repetitive and not at all original The alleged news On paper Supercross Encore should have been a technically updated and improved version thanks to further content. However, a brief test pad in hand was enough to understand that the ideas are totally absent and the playful proposal mostly insufficient, to the point of making the return of the product to the shelves unjustified. Compared to last year's edition, twelve new tracks have been introduced, which are by no means new but come from MX vs ATV Alive. From the latter, the Free Ride mode has also been dusted off, which allows you to freely explore various maps, both alone and in the company of friends and to perform stunts and evolutions with relative freedom of movement. Basically we are dealing with a questionable recycling job, which involves the re-proposition of a mode with little attraction for the player and structured in a rather approximate way. Alongside the classic Supercross and Rhythm Racing, Waypoint was then re-proposed, which involves going through a series of checkpoints and identifying the easiest route to the checkered flag. Also in this case, however, the new scenarios that have been made available to the public had already been proposed in Alive as well, so we don't have any unpublished material on balance. The remaining updating work concerned the outfits of the more than seventy pilots present in the game, which are supported by various original licenses and are updated to the 2015 season. Although Rainbow Studios wanted to clarify that the models of the pilots and the textures of all the tracks have been taken up and enjoy an improved rendering, the resulting impression is that of a product prepared in a rush, arranged with the least possible use of resources and not at all in line with current events, resulting visually very poor both in navigating through the menus and after setting foot on the track. The only feature that goes beyond the sufficiency concerns the audio sector, for which new sounds and better environmental effects have been introduced, supported by the already usual soundtrack that accompanied the original episode. Playstation 4 trophies There are a total of 30 MX vs ATV Supercross Encore Trophies, including five gold, ten silver and fourteen bronze. A good number are dedicated to completing the career, while the rest are related to the online side or performing stunts. Few stimuli The Supercross Encore driving model guarantees an immediate approach even to all those who have never had the opportunity to approach the series in the past, although the addition of a special tutorial also gives the opportunity to receive slightly more precise indications on the suitable techniques to control your motorbike or quad in the best possible way. When going down the runway it is necessary to keep in mind what the references are for the exploitation of the slopes, in particular the use of the so-called pre-load, i.e. the charge that can be imparted before performing each jump and making sure to land as quickly as possible. far as possible. This function is crucial above all when you find yourself competing in the Supercross mode, which is also the main category on which the game is built and in which the circuits are full of ups and downs, even very steep ones, which must be overcome in flight to gain seconds valuable to opponents. However, the efforts of Rainbow Studios in trying to make the necessary changes to the physics of the vehicles have not been able to convince us. There are still obvious problems in the management of collisions with other drivers on the track and some unnatural behaviors, anomalous rebounds and quite senseless off-track exits can also be noted. The greatest difficulties arise during landing and while drifting with the use of the right analog stick: in many cases the sensitivity of this vehicle control tool appears too sensitive and can lead, especially in the case of motorcycles, to sudden and unjustified slowdowns, or lead to an excessive rotation of the steering wheel which can suddenly throw the rider towards the internal protections of the curve in progress. There are a total of thirteen vehicles, equally divided between motocross bikes and quads, but it is demeaning to consider how the series still today hasn't made any progress in terms of customizing its vehicle. In fact, it is possible to decide the category and engine size to which it belongs, provided that this has already been unlocked, but no changes can be made to the various components or liveries. As was the case previously, the pilots are numerous, in fact we are talking about over seventy personalities extrapolated from the official licenses. Apart from these details Supercross Encore has little else to offer. The Career mode, which should usually be a central element in the balance of a driving title, is really very low in content and confirms the idea that the game was developed in a hurry in order to guarantee further market release. Once again all you have to do is face a multitude of access tickets to championships of different categories, in which you have to at least procure the podium. There is no hint of rider progression and the activities that take place are mainly focused on the Supercross mode, which puts all other types of game in the background. Nothing to do even with regard to the multiplayer mode, which can be experienced online up to a maximum of 12 players or exploited through the traditional local split-screen intended for only two users. The changes are in fact almost non-existent compared to last year, with the usual five categories also selectable for online clashes.", "date": "2015-10-28", "grade": "5.0"}
