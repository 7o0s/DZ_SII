Yet the title developed by Cornfox & Bros immediately ignited the attention of iOS device owners, basically thanks to an extraordinarily marked inspiration - and never denied - with the Zelda series. Considering that the Nintendo franchise will never officially reach the mobile market, it is clear to many that it seemed that Oceanhorn could in a certain sense occupy this empty space, with the guarantee that even if only absorbing some reflected light from the adventures of Link could have turned out to be a quality product. Oceanhorn is sadly not the high quality game we would have hoped to see Without princess We talked about ~inspiration~ with respect to the Zelda series, even if for most of the elements that make up Oceanhorn one could rather easily use the term plagiarism: the protagonist is in fact a boy called to solve much bigger problems than him wielding a sword and shield, tackling environments and dungeons filled with enemies and puzzles from a fixed overhead view. There are hearts and keys to collect, chests to open, and items like bombs, bows and spells to retrieve to expand one's abilities. And as if that weren't enough, the world to visit in the adventure is in fact made up of islands to be reached via a small boat, sailing solo from one to the other. Let me be clear, these are only some of the most obvious references to the Nintendo masterpiece, but there would be so many others to fill the entire review with just the list. The problem with Oceanhorn is that its merits are basically those based precisely on copy-paste work, on the recovery of other people's ideas, because when instead it comes to analyzing the flour of the Finnish developer's bag, one begins to see rather obvious and important limits . Starting with the poor quality and variety of puzzles, which too often rest on very trivial or even boring and irritating mechanics; pressing keys to open gates or moving crates is the norm, repeated with great and irritating frequency. More generally, it is the game design that turns out to be modest, lacking the quality necessary to raise the Cornfox & Bros title to at least desirable levels considering the development time; the cohesion between the various elements is not very convincing as is the rhythm and progression, which turn out to be cumbersome and lame. The scarcity of indications on how to proceed does not translate into freedom and an invitation to explore, but rather into a frequent and frustrating disorientation. In the same way, the control system also appears unrewarding, while the combat is based on too simplistic, repetitive and mechanical dynamics, which have repercussions starting from the clashes with common enemies to also involve the boss fights. And it is a pity that the plot, derivative and never epic or engaging, fails to at least partially compensate for the gameplay problems. We could be accused of excessive severity towards what is actually a game developed by a team of 3 people with no great experience behind them, but it is also necessary to underline how Oceanhorn is sold on the App Store at a price of 7.99, much higher than the average figures of titles distributed on Apple's online store. A cost that necessarily imposes a certain type of criticism, beyond the commitment and good intentions of the guys from Cornfox & Bros. Where instead the publication of FDG Entertainment manages to convince without too many discussions is in the graphic component, truly remarkable even if it lacks a pinch of personality and more variety. Nonetheless Oceanhorn is undoubtedly a beautiful game to look at, full of details, well designed, with an interesting use of colors and always fluid. Obviously all factors that are enhanced by using a device with a Retina display. On the other hand, on the subject of sound, it is good to make a separate discussion: the collaboration with the Masters Nobuo Uematsu and Kenji Ito, authors among many things of some of the most successful soundtracks of Square Enix titles, has in fact guaranteed several tracks of absolute value , even if there are some less successful passages.", "date": "2013-11-25", "grade": "6.7"}
