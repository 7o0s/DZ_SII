Does the light go out just when a dangerous serial killer has been sighted in the city? They go immediately to check the control unit of the electrical system. Ghostly noises coming from an abandoned house? They rush in to take a look. In short, they love to get into trouble. Nigel Danvers, the character we control in The Lost Crown: A Ghost Adventure is no exception. His mission is to investigate the mysteries of Saxton, a city located on the coast of England, and to unravel them he won't back down from anything. His equipment consists of the most sophisticated devices for detecting ectoplasm, highly precise instruments that used in the right way can really reveal otherworldly presences, sometimes benevolent but often evil. Danvers arrives at Saxton train station and realizes that someone else is following the same lead as him. Between strange sightings, mysterious places and inhabitants more or less reluctant to cooperate, his determination will lead him to meet real ghosts and to try to understand the reason for their presence. Ghost Buster Fans of ~point and click~ adventures will find no difficulty in becoming familiar with the mechanics that regulate the gameplay of The Lost Crown: A Ghost Adventure. In fact, we are faced with a classic-style product, with a simple interface devoid of innovative elements, in which it is necessary to interact with all the characters and face each ramification of the dialogues from time to time, because very often in the words of our interlocutors the key to solving a puzzle and to the continuation of the story is hidden. The pointer clearly signals the presence of interactable areas in the scenario, the puzzles as usual are visually represented by special screens and their resolution generally appears without obscure logical leaps. The developers have also opted for an approach to the puzzles limited to the locations in which they are located, so to solve a particular puzzle we will not have to look for clues outside the area in which it is located. The experience is certainly simplified from this point of view, but an alternative solution would perhaps have given rise to episodes of frustration and dead spots that would have further loaded the game with breaks and rhythms that are anything but tight. And this is precisely one of the defects of the title created by Blue Label Entertainment: the movements of the protagonist are extremely slow and the whole exploratory phase is affected. In short, the approximately thirty hours that make up the adventure include a lot of useless waiting. The truth lies in the nuances The technical realization of the game is at least controversial. The adoption of ~black and white~ (represented by a simple grayscale rather than some more ~artistic~ solution) constitutes a precise choice of style, whereas some elements of the screen appear colored instead. This type of solution ends up enhancing some sequences, in particular those shot with the video camera and detection devices, but it cannot in any way fix the technical shortcomings of TLC: the design of the characters is mediocre, the quality some animations would have been scarce even ten years ago and the ~low budget~ character of the project is immediately noticeable. There are teams of developers who have managed to give their products a quality visual appearance despite the scarce resources available, but this is not the case. As far as sound is concerned, music and sounds contribute to the creation of a good atmosphere, but the flatness of the dialogues (spoken in textbook English, at least out of place) works a bit against it.", "date": "2009-12-01", "grade": "7.0"}
