{"name": "Bocce World Tour", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bocce-world-tour.html", "text": "Digital Chocolate is one of the software houses that is best operating on the mobile video game market, creating a series of truly above-average quality titles. Perhaps few people know that the founding father of this label is in fact Trip Hawkins, one of the most expert connoisseurs of the world of electronic entertainment, to whom we owe the birth of Electronic Arts and the ill-fated 3DO console. And so, after Tower Bloxx, Brain Juice Energy, Rollercoaster Rush, Tornado Mania and much more, today we find ourselves talking about Bocce World Tour, an atypical and original digital version of the popular beach sport (and not only). The main mode, the World Tour, puts the player in the role of one of the two protagonists (a boy or a girl) in an attempt to become world bowls champion. Obviously the road will be all uphill, since four opponents will stand in front of the lens ready to welcome the challengers to ~their own home~, or in the settings of New York, Paris, the South Pole and Easter Island. Each of these locations brings with it a different playing field, with different characteristics that substantially and markedly affect the behavior of the balls; playing on ice, for example, lengthens the slide a lot, while the opposite happens in the mud. On the other hand, situations on grass and dirt are intermediate; more generally, in all locations it may happen that you are faced with a further factor to evaluate, namely the presence of puddles capable of blocking the movement of your bowls. As for the control system, it is a rather simple method borrowed from the classic one of golf games; in practice, after having changed the direction of the launch, two bars must be loaded, respectively determining the strength and precision of the same. As a partial aid for the player, colored flags are positioned on the track, also reproduced on the strength bar, with which to take the ~measurements~ and optimally evaluate the management of the shot. Playing Bocce World Tour is therefore a genuinely fun and rewarding experience, also thanks to the good physics adopted by the programmers; both the rolling of the spheres and the reactions resulting from the impact with the others or with the snitch are credible. Especially in the advanced levels, therefore, a strong element of strategy and tactics is also inserted, which makes the product much deeper than one might imagine at first. Unfortunately, however, the Digital Chocolate production is penalized by a major flaw, or rather by the sensational brevity of the main mode, and more generally by an almost incredible limitation in content; only two characters to choose from, 4 opponents and 4 settings are really too little, and getting to the end of the World Tour takes no more than an hour of gameplay. The absolute lack of extras therefore reduces the interest to the multiplayer mode only, which is divided into the possibility of sending one's scores to a server and seeing one's position in the standings, and more traditionally challenging a human opponent by switching the mobile phone from hand to each shift. A more than pleasant graphic aspect and a perfect sound are therefore not enough to save a product that deserved to be developed in a more consistent way. PRO Fun Good physics Graphically valid AGAINST Unacceptable scarcity of content It only takes one hour to complete it", "date": "2007-08-21", "grade": "S.V."}
