{"name": "FIFA 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-08-recensione_b.html", "text": "Any self-respecting console must have its adaptation of Fifa by Electronic Arts. And since Nintendo Wii is a highly respected console, even if only for the incredible number of living rooms in which it has taken place in homes around the world, the American giant has well thought of creating a chapter of its hugely popular football franchise in able to take full advantage of the unique characteristics of the Wiimote and Nunchuk. The result? Read on... All in your remote control We could start by talking about the incredible amount of teams present in this Fifa 08, each with licenses for players, sponsors and so on. But frankly it is now a practically obvious component when it comes to EA Sports production, given that it has always represented one of the prominent elements of each of its iterations. And while we're at it, we can also immediately remove the tooth and the related pain regarding the technical component, since Fifa 08 for Wii is aesthetically similar to its counterpart for Ps2. And so if during the action from a distance everything appears pleasant and sufficiently detailed and with a solid frame rate, it is unfortunately in the replays and in the close-ups that quite simplistic polygonal models are highlighted and a lack of technical refinements that are and will remain the prerogative of Xbox 360 and Ps3. Having said that, it is therefore evident that the validity or otherwise of the EA Canada effort is destined to revolve entirely around the control system; and fortunately the result is - although far from perfect - decidedly pleasant and fun. The Nunchuk analog is obviously delegated to the movements of the players, and the Z key to running. On the Wiimote side, A allows you to pass or change players in the non-possession phase, while B is for the through ball or defense for light tackle. So far nothing new, you will say. And in fact the original component appears when we talk about the shots, which are performed by moving the Wiimote up or down; in the first case for a strong shot, in the second for an accurate one. The wider and faster the movement, the more powerful the shot will be. The same action must also be carried out in the case of free kicks or corner kicks, but in such occasions the inclination of the Nunchuk also comes into play and determines the effect. In the defensive phase however, shaking the remote leads to performing a slide. As if that weren't enough, the motion sensors on both sides of the peripheral, this time associated with pressing the C key, are also used to make feints and plays, even if this aspect is much more simplistic than the one offered this year on 360 and Ps3. Finally, throw-ins are performed by replicating the movement, i.e. moving the two controllers close to the head and then forward. Confused? Well, in fact, during the first few games it is not easy to find the coordination and confidence necessary to obtain results similar to those of a traditional controller, but a handful of games are enough to gain familiarity and thus lose the initial embarrassment. And you really start having fun because the system studied by the programmers, both for the novelty factor and for the actual goodness of the same, gives Fifa 08 a freshness that is extremely rare to find in a football game. Having said that, it is frankly difficult to say that this solution is better than that of a traditional pad; the imprecision of the movement detection can be fatal and frustrating on certain occasions, and the overlapping of some actions with a single movement leaves room for errors rarely attributable to the player. More Fifa for everyone By default Fifa 08 offers a strange view, aligned to the short side of the field instead of the long one as usual. The programmers, at the time of the presentation of the game at the last Games Convention in Leipzig, had justified the fact by stating that this solution had turned out to be the one that went best with the control system. Fortunately this can be changed, since in reality our experience was different and even on Wii we found the traditional view much more enjoyable from every point of view. The perspective of the default one is in fact particularly inappropriate as regards the detection of distances, especially in defense, with consequent wrong slides or butterfly tackles. Furthermore, in general it does not allow a clear view of the position of one's men, a crucial factor for anyone who wants to obtain depth worthy of the name. But among the merits of Fifa 08 for Wii, the desire to make the product attractive and interesting to those whoany type of player; and so if the savvy user can enjoy a fairly ~classic~ experience refreshed by the atypical control system, even the absolute beginner can approach it without fear thanks to the Family Play mode simply by detaching the Nunchuck and thus using only the Wiimote. In this case the player is only required to pass, shoot or slide, delegating all movements to the CPU. An intelligent solution, and which at least can boast of allowing every Wii user to play an unprecedented game against his mother or grandmother without getting milk in his knees. Obviously in multiplayer games everyone can use the preferred method, between classic and Family Play. As if that weren't enough, the list of unpublished features of this edition extends with the Soccer Party mode, which contains 3 mini-games in which up to 4 people can participate, created using a colorful and completely different super deformed graphic style from the realistic one of the mode. principal. There is table football, a faithful reproduction of the historic bar pastime. The rotation of the bars is entrusted to the analogous movement of the Wiimote, but due to technical limitations it was not possible to do the same with the movement in depth, which was delegated to other keys or to the Nunchuk stick. Palleggi is instead, as the name suggests, a test of dribbles in which, in the manner of rythm'games, keys must be pressed or movements performed as indicated on the screen. Finally Kick Off, a series of penalty kicks in which you determine the direction by moving the remote control. All in all it is a welcome addition, even if hardly able to attract attention for more than a few minutes. Lastly, the online component should be mentioned, which rests on EA servers and therefore (fortunately) does not require the use of the much-discussed Friend Codes. In addition to the normal challenges, the ~Interactive Championship~ has also been added, in which you can take part in races as well as in the ~real~ calendar of each championship to raise your team in a global ranking. Absolutely acceptable lag and a good structure are therefore resized by the usual defect of the console in this field, or the absence of a voice chat which demeans the very nature of online multiplayer bringing it closer to a normal and less intriguing offline game. Comment Fifa 08 for Wii is the best football currently available on the Nintendo console. However, the futility of such a statement, given the total absence of competition on this platform, hides the positive evaluation of a product which above all demonstrates the programmers' will to create a title specifically designed for the Wii, and not a dull conversion from Ps2. A control system that is certainly not perfect but fun, various and diversified game modes and high accessibility for all types of players therefore make Fifa 08 an advisable purchase. Pros Convincing adaptation of the series Many modes and great accessibility Fun control system... Cons ...but that won't make you forget the classic pad Sufficient or little more graphics Online limited by the absence of voice chat", "date": "2007-10-12", "grade": null}
