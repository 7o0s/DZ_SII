{"name": "Rebel Raiders", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rebel-raiders.html", "text": "The game, piece by piece A real-time introduction, indeed ugly, projects us into the atmosphere of Rebel Raiders: the world is dominated by a military superpower, and the only ones capable of countering it are the soldiers of the Rebel Alliance. You impersonate their best pilot and, aboard different planes, you will have to complete a large number of missions (placed within thematic chapters) and challenges to achieve final success. A tutorial will show you how to behave in different situations, in offensive or defensive projection, after which you can launch into the action. Each mission involves killing a certain number of enemies, and usually one or two teams are then added to those already present in the area. Generally, your plane is equipped with a classic machine gun, a variable secondary weapon (missiles of different types, ~shotguns~ or other) and a special weapon, which can be activated by entering a dedicated mode. However, to unlock the following missions and/or the extra planes, it is necessary to complete the so-called ~challenges~, which consist in revisiting an already completed stage with some handicap (the lack of a secondary weapon, for example), with a limit of time or aboard an aircraft characterized by poor agility. In each mission you will be escorted by a certain number of allied fighters, and you will also have to look after their safety (the opposite practically never happens, mind you). The various phases are marked by the presence of Ace Combat-style dialogues, i.e. with animated images of the interlocutors (who speak in English with Italian subtitles), who have the task of keeping the attention on the story behind the game. Without success, however, given that the information provided is almost always superfluous and represents only a weak narrative device The problems, one by one Rebel Raiders begins to involve after a couple of missions, when you master the control system to perfection and you begin to enjoy destroying enemy planes after a long chase. Also having the challenges as a vehicle to unlock extra planes and missions is a good idea. Unfortunately, however, these are only the positive aspects of the game, which has evident problems in the technical realization and in the design (understood as a conception, in this case). The thing that most catches the eye, of course, is the absolute flatness of the scenarios: you fight by flying over mountains that are always the same, even in the textures, without other framing elements. There is no internship that differs from the others, in this sense, and we immediately try to ignore this enormous lack by thinking only of playing. The planes at our disposal and those of our opponents boast a normal construction, without infamy or praise; and the same can be said for all the other vehicles, large and small, that we will see on the screen. The sound sector is also poor, both in the effects (decidedly unconvincing) and in the music. As written above, the problems are also present with regard to the game structure: the enemies can be more or less fast, and it must be said that some clashes last for some time when chasing each other all inside canyons or between the wings of some huge aircraft carrier, but the only variation is represented by the procedure for avoiding enemy homing missiles (always the same). Comment The level of quality to which PS2 owners are now accustomed leaves very little hope of success for Rebel Raiders. The game is quite fun, but there are too many problems that afflict it and these days the margin of error allowed by the video game market has definitely narrowed. Casual gamers will be able to appreciate its characteristics for a few hours, but even they will soon notice the lack of differentiated scenarios, the repetitiveness of the clashes and, above all, the poor sensation of speed which should never distinguish such a title. Pros: Numerous missions, challenges and planes Cons: Desolate scenarios Missions all the same Repetitive combat Ace Combat represents the state of the art of ~arcade flight simulators~ (or ~aircraft action games~, if you will), and the release of Rebel Raiders does not change this status quo in any way. The new title developed by Kando Games offers a good level of action, together with a tested and effective structure, but it doesn't really make you cry out for a miracle.
