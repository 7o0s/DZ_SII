{"name": "WWE Smackdown! Here comes the pain!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-smackdown-here-comes-the-pain.html", "text": "F5 FURY! It is there for all to see that wrestling is now influenced by those marketing strategies that have always characterized EA's home releases, joining other (true) national sports such as the NBA, NHL, NFL and all the others at follow. Years ago, releases of this kind were not so frequent on other systems, you had to wait for the show to revolutionize itself and change its skin a bit (remember? WCW Nitro, NWO, WWF before WWE after); for some time instead the releases have been made yearly, constant on all 128bit home systems (Smackdown for sony, Raw for MS, and Wrestlemania for Nintendo). We often wonder where the need for all these releases from EA lies, given that in the end we find ourselves only in an update of both the player roster and the game engine, with marginal innovations if not in sporadic cases. Fortunately THQ is not EA and continues to follow the excellent path already undertaken with the previous Shut Your Mouth, amplifying, correcting, modifying what is necessary to make this series even more fun and profound. The comparison with its predecessor becomes necessary to understand exactly what are the novelties and changes made to the game system; since taken on its own, let's face it right away, this WWE is the best American wrestling game ever released so far. The feeling that pervades, after the presentation and the appearance of the menu, is that this time Yuke's has decided not to waste time with the frame, dedicating itself completely to the painting. The selectable options are the same (Exhibition in various types of modes, creation of wrestler-moves-revenues, season and options), while the really poor and essential side dish leaves a little displaced, spoiled as we were by those of the previous one. Entering the actual game, we cannot but notice the efforts that graphics and programmers have made to improve an already excellent product. The models of the wrestlers are truly remarkable, perfect reproductions of their real alter-egos. Excellently proportioned, enriched with photorealistic textures both on faces and on details such as tattoos, scars, veins, eyes and masks, but above all expressions. The animations of each character leave you speechless for the perfection with which they are made starting from the entrance of this or that superstar, up to his exit from the ring, or for their reactions to pain, moves, insults. On the same level are also the in-game animations, such as for holds, from the more classic ones (such as suplex or ddt) to the more complex ones (such as 619 or Last Ride), which have undergone an increase in frames and an attention to detail that it only adds to the sense of realism during the meeting. As a side dish, we have arenas almost identical to the predecessor, while the audience is more lively and numerous, increasing the emphasis of a television show. WHAT?! But it's not just the graphic and engine restyling of the game that leaves you amazed, substantial changes have also been made from the point of view of playability to make everything more complex and captivating. The grappling system has been expanded and scaled down; in fact we will have four methods to ~grab~ the opponent frontally: normal, fast, powerful and for submission levers, one for each direction of the pad plus pressure on the circle button. Once we have succeeded in this action we will be able to chain it to a real grip, by pressing direction plus circle key again. Doing the calculations we find ourselves with sixteen frontal moves, to which must be added those to the side, from behind, from the post, from opponent to the mat with back up or belly up and many many others for a total of about 50 and more moves per each character. In addition, the difference in values with which the wrestlers are characterized (strength, resistance, speed, submission, agility) is decidedly more marked than the predecessor, which materially prevents, for example, that an agile but weak wrestler like Rey Mysterio can lift that elephant from Big Show. Just as it will be difficult to inflict damage on mountains of muscles such as Big Poppa Pump or HHH who, however, will almost never be able to counterattack with locks or grips being slow and not very agile. In other words, the system has been made more simulative and ~realistic~, but still not free from gross errors that make you smile, such as the super moves Smackdown! which are always performed ignoring the ~physical rules~ listed above, but which absolutely do not undermine the playability. Among the novelties we also include the presence of damage to body parts (head, torso, arms and legs), resulting in limb breakage, instant knockout, or facial bleeding when the on-screen indicator reaches red. The counter system and submission holds have also been slightly overhauled, complicating things further, but above all the AI has been totally rewritten. Each opponent will tend to behave differently and in keeping with their style, personality and real counterpart, often making life difficult for the player and the challenge more varied and strategic. I'm the game... Even one of the most successful aspects of Shout your mouth has undergone changes. The season mode has lost its first-person view and the ability to explore the stadium and surroundings before entering the ring, instead appearing as a menu with various selections. Always present random and interactive interludes before and after the meeting, but we will no longer be forced to go looking for them as it will be enough to select them from the menu when present. We will be able to modify our fighter's profile at any time, enhancing it whenever we have enough points to spend, with which we will buy extras in the shopzone and obviously we will be able to participate in various matches as marked on the calendar. The identification and immersion in the world of wrestling is not the same as the predecessor, on the contrary, however, the events are more numerous, interactive and will have a greater influence on the main storyline. Given the complexity of events in career mode, this new look can only benefit them by making things faster and less random, however the same feeling that created the predecessor will be missing. Once again your task will be to emerge and become the undisputed champion of wwe, however, keeping in mind the rules described above, it will not be easy for everyone to make this dream come true, many will have to settle for a marginal role in the show or a belt second category. In any case, you will be the one to control the events and make the most important decisions, which will greatly influence future events when you least expect it (be careful not to push the rope too much, you could find yourself alone against everyone in no time). . Comment Without preamble, if you don't have any other wrestling game and you are intrigued by the genre, buy this Smackdown with your eyes closed. It is the best American wrestling title available in the market without a doubt. If you are a fan of the genre and you already have the predecessor, you should think about it for a moment instead. The technical sector is excellent from all points of view, from sound to gameplay. Longevity is ensured by a not inconsiderable difficulty, by a deep and technical control system, by numerous unlockable extras and above all by the immense editor even more complex than the previous titles. The season mode is fun, although obviously the pinnacle is reached in the multiplayer mode. So no flaws? Far from it. The loading times are still long and boring, the substantial changes compared to the previous one do not make one cry for a miracle, and one gets the feeling that things are half done in many respects. Perfection is still far from being achieved, but with this chapter we can put the Smackdown series! alongside Fire Pro without making either of them look bad. And believe us, many people have been waiting for this for years. Pros: TV show emphasis. Excellent graphic design. The editor is still a guarantee. Cons: Not all that innovative compared to its predecessor. Load times always above average. New fiscal year, new TV season for America's biggest show. Could the classic home conversion by THQ and Yuke's be missing? Obviously not, and here with a change of baton, going from ~The most exciting personality of the entire world entertainment~ to ~The Next Big Thing~, from The Rock to Brock Lesnar for the uninitiated, a new chapter in the Smackdown saga ! lands on our trusty Ps2.", "date": "2003-12-26", "grade": null}
