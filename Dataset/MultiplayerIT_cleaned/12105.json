{"name": "The Darkness - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-darkness-recensione_a.html", "text": "Jackie has two ways to defend herself from Uncle's henchmen, while wandering around a nocturnal and creepy New York. Firearms, obviously, which are not lacking in good variety and of which it is almost impossible to run out of ammunition, and the powers of Darkness. These increase with the number of hearts devoured by the bodies of the enemies who remain lifeless on the ground, given that the creature only accepts to tear the corpses to pieces, not even the dying beings like it. The first of the powers is the one that allows Jackie to control Darkness to crawl along walls and floors and to assault his opponents from behind. Passing through an unbridled use of one of the tentacles to turn off the lights and to impale enemies and two demonic firearms, we arrive at the possibility of launching real black holes, into which anything is sucked. The sense of omnipotence and immortality, that these skills manage to give to the player, is one of the most successful things of the game and, perhaps, one of its limitations, given that Darkness is certainly not impossible, even at the highest difficulty level. and given that the Artificial Intelligence of the opponents, even when you are in the other dimension, is not up to the capabilities available to the player. The only precaution is to ensure that the protagonist is always enveloped in darkness, where Darkness regenerates, and where his powers are unlimited. At that point, the imagination is the only limit to the ways in which to get rid of mobsters and the undead, who, whether attacked from behind or not in the way their limited reactivity makes them defend against attacks, often remain helpless waiting for their fate, not quite knowing how to respond to the player's moves. Even the Darklings, ruthless demonic little goblins, who can be summoned to help, end up being useful only for opening doors or for lightening certain really distressing situations with irony, given that they often stop in front of corners or dead ends without being able to attack our opponents effectively. The fact remains that the gameplay of Darkness flows fluid and exciting and that the many settings that can be operated on automatic aiming and aiming allow anyone to calibrate the gameplay perfectly to their needs. Once again, Starbreeze didn't limit themselves to making a trivial FPS, built around a series of more or less logically linked levels. They have, however, tried to tell a story, with at least a couple of breathtaking twists, by alternating pure action sequences with some adventure sections in which Jackie wanders around the New York subway, crowded with alienated characters who offer help and ask him to solve some of their problems. In addition to the main adventure, therefore, there are a series of sub-quests available to the player (some of them really satisfying) which, however, do not serve to deepen the story or to discover more details about the Darkness, but which only serve to reconstruct more accurately the credibility of a real parallel universe. It therefore depends on the player to decide to face only the main quest, which can be completed in about ten hours, or to linger in the alleys of New York in search of petty criminals and defaulting tenants. The reward is dozens of notes with phone numbers marked on them, which Jackie calls giving life to surreal conversations that reward a long series of extras to consult in the appropriate gallery, which is filled with unpublished drawings and sketches born during the game processing. The objectives that are unlocked will be a good incentive for the many who let themselves be captured by the atmospheres of The Darkness, others, probably, will dedicate themselves solely to saving Jackie, not finding enough bite in this secondary plan, which could have been integrated with more effectiveness in the backbone of the game. The design team has also included a multiplayer mode. The difference, compared to the campaign, is that each of the players, unless the options are set differently, can freely transform from human to Darkling at any time. In this last form, the player moves at incredible speed and is able to perform very long leaps and flying attacks, but cannot wield weapons. The maps are eight, rather small, and would host very fast, if a little confusing, clashes, dotted with continuous respawns, given that there is no waiting time before returning to the game after a kill. The conditional is a must, given that the netcode is affected by lag problems, which made most of the matches difficult to play.iti. The modes are the classic Deathmatch, single and team, Capture the Flag and Survivor, all quite explicit. There is also room for a curious note. With the default settings, it is possible to switch teams immediately before a match, making sure that there is no player in the other team. We have therefore happened to play games of Capture the Flag, for example, in which only one team ran undisturbed to take the flag of the other team, which did not exist, just to unlock the objectives related to this mode. It is news these days that Starbreeze is working on a patch aimed at solving lag problems, its release should take place in the next few weeks. Jackie's night is fascinating, disturbing, full of details and touches of class. Any light can and must be destroyed, to get rid of that annoying sizzle that underlines every moment in which the energy of Darkness is dispersed. And then, a golden cloak covers all the boundaries of the objects, emphasizing shapes that would otherwise be invisible, in a darkness that quickly becomes familiar and in which one ends up feeling perfectly at ease, in a unique atmosphere. The engine smoothly grinds any situation, without ever giving up the fateful 30 fps, with really defined textures and with some memorable situations, which are divided equally between this and the other dimension. The faces of some of the inhabitants of the subway will remain impressed on you for a long time, such as the feeling of having lived an experience outside the canons, thanks also to the great interactivity of many elements of the seabed or the animations of the darklings, when they on enemies by attacking them like crazy little clowns. Physics also puts its own into it, and between black holes and cars thrown everywhere, thanks to the tentacles, there is something to be surprised about. The dubbing of most of the characters deserves a separate mention and, above all, of the Darkness, given voice by Mike Patton, former singer of Faith No More or Peeping Tom, a true pioneer of vocal experiments that are used here to give life to a creature creepy and downright evil. A piece of skill to be fully enjoyed, thanks to the excellent choice not to dub the dialogues in Italian, leaving only the subtitles to illustrate the story. Comment We had huge expectations for The Darkness and maybe that's why not all of them were met. The Starbreeze touch is unmistakable, as is the attention to detail and to the mechanics and gameplay, which undoubtedly work. Too bad that the atmosphere of the game and that the characterization, really spot on, of certain characters are able to accompany the player for such a short experience, whose longevity is not helped even by the multiplayer, poorly developed and with lag problems that we hope will resolved. However, if you are looking for an engaging game, mature in execution and content, technically above average and made with great personality, we can only recommend The Darkness. Riddick's magic has not been repeated, but we are still in the presence of those sensations that only the best video games leave. The 360 and PS3 versions are very similar to each other, the choice is yours based on the console owned and preferences regarding the control system. Pros: Technical realization Atmosphere and setting Jackie and the powers of Darkness Cons: Longevity Artificial intelligence of enemies and Darkling Multiplayer to be reviewed There was great expectation for the new game by Starbreeze, a young team that made itself known from the world of video games with The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay, which here on Multiplayer has left us one of the best memories of the last console generation. After having literally devoured the beta version of The Darkness, we were finally able to calmly sit in front of the finished product, also in the PlayStation 3 version. The one where the story of Jackie, granddaughter of one of New York's most influential criminals, finds a worthy conclusion , who tries to survive the about-face of Uncle Paulie, who wants to eliminate him because he now sees him as a formidable rival in too strong a rise. Except that the uncle hasn't come to terms with The Darkness, an evil and fearsome entity that has been haunting the Estecado family since the First World War and will do anything to keep Jackie alive, or rather, to bring him back. continuously alive, as it needs a human host to continue to increase its power. The existence of our hero, therefore, will be marked by the continuous passages between two dimensions that merge into a single vision as fascinating as it is gloomy, in an attempt to learn more about the curse che afflicts him and the powers it gives him.", "date": "2007-07-24", "grade": null}
