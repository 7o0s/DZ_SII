{"name": "Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hextech-mayhem-recensione.html", "text": "Fast and fun gameplay In the chaos of characters that are part of the imaginative and colorful world of League of Legends, there are undoubtedly a crazy amount of rather original figures. For this Hextech Mayhem two of the most famous ~dwarfs~ of the cast were disturbed, namely Heimerdinger, an illustrious professor at the University of Piltover (lately seen in the Arcane series) and Ziggs, a mischievous bomber, obsessed with explosives (someone said Jinx?) and their destructive beauty. His love for explosives will lead him to destroy everything in front of him to demonstrate their magnificence and usefulness to the professor. These are the simple plot premises that will lead us to take a short ride through some typical settings of the Riot Games series and to jump between colorful explosions to the rhythm of music. The game mode is immediate and appreciable by anyone with a minimum of rhythm. Our good Ziggs will move running through the two-dimensional levels, trying to avoid any obstacle and enemy by jumping and throwing bombs, all obviously in time with the music. The commands are basic, we will only have to press 3 keys corresponding to the relative directions, respectively ~up~, ~down~ and ~right~ (all mappable at will) at the exact moment that the game time will command us. All the actions will allow you to obtain particular gears with which to unlock the next levels, the skins for Ziggs and the challenges with the bosses, or rather THE boss, always the same, but with increasing difficulty. Basically, at least for the first levels, there is faced with a very basic and simple gameplay, accessible to all without problems. The difficulties will come when, as you progress through the story, you unlock some advanced commands and above all you realize that the collectibles can only be obtained by carrying out hidden actions that the game (at least in normal mode) does not suggest. Technique and graphic sector As far as the visual aspect is concerned, the use of a well-defined color palette allows the game to have its own well-defined identity: explosions, particle effects and animations are very pleasant and the models, although low poly, are well animated and agreeable. The cutscenes are nice and the very good dubbing accompanies everything in a surprising way. The problem is, incomprehensibly, what should be the main strength of the offer, that is, that musical accompaniment that also acts as a co-protagonist for the entire duration, about 3 hours, of the game. Unfortunately there are no memorable tracks or with an important character. It seems that the tracks have been forcibly created around the scenarios to be able to keep up with all the abstruse turns of keys to press. There are backbeats after backbeats, sometimes it was very difficult for us to understand the tempo of the action, not because the controls weren't clearly visible, but because of changes in rhythm that we didn't expect. This does not mean to be a total rejection, the songs are still pleasant to listen to and accompany everything quite well for a good part of the playing time, but unfortunately they cannot completely break through the barrier between commands and instinct. Another problem, much worse, is given by the fact of not being able to enjoy almost at all the whole game outline due to having to concentrate on the tight controls. A great pity because in any case the work carried out is certainly of a good standard and in those brief moments in which we can get distracted to better understand where we are and what is happening around us, they make us understand even more than we would have liked more. Endgame Once the game is over we will have the possibility to choose 2 additional modes. The first will allow us to have all the commands on the screen, even the hidden ones, to be able to collect all the gears and thus bring the collectibles to 100% to perhaps unlock all the skins. The other is the exact opposite, a mode in which we will not have the visual elements of the commands available and we will have to go ~off the cuff~, which is really complex, for the whole series of reasons listed above. Surely, due to its brevity and its one-shot stage game nature, it is still all very fun and replayable. Too bad for these smudges which, with a little more care, could have made the game shine even better than Ziggs' best hextech bomb.", "date": "2021-11-20", "grade": "7.0"}
