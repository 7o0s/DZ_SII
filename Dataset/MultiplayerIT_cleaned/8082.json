On the other hand, what new and surprising things could one expect from a downloadable add-on for a game centered on the motorcycle trial discipline? New routes, methods and means, and in fact this is precisely the content of Riders of Doom, once again offered at the ridiculous price of 400 Microsoft Points. Crazy pain Riders of Doom is set in a location called ~Sabbione~, even if in reality, exactly as before, there is no authentic common thread in the setting of the different individual races; on the contrary, the Finnish programmers have once again wanted to give vent to their particularly strong imagination by designing bizarre, absurd, improbable and hilarious places of which we prefer this time to leave you the taste of the surprise. If therefore in essence a certain cohesion is missing as regards the setting of the various tests available, on the contrary from the point of view of the level of difficulty the common thread is more than evident; Riders of Doom is in fact an expansion dedicated mainly - if not exclusively - to expert users, who will be able to find real bread for their teeth in the contents scattered in the Sabbione. In fact, there are only a handful of tracks of easy and medium difficulty, then dividing most of them between difficult and extreme. And it is probably for this reason that the overall number of classic competitions is all in all modest, bordering on disappointing: only 20, but with a large portion of them destined to commit dozens and dozens of attempts before being able to obtain a better medal than the sad bronze that is guaranteed simply by reaching the finish line, regardless of the time and ~deaths~ employed. A particularly high level of challenge, accompanied by the usual splendid track design, which will please veterans, provided that this kind of player has not already amply satiated their hunger for Trials Evolution with the flood of tracks, even of high quality, made and offered by the community. Alongside the 20 races, 5 tournaments and 10 new challenges are also included. The latter once again demonstrate the flexibility of the RedLynx graphics and physics engine applied to situations that are completely different from the usual ones; we wouldn't know how else to define the race with a spaceship, or the throw of the javelin where, however, the latter is the pilot of the motorcycle, or even the challenge on a sort of roller coaster with carts attached to the motorcycle with squirrels on board, nice reference to that Nutty Fluffies for iOS made by RedLynx itself. All the challenges are fun, some more than others, and capable of engaging even hours and hours of play; nevertheless it is clear that it is an ~extra~, a welcome extra, but that perhaps more than one would have gladly exchanged for some normal additional track. Finally, to conclude the description of this Riders of Doom it is necessary to underline the presence of a new motorcycle, the reactive Banshee 350CC, very pleasant and interesting to ride thanks to remarkable but not brutal or extreme characteristics, such as to allow a more concentrated ride on the splendid track desing and on the need to tame the vehicle. The fact remains that it is in any case a much less original novelty than the BMX bike of the previous Origin of Pain, and we should not forget the impossibility of using it on routes outside the Sabbione, probably in order not to compromise the integrity and validity of the already established online leaderboards. Ultimately therefore Riders of Doom, also thanks to the very affordable price, proves to be an expansion recommended above all to Trials Evolution experts looking for high and demanding challenges; on the contrary, those who have played the RedLynx product in a less thorough and devoted way can safely avoid the download, continuing to rely on the community to discover new races.", "date": "2012-12-28", "grade": null}
