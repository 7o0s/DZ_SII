{"name": "Il naufrago sopravvissuto", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/178856-force-of-nature-il-naufrago-sopravvissuto.html", "text": "Force of Nature, released a few weeks ago on Steam, begins with the main character who wakes up on the seashore, after a possible shipwreck, wearing only a pair of tattered trousers: a fairly elementary preamble of which you will lose interest after a few minutes by entering immediately in the heart of the game. What is Force of Nature? A sandbox that tries to combine several genres: take a pinch of Minecraft in terms of resource gathering and the construction of objects and buildings, add numerical elements typical of the RPG such as values of attack, defense, resistance to temperature and regeneration of life and stamina (effort), enter levels of growth and quests and get ready to manage fields to cultivate and farmyard animals at Farmville. It doesn't end there, you will have to fight goblins, wild animals, ghosts and monsters; wear armor, amulets and explore a world made up of areas with different unique characteristics of flora and fauna in an exponential crescendo of things to do and to keep under control. All this is the game created by Russian developer Artem M Yatchenko and his team; unfortunately it's exclusively single player and, at least for now, there don't even seem to be plans for multiplayer. In addition to this, we will also see how, among the limitations of the game, there is to be considered a truly excessive demand for things to do that take the ~resource farming~, if only for casual players, to a sometimes frustrating level. If you've come this far and you're wondering if it's too much to create a smoothie of these different game genres, keep reading this review and you'll find out how complicated things get already after the first hour in which everything seems easy and rewarding thanks to a sense well done quest progression. Quests and many things to do in Force of Nature but always in complete freedom Accumulate, build, fight The initial impact is not the best, in fact the camera only allows us to go around the main character (who moves with the classic W, A, S, D keys) and does not allow movements in different directions or the slightest zoom, moreover , it freezes when we open the menus and the mouse arrow that is used to collect the objects appears (also feasible with the CTRL key without opening these menus); as you progress in the game you get used to the camera and this aspect begins to fade into the background. The game interface is well structured with 8 quick slots, in which it is possible to insert weapons, work tools and food (necessary to recover stamina and life) and with a menu, which can be recalled with the letter I which opens the inventory and shows the various body part slots for equipment. Under the equipment slots there are 6 important menus that can all be accessed via hotkeys, except those of the encyclopedia, which shows all the objects in the game, and the character characteristics panel, which we will discuss shortly. With the Q key it is possible to see which quests have already been carried out and which ones are still to be carried out, the C opens the manual crafting menu (which essentially allows you to build some objects anywhere and without using work tables or permanent workstations) while the B (buildings) opens a panel with various choices all aimed at building, moving or demolishing buildings and fixed constructions, whether they are useful for production such as hearths, anvils, forges, work fields and the like, whether they are decorative such as fixed torches, palisades , fences or flooring; with the M it is possible to open the map, rather stylized, in which you are identified by a red arrow while the terrain is visualized with a style made up of pixels of various colors which suggest the presence of different types of elements such as rocks, trees or easily recognizable enemies as they are marked with a red dot. Finally, we can not omit the Spacebar which allows you to bring up all the names of the objects that can be collected within a certain distance from the character (you will find yourself pressing it continuously given its fundamental utility). Going back to the character's characteristics panel, inside it has several interesting elements - also expressed numerically - which grow as the character's level increases: there is a value for the damage of our attack that varies depending on the weapon, one for the resistance to damage which instead varies with the armour, one for the life and stamina regeneration rate, one that indicates the speed of movement of the character and one relating to the external temperature and our tolerance to it (you cannot turn half naked in a cold area, on pain of death, and you can hardly move or exert yourself in the excessive heat). The alternationof day and night present in the game seems to have an exclusively aesthetic value and does not change the temperature, the same goes for the frequent thunderstorms. There is always something to do Force of Nature is built in such a way as to leave complete freedom of action to the player but always having the objective of completing one or more missions active. The first missions act as a tutorial, in fact, they ask you to collect almost all types of basic materials using the dedicated work tools: foliage, branches and wood from trees and bushes with the axe, soil, sand, clay from the ground with the shovel (initially a pointed stick) and the stones (of various types depending on the colouration) from the rocky complexes with an ice axe. We then move on to the missions to create the structures such as the hearth, the forge, the anvil, the workbench, etc... each of which has a menu that contains the objects that can be created inside it such as embers from the hearth, the ingots from the furnace, and weapons and armor from the anvil. When we try to place these structures, the game interface will change by dividing the ground into squares and coloring red those on which it will not be possible to place it; moreover, each building can be rotated and subsequently moved. There are so many buildings and objects and we haven't even talked about agriculture, cooking and animal taming yet: the quests also involve teaching these activities so, don't worry, because when you get to planting the seeds from your plantations you will already be familiar with the main mechanics of the game! Even wandering animals, which are caught using traps, work like structures and each of them has its own interface useful for producing various items such as wool from sheep (useful later to make clothes on the tailoring table), eggs to eat and feathers for the arrows respectively from hens and roosters or milk from goats and cows: animals, like you, do not die of hunger but they need food and water to give you back their finished product. Each object of the game is described very well so you will know exactly how much stamina or life a certain food will regenerate and in how much time (you can eat it while you are collecting materials or fighting) and, in the recipes to build them, you will always visually know which one you are missing and in what quantity to successfully run a product. As far as agriculture is concerned, it is necessary to create one or more wells for irrigation: these structures, in particular, automatically accumulate water up to a maximum of four units and then start accumulating it again once they are emptied. Water also becomes fundamental because it is needed not only for agriculture but also for animals and drinks to be created in the kitchen which are useful, for example, to get rid of the annoying deadly poisons injected by the variety of scorpions in play (all, in fact, damn poisonous) . The combat system is very simple and is the real Achilles' heel of this title (even passing over the fact that we have to collect lots of resources and kill lots of enemies to level up): when we use maces or swords we can fight at close range, the difference between the two weapons is that with the mace we cannot move by striking the blow while with the swords we can move allowing us to ~dodge~ the blows of the enemies. Unfortunately, dodging proves to be very difficult, the animations are very wooden and reduced to the bone not allowing any type of real dodging movement, moreover, the enemies often have an excessively fast rate of blows and it is enough to have two of them on, different from the simple ones initial goblins (who die easily), to risk death which punishes with the loss of random items from the inventory. Ranged combat is very comfortable and, once you get used to the particular aiming interface, it becomes very strong even though it doesn't allow you to stand still with the bow drawn and, simply, the arrow is shot on click of the mouse after an animation of few seconds, even if in the meantime the enemy can change position causing us to miss the target and, guess what... arrows cost resources! And wasting even one will really infuriate you. Basically, rather than learning how to fight, you will have to learn how to separate enemies to face one or at most two at the same time and this is really a shame. A retro style The graphic style vaguely recalls the games of the 16-bit consoles of the 90s (if we want, the feeling is similar to the one that Minecraft gave us the first time we played it even if, there, the call wasto the graphics of 8-bit consoles) but, nevertheless, it is very detailed, full of details and very colorful, and manages to pass from an arid and barren landscape to an explosive one of colorful flowers in a completely natural way. To this, we add a change of color and graphic cleaning with which we are able to see the screen which worsens as the wounds of our body increase, the same thing when we are poisoned or cold: all these color and sharpness variations are brought back to the normality when our health returns to safe acceptable levels. To appreciate the discrete variety of wandering creatures: there are many farmyard animals to capture, or many dangerous ones such as bears, foxes and wild boars and others directly from fantasy such as goblins, skeletons, ghosts, goblin bombers and, later in the game, golems of stone or magma. This multitude of creatures makes the experience very varied even if, every time you sleep, the map fills up with enemies again. Don't worry, from the first levels it will be possible to build comfortable portals through which you can freely teleport to a point on the map chosen by us. Each biome in the game has its own music track which transitions from ambient music to more upbeat tracks; in general, we can say that they are quite spot on while the sound effects are really neat starting, for example, with the continuous buzzing of the bees near the hives up to the crowing of the rooster as daylight approaches. Force of Nature is localized in English and Russian but it seems possible that other languages will be added in the future.", "date": "2017-01-18", "grade": "7.5"}
