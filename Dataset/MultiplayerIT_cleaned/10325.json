On their way, however, they meet a group of Eco Pirates, led by the cunning Captain Phoenix, who are also in search of the Eco and intend to take possession of it at any cost. Jak and Dexter manage to escape the assault, but realize that the pirates have spotted a huge flying ship to plunder it and rush to its aid. Once the danger has been averted, the three land aboard the Aeropa, which looks like a real flying city, and make the acquaintance of Duke Skyheed and his second in command, Chancellor Ruskin. The technology in their possession could create a turning point in the energy processes related to the Eco, giving the possibility to transform the mineral from its black and polluting form to the green and clean one. Keira immediately sets to work to create a device capable of carrying out this conversion, but to succeed in the enterprise she needs components and objects that Jak and Daxter will have to look for within the numerous locations that make up the game. Three times two The gameplay of Jak and Daxter: Challenge Without Borders basically alternates between three distinct phases: the action/platform sections in which we play as Jak, the aerial combat phases aboard the Hellcat and those in which Daxter transforms into a big monster and bad, facing mostly horizontal scrolling stages. Added to this are the many optional challenges that we can access by interacting with the characters on board the Aeropa. The control system in the stages with Jak as protagonist is immediate but full of features: the analog stick moves the character, while the main PSP buttons are used to jump (X), carry out a direct attack (Square) or ~rotating~ ( Circle) and fire the equipped weapon (Triangle). The L and R back keys are used to adjust the view, the management of which unfortunately represents the greatest limitation of the product developed by High Impact Games: the virtual camera does not follow Jak in the right way, forcing us to make continuous adjustments which during the fights are all other than easy to do. Not a small problem, to which is added an automatic aiming system with a controversial functioning, to which everything can be asked except precision. Jak wields a sort of ~scepter~ to defend himself and can combine his attacks to create more or less effective combos, but at the same time he has the possibility of using four different firearms (to be collected during the adventure) which can be upgraded along with the character's other abilities by spending money earned during missions. There is also the use of Echo, which depending on the color can give life to different and spectacular effects, lending itself to the needs of the gameplay to make situations always varied and engaging. For example, the Echo amplifier can be used both during some fights and in the exploration phase, to destroy obstacles that block the way. Similarly, the ~constructive~ function of the mineral allows us to create large crystals in certain points of the stages and thus create ~bridges~ or ~stairs~ useful for moving forward. From this point of view, the game surprises even after a few stages, proving to be truly inspired in some solutions and much less trivial than one might expect at the beginning. Eco-incentives The flight phases aboard the Hellcat are fun, but in the long run they turn out to be a bit repetitive. At this juncture, the control system refers to flight simulations, with the inverted Y axis for vertical movement and the X button which allows us to increase the power of the engines and therefore to enjoy an extra thrust, which is more fundamental than an occasion. The back buttons operate the spacecraft's weapons (lasers and missiles), which fire where the viewfinder is, and the stages are often enriched by quick time events in which we have to press the buttons in the order shown on the screen to perform certain actions. During one of the many chases with Captain Phoenix, for example, we will have to ~shoot~ Daxter with a grappling hook on the enemy vehicle and make sure that he can sabotage it on the fly to slow down its run. Speaking of Daxter, the sections in which he becomes the absolute protagonist (in a mutated, big and bad version, not surprisingly called ~Dark Daxter~) are characterized by very narrow locations full of elements that we can destroy, full of enemies to eliminate and small puzzles to solve(based on the activation of switches). In this case Daxter can hit his opponents in different ways and use up his energy reserve to transform himself into a sort of ~hurricane~ that makes Crash Bandicoot so much and that literally defeats everything he comes into contact with. Both variations on the theme perform the task of making the action as varied as possible admirably, but clearly do not have the numbers and depth to compete for the phases in which Jak plays the leading role. It is a pity that the game does not offer any multiplayer mode, but on balance it is a feature that would hardly have added who knows what value to the Sony product. Technical realization The graphics of Jak and Daxter: Challenge Without Borders are certainly excellent, really well done. Perhaps the goodness of the design of the characters will be questionable (it is still a series born in 2001 and never touched by a substantial restyling), but the direction undoubtedly lends itself well to the needs of the plot, with very well ~acted~ cutscenes both by protagonists as well as supporting actors. The realization of the Aeropa is very good, with an alternation of locations perhaps a little too similar to each other but characterized by a high number of polygons, as well as a fluid frame rate and not very subject to any uncertainty. The possibility of going around this flying city in search of secondary missions adds depth to the adventure, and in this sense reaching the hangar where the Hellcat is located and leaving for the next stage gives a good feeling of freedom. The external scenarios are also well designed but not very varied, with a typically ~cartoonish~ choice of colors and great attention to hiding the limits of the textures. The enemies that alternate are all convincing, well animated and have an excellent design, which is far from frequent in this genre of products. The view, as mentioned above, unfortunately does not behave at its best and ends up creating rather frustrating situations, sometimes ~getting stuck~ in the background and depriving us of the possibility of adjusting it in the best way. Finally, nothing to say about the sound: the Italian dubbing is excellent, the effects do their job discreetly and the music manages to effectively underline the action sequences.", "date": "2009-12-09", "grade": "8.0"}
