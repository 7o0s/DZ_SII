Matt Thorson is the creator, writer and creative director of the project: however, unlike what the company name suggests, he hasn't been developing games by himself for some years. Celeste was built primarily by six people, with a larger crew dedicated to improving the audio, as well as providing feedback on the design. And it is yet another demonstration of how important the individual's vision is, regardless of the size of the team. Celeste is ~homemade~, but it is also a very beautiful, ambitious and, unfortunately, sometimes pretentious game. Its protagonist is Madeline, a depressed and problematic girl, but strong-willed enough to attempt a mountain climb; a cluster that takes on obvious literary nuances during the adventure. The romantic topos of the setting is proposed which changes with the feelings of the character, which stands as a mirror of the inner self: the higher you go, the deeper you go. That, at least, is Mr. Matt Thorson's clear intent. So let's go and deal in detail with the two souls, alas often separate, of Celeste: the playful one and the narrative one. Climbing jumps More than from the evolution of the stages, and more than from the settings themselves, the idea of climbing ~something~ is given by the control system. Celeste is to all intents and purposes a two-dimensional platformer, but rather atypical in its focus more on the aerial phase than on the earthly one; this means that, for the majority of the time, and for most of the challenges, Madeline will be hanging on something, or having to perform stunts to avoid hitting the ground prematurely. Climbing is very satisfying on a tactile level, and uses a simple trick already enhanced by Donkey Kong Country Returns: in fact, to hold on to a wall it is necessary to press (and hold down) one of the two backbones, a functional and communicative action, which it really gives the impression of being hooked on to something, much more than it would have happened if everything had happened automatically, or simply with the press and immediate release of a button. Madeline can't hang forever - not that she slips right away, far from it - so you often have to think about which path to take before acting. The aerial phases, which represent the core of the work, as well as the backbone of the adventure, are dominated by Madeline's prodigious dash: a linear leap that can be activated in eight different directions, both from the ground and during a jump. The duration of this shot, the ability to recharge it, and the ways in which it interacts with the various elements of the setting, is what gives Celeste variety. It is a game with excellent level design, from the beginning to the end of the adventure: each chapter offers new ideas, which enrich the basic mechanics without ever betraying them. Here, speaking of the scan of the adventure, it must be said that in this game we cannot speak of levels in the traditional sense of the term: there are between five and ten chapters (we will not anticipate the details), each of them made up of dozens of interconnected internships. The setting and some research phases give homogeneity to everything, but one of the reasons why Celeste is never frustrating, despite the high difficulty of the adventure, is precisely because Madeline starts again - after a fall - always from the last ~picture ~ faced. Each idea proposed is developed and exploited in an adequate way, and Celeste never falls into banality. The hair-pulling sections are relegated to the ~B-sides~ of the stages, and are entirely optional. We have no particular criticisms to make in this area: perhaps there are too many independent sections dedicated to the collection of strawberries (collectable, but useless from the point of view of the main mission), the discovery of which can be stinging if you are looking for the main street. Perhaps the bouncing off the clouds could have been more intuitive, but overall it's trifles. Celeste will surprise you with its quality, its ideas and the ability to deepen them. Heart of Darkness We don't give all this importance to Celeste's story in an a priori way; it is the game itself that puts her in the foreground between one stage and another, presenting many dialogues (well translated into Italian, by the way) and emphasizing Madeline's emotional difficulties. For example, it is curious that in Celeste there are no enemies that are not natural obstacles or malign reifications of the characters' psyche: this is one of the more refined narrative elements, also because it is not made explicit in any way by the game. Alas other aspects of the story are not treated with the same maturityto. The themes addressed are serious, important, but sometimes they seem more selfish emanations of the creators than intradiegetic utterances of the characters; the speeches are not brilliant, and are often banal. ~What do you do to fight depression?~ ~Mostly... I drink.~ And this is just one example, a boulder thrown into a pond, and left to sink between two chapters of crystalline level design. Not only can Madeline's confessions appear out of place, but above all her alleged psychological stratification does not harmonize at all with the gameplay of the game; that the saddest and most demotivated part of her detaches and stands as an enemy is appreciable, that she starts shooting laser beams and breaks stones is simply... playful, and misleading with respect to the subject matter. Similar inconsistencies also emerge in the visual elaboration of the adventure, appreciable and cured in pixel art, almost amateurish in the artwork illustrated between one chapter and another. Even the sound accompaniment is valuable, but sometimes too tight: in the probable hypothesis that a piece is listened to again, due to the death of the character, fifty times in a row, it is not uncommon for the music to be alienating rather than adrenaline. Despite these uncertainties Celeste, like a great tennis player, manages to seize it when the big opportunity arrives: the last chapter of the game is really well done, from any point of view, and boasts a strong cohesion between controls, action and narrative.", "date": "2018-02-02", "grade": "8.4"}
