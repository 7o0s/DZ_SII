In a landscape dominated by war fps and a general rush to realism, the light-hearted puppets by Southend Interactive bring the aesthetic philosophy of Little Big Planet to the cerebral world of puzzle games. No concern for quick reflexes or skill with the pad, here it counts only the brain, the eye and a remarkable analytical ability. We have all the time in this world to finish the many levels that await us. The two stuffed creatures ilo and Milo love to sip a nice cup of tea together every day, but the problem is meeting in the world made up of cubes in which they live, so we need our precious help to make them find strength and courage! Two bodies, one soul The levels of ilomilo are represented by a labyrinth of cubes suspended in the void, with an increasingly elaborate shape as you go along. The three-dimensional development of the maps is soon revealed, through special cubes that allow them to be traveled along the axes. But that's not all, as the two characters can place certain cubes at will, to be used in specific contexts to conquer the passage. The player also has the option to alternate control of the two creatures at any time with the X key, thus taking advantage of a cooperative action to achieve the objective. Once the two friends are reunited, the level ends, moving on to the next one through a structure clearly reminiscent of Nintend. This means that we can repeat the same stage at will to recover the bonus items, first of all the very nice Safkas, little creatures who will have to be recovered, and who will faithfully follow our chubby heroes. But there are many other items that will have to be recovered, thus unlocking special bonus sections. Fried brains As the various worlds available progress, the formula is enriched by a growing series of unknowns, which make the vision and understanding of the levels more and more complicated. Among these we include special cubes that block the passage of the puppets, strange creatures capable of causing the most disparate effects, still retractable cubes that can be used as a bridge, and so on. The level design unfolds progressively, showing a care that is at times destabilizing, if not real flashes of genius. The greatest value of Ilomilo is, paradoxically, its main flaw, the empirical approach required of the player leads to somewhat frustrating situations in the advanced levels. The keystone is represented by the three-dimensional understanding of the maps; the problem is represented by the solutions to get to the bottom of the puzzle, which are almost never unique and are subordinated to the player's analytical ability. It's a bit like Rubik's cube syndrome, or the game of tiles, if you don't quickly understand the vision of the level, you run the risk of getting stuck, even irreparably. We already foresee a holocaust of neurons... Xbox 360 goals ilomilo offers the standard 200 objective points of Live Arcade titles. Most are achievable by beating the various chapters of the main game, or by uncovering the numerous secrets. However, one of the most original objectives ever seen so far is given an honorable mention, in fact, to achieve it we have to play the melody of the main menu, moving between the various items in time with the music! Own little world Technically ilomilo is a real feast for the eyes, with its vaguely patchwork style, which recalls a universally valid childhood imagery, in the same way as its simple and innocent incipit. In a similar way (and let's say, maliciously up to date) to the aforementioned Media Molecule brand, everything is represented by badly sewn fabric, bright colors and roundness that populated our childhood imagination. Everything is extremely relaxing and pleasant, in line with the game itself, also thanks to the sensational music, perfectly consistent with the context. Under the apparent cacophony of flutes and trombones that seem to be handled by a mischievous child, remarkable compositions are hidden that are instantly imprinted in memory. Every important detail is emphasized by some sound, care shines through everywhere, like the straw hats worn by the Safkas that we saved. The fully adjustable camera, as well as functional to the gameplay, allows you to fully enjoy the beauty of the levels. The title benefits from full Live integration for leaderboards, but lacks an online mode altogether, remainingexclusively relegated to local multiplayer.", "date": "2011-01-12", "grade": "8.5"}
