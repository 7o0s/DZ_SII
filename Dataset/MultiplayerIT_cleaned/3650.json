{"name": "Pathologic 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pathologic-2-recensione.html", "text": "Pathologic 2 is a difficult beast to tame to write a review, because it does everything to repel the player, to the point of being unpleasant and inaccessible on many occasions. A sequel to that Pathologic as defective as it is sublime in its poetic radicalism, it is at the same time a sophisticated reworking of the original text and a completely new vision of the thematic core itself. It was in 1969 that Luca Ronconi staged his Orlando Furioso at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, making theater history. Basically the staging transformed the spectators into scenography, giving them a highly active role, but at the same time limiting their fruition of the work, because the action took place simultaneously in different places on the self-propelled stage, which was continuously modified. If desired, the spectator could decide to place himself in a passive position, simply by watching, with the result of being put out of the show and, essentially, getting bored. In short, the choice was between an active but partial use and a passive but complete one. In the first Pathologic the player found himself displaced by a game world in which a lot was happening regardless of his presence. The combat system was horrendous, the problems abounded, but for many, wandering around the dying city where the action was set, discovering new aspects of it game after game, was worth all the suffering, even that of developing the awareness of the impossibility of fully understanding the game. Sick city Ice-Pick Lodge is very fond of theatrical staging, to the point that Pathologic 2 begins inside a theater used as a shelter for the sick. The player takes on the role of a doctor who has returned to his hometown after years of absence, to try to cure a plague that is decimating its population. The night before his return, his father was killed by who knows who and who knows why, while upon his arrival, he himself killed three men who attacked him as soon as he got off the train, immediately making enemies of part of the population. Let's say it right away: in Pathologic 2 nothing seems to have a logical thread, but everything appears to have a sense within the representation which, abandoning any desire to tell a linear story, is offered only in its fragmentary form, even depriving the player of the initial awareness of what he is doing. The streets and buildings of Pathologic 2 are full of events to observe, characters to talk to and situations to interpret. There is no real plot to follow, but you have to let yourself be guided by instinct, for example trying to investigate the soldiers who are raging in the streets, or making friends with some gangs of kids, or investigating the murder of our father , or still looking for an explanation to the scourge and why the ambush suffered. From this point of view we are faced with a title as intriguing as it is complex: each thread of the plot that we find ourselves following produces thoughts in the protagonist, thoughts that connect him to some character or to a place that allows the story to continue. The result is a dense network of thoughts, represented by a set of icons connected to each other to form a real narrative graph that theoretically indicates our progress. To further complicate the situation, the passage of time thinks about it, with the passing of the days introducing new stories and closing others, or creating intersections that lead some sub-plots in unexpected directions. Also, due to the curfew, the city changes enormously at night, adding more problems to administer and new stories to find. Note that the player is limited in exploration by the survival system, which we will discuss in the next paragraph, so he cannot follow everything. Luckily, roaming the city has been made easier than in the first Pathologic, thanks to the introduction of fast travel and a stamina bar that allows for short dashes. In short, reaching the desired places is much faster than in the past. The map is also much more functional, with clearer icons and a more precise representation of the city, divided into easily identifiable districts, which are highlighted on mouseover. To add other complications to the gameplay, the work of the protagonist takes care of it, called to intervene on the sick to cure or slow down the plague through a mini-game in which you must be able to prescribe the right medicines, mixing the various ingredients so as to try to obtain the right mixture to the case under discussion. In the beginning, action is taken quite often, but in the last few days resources are starting to run low and they aremany who inevitably have to be left to die. Also, sometimes you have to fight, especially at night, because of some masked characters roaming the streets. The combat system, still similar to FPS, has been much improved compared to the first Pathologic, but remains the weakest part of the game, at least at the construction level, based as it is on inaccurate hit and run mechanics. Most of the time it is fought with edged weapons or with bare hands, but there are also firearms around. But don't expect to go on indiscriminate massacres, because that's not the game. Here everything is extremely targeted and even the fights have their own narrative function, which makes us understand how much the developers have tried to connect everything and not leave the game systems as ends in themselves. For example, attacking someone for no reason increases the hatred of the entire district in which you are located, perhaps making it more difficult to obtain certain resources from shopkeepers and, in some cases, cutting narrative lines cleanly. In other cases our opponents do not go all the way to the end of the fight, but raise their hands in surrender, leaving us the choice of giving them the coup de grace or letting them go, perhaps after having robbed them of their belongings. Survive the system Another signature, if we want to call it that, of Ice-Pick Lodge is the pitiless difficulty, due to a game system that is punitive beyond all limits, truly odious in its desire to represent a kind of means of natural selection of its ideal gamer . But let's go in order. On the first day of the game, some long-limbed figures that we meet walking around the city explain the rudiments of the gameplay to us, for example telling us where to find water and food, how to manage the inventory and so on. In short, among other things, they introduce us to the terrible survival mechanics of Pathologic 2, which will probably make more than one player run away. In reality this is not a novelty for the Russian team, which already with the first Pathologic, but also with The Void, Cargo and Knock-Knock, has always introduced features of insane difficulty that can even block progression (think to the colors to be mixed in The Void). Incidentally, in Pathologic 2 the protagonist is always hungry and thirsty and gets infected. On the other hand, he also needs to sleep, but in doing so, hunger and thirst grow at a dizzying rate. All this translates into the need to constantly go around looking for medicines, food and water... with the impression of never being able to really satisfy all his needs. In short, in some situations the game seems to become a race against the measuring bars of the protagonist's values. Inevitably you end up dying. And die. And die again. Here the sympathy of Ice-Pick Lodge reaches very high levels, given that every time you are reborn you get malus, such as the reduction of one of the bars, which make it even more difficult to survive. The save system does not help: there is only one save location available which is overwritten after each death, thus not allowing you to avoid the malus. The result is that after a few deaths you can find yourself with the character reduced so badly that it becomes essentially impossible to continue the game and you are forced to start over. Worse still, this inordinate focus on survival gives the feeling that a lot of interesting events are being missed. In short, having to go hunting for food instead of investigating the mysteries of the plague is sometimes not exactly the best, especially when you are following a particularly interesting narrative thread. It's a pity, because in this way many will avoid approaching the game by missing out on its excellent narrative side, its masterful construction of events and the great atmosphere of the town, with its swarming of sickly figures, surreal characters and completely crazy situations . Of course if you have tolerated the other Ice-Pick Lodge titles you might not be annoyed but intrigued by such lack of mercy, but everyone else beware, because Pathologic 2 is a title that demands a player who is constantly on the alert and truly tolerant of certain idiosyncrasies.", "date": "2019-05-27", "grade": "7.0"}
