{"name": "Grabbed by the Ghoulies", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grabbed-by-the-ghoulies_a.html", "text": "Grabbed by Rare It begins with a presentation in perfect Rare style: a book that opens, many cartoons that come alive and a story that is self-evident that takes shape. The plot draws heavily on the stereotyped videogame narratives of the eighties, in which the prince, with the power of love, had to save his beauty from the clutches of a horrendous bad guy. Only that on this occasion the narrative plot, instead of tinged with epicness, will take shape in grotesque and humorous guises. Just think of the first screens portraying the perfidious kidnapper to understand what you will come across; screens where we will see the enemy on duty with arms wide open in an attempt to simulate an airplane, complete with lip effects to replace the engine noise. This is Rare! one might say, and in fact the multitude of details that recall the style of the Stamper brothers leaves little room for doubt in this regard. In the mansion in which all the misadventures of the teenager Cooper will take shape, the elements recalling the ~trademark~ vary from the usual self-celebratory ones to the more sought after ones. No prayer for the dying Grabbed by the Ghoulies is an all in all classic beat'em up, which has its roots in the depths of the dusty basements of retrogaming, without however forgetting to turn its gaze towards innovation. Specifically, the control system undoubtedly takes the lion's share, characterized by a decidedly original initiative. In fact, in the house haunted by monsters of all kinds, the player will fight using simply the two analog sticks: the one on the left to control the movements of the protagonist, while the one on the right to direct and execute the attacks. Certainly this feature offers the immediacy of hitting where and when you want, but the shadows that affect this innovation end up inexorably obscuring it. The stroke of a lever is much more expensive than that of any front button, this implies an excessive execution time between one stroke and another; we are talking about fractions of a second, mind you, but in a frenetic context such as the scrolling fighting game genre, tenths of a second can prove vital. Not least is the impossibility of launching into fine technicalities characterized by combos and special moves, since, depending on the direction and distance, Cooper will choose the most suitable move for the circumstance, leaving the player with the miserable task of tinkering as he could . However, the simplistic combat system is partly graced by the AI of the enemies, who will always try the most painful way to bring down the protagonist, looking for objects to throw or with which to inflict greater damage. Indeed, the background has a strong interaction rate, where both the player and the enemies will be able to collect and use the numerous elements present in the various rooms of the house. Where the streets have no name Lights and shadows, exaltation and repression. A few words that could significantly enclose the whole essence of this new Rare product. The first hours of the game actually amuse, they amuse the player not only for the clumsiness derived from the eccentricity of the control system, but also for the immediacy of a simple and, apparently, effective structure. The aim of the game is to enter a room, rid it of all sorts of atrocities and continue to the next room. If the linearity given by the perpetually guided advancement all in all does not disturb, the monotony of the situations proposed in the game brings considerable boredom in the player. Rare's attempt to add variables to a flat structure is of little use, when the combat system does not enhance the player's skills in any way. The British developers have implemented a set of rules in each room, which if not respected will bring the silhouette of death to the battlefield; inexorably comical, but still lethal, in his rock star animations when with the scythe he produces a perfect guitar solo. The limitations will change from room to room, going from the most classic in which it will be necessary to clear the area in a certain time, to the most original, such as the impossibility of damaging the furniture of the room in which you will fight. True colors Style. As already mentioned in the previous paragraphs, Grabbed by the Ghoulies is full of many small touches of class, supported by a lot of style and an iflawless. If the polygonal models do not record dizzying numbers in our theoretical polygon counter, the animations of the enemies and the protagonist are perfectly in tune with the light-hearted style of this game. Cooper will have a set of animations taken directly from the clumsiest of wrestlers around, while the various monsters that will meet along the adventure will present goodies everywhere. Everything is in the name of the most carefree fun, also helped by effective chromatic choices, so much so that Rare has stolen the crayons from the case of an English schoolboy by how soft and velvety the colors are. Even the creation of the game environments does not give up on the appointment with the visual goodness proposed by Rare, which, in addition to being maniacally detailed, offer countless ideas for interaction. The only not too positive note concerns the room, not always punctual and precise. Even the ear wants its part, and Rare is not wrong here either: the accompanying tracks are captivating, bordering on hypnotic; as well as the sound effects repeatedly succeed in trying to elicit a smile. True colors Comment Rare seems to have taken a very specific process with this generation of consoles, which sees it as the protagonist for the second time. Those who remember the farewell game to the Nintendo world, Star Fox Adventures, will certainly have found many similarities in what has been written so far. Grabbed by the Ghoulies is in fact a game that is more beautiful to see than to play, where the main gaps in terms of gameplay point the finger at a combat system reduced to a minimum and a linear but, above all, too monotonous game structure. This new effort by the Stampers is aimed especially at those who want to play carefree without having to activate the gray matter. GbtG can be an almost perfect Christmas present for a child, who will undoubtedly be enraptured by the recreated funny and grotesque world. Those who, on the other hand, expected a return of Rare up to the glories of the past, will have to wait at least until the next title. Pros: Technically well done. It oozes Rare style in abundance. At times hilarious. Cons: Camera not always reliable. Control system too restrictive. Linear and monotonous. Scrub clean, erased blackboard. So it would seem, to the eye of those who don't know what is still the most irreverent software house on the videogame scene. A troubled path, made up of a thousand small obstacles, brought the British house of the Stamper brothers, Rare in short, to the direct presence of Microsoft. A master stroke, nine in the hole and everyone to sing what was the prodigal son of mother Nintendo. Because there would be many praises to be given when it comes to Rare, it would be enough to mention that handful of titles produced in the past generation to immediately activate bizarre and at the same time delightfully pleasant mnemonic mechanisms. A stupid smile, a touch of emotion and go. Now, knowing the real reasons that prompted this celebrated software house to leave the roof of the Nintendo villa would be like coming into possession of the holy grail. The infinite assumptions, accompanied by the official declarations of the time, still leave some doubts open, and having this new Rare production in your hands does nothing but reopen doors that were apparently barred in due course. This Grabbed by the Ghoulies takes on the weight of starting a new journey, of archiving the past to embark on a long and, hopefully, successful journey.", "date": "2003-11-21", "grade": null}
