The developers of Spearhead Games, making its debut on PC and PlayStation 4, deliver us an action puzzle experience not only of quality but accompanied by impeccable direction, with many small touches of class to carve a simple and fun story, albeit full of implications creepy. The scenario is that of a secret laboratory, where a Russian scientist has created what, in his opinion, are the definitive forms of life: the Tiny Brains. Four guinea pigs born from genetic crossings that possess extraordinary intelligence and special abilities: Dax the bat can move objects with the power of thought; Stew the rabbit can instead attract them to him, sucking them up; Pad the mouse can exchange his position with that of his target, in a sort of ~double~ teleportation; and finally Minsc the hamster has the ability to create blocks of ice which can then explode and project those who are on their surface upwards, allowing them to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The combination of these powers soon becomes the leitmotif of the game which, after a brief introductory phase and having acquired a minimum of familiarity, immediately comes alive with the controls and catapults us into a series of rooms full of environmental puzzles to solve. Fingers crossed Within the campaign, the progression has been treated in a particular way, and in fact the first puzzles require the use of individual skills to be solved, while the further you go, the more complicated things get, which means that you have to join all 'ingenuity a certain dexterity and readiness. In some borderline cases, we will even find ourselves creating an ice platform with Minsc, projecting it forward with Dax and exchanging places with it using the power of Pad, all within a very few moments, thanks to a sort of bullet time automatic which slows down the passage of time in such situations. Fortunately, the control system proves to be up to the task, with the Xbox 360 controller being perfectly supported by the game and the commands arranged mostly on the back buttons and the analogs to calibrate its direction. A series of small attentions make some moments less frustrating than they could have been, for example the detection of collisions between a cubic battery and its housing appears deliberately permissive and therefore the question of millimeters is not asked, while the trial & error approach it rests on anything but punitive foundations, given that we have infinite lives and that even key objects are regenerated in the event of a fall or destruction. Furthermore, there is certainly no lack of variety: beyond the example we have already given, we will sometimes be asked to lead a large sphere through a path bristling with obstacles, pushing it and drawing it towards us so as not to make it fall into the void, until we place it in the his quarters and unlock the passage to the next room. Or we will have to defend a small pink chick (which will play a fundamental role in the story) from the attack of hordes of chanterelles, also finding an offensive value for our special skills. As? It will be enough to create a block of ice and push it towards the enemies (which moreover stands as a nice homage to the classic Pengo), or take advantage of the power to push or attract things to make enemies fall into the inevitable meat grinder. Tiny Brains is a very enjoyable action puzzle, especially in cooperative, but unfortunately very short Intense but short We have already mentioned the excellent direction that characterizes the Tiny Brains experience. The developers have given an extraordinary proof of maturity in this sense, packaging a solid product, recognizable by style and choice of colors, which does not particularly exploit the capabilities of the platforms on which it runs (on PC it is even only possible to select the resolution and eventual vertical synchrony...) but undoubtedly boasts a great personality and is capable of proposing characters and situations that remain in one's head, which is anything but obvious nowadays. See the terrified guinea pigs, attached to propellers carrying signs with congratulations on completing an internship, the telephone from which to call 911 or Santa Claus, the electronic pianola, the dialogues of the scientist and the computer he built: all appreciable contour elements, which enrich the experience of many facets. The cooperative connotation of the gameplay is also interesting, given that it is possible to play in four on the same workstation or online, collaborating to solve the puzzles in many different ways. What is unfortunately missing is longevity, consassumed that the campaign is completed in less than two hours. Of course, it is then possible to start it all over again in different ways, enabling ~friendly fire~ or using a single character equipped with all four powers, so let's say that two ~laps~ are the minimum wage for the adventure to be complete. There are also some extra challenges based on key situations like guiding orbs along a course, connecting devices, and so on. The fact is that such a short duration can only negatively affect the overall judgment, and it's a pity because in practice all the other aspects of the game appear very well-finished, with very few glitches relating to movement which will certainly be resolved shortly.", "date": "2013-12-16", "grade": "7.0"}
