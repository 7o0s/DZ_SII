The latter was probably the least anticipated and exciting announcement, even if in fact it is the first chapter for Switch created directly by Game Freak, the development house of the main series. The reasons are to be found in the clearly mobile nature of the project and in the type of monetization chosen, which immediately made one think of a poorly cared for and extremely simplified title. But will it really be like this? Or does Pokmon Quest hide deeper and more layered mechanics than expected? Let's find out together. Cubes upon cubes Pokmon Quest puts you in the role of a Pokmon researcher intent on exploring Cubetti Island, a mysterious area where everything has a particular shape, including little monsters. Just the artistic style is the most peculiar aspect of the work of Game Freak, which comes with squared and pixelated shapes that wink at Minecraft fans without hiding too much. However, the narrative is all here and, if we exclude some inexplicable malfunctions of an artificial assistant called Pokbee, the progression is limited to the continuous exploration of new areas and levels, with the aim of discovering and capturing the 150 Pokmon present in the area. The basic structure is in fact very simple: to investigate the life forms of the island it is necessary to attract more and more powerful Pokmon, exploiting an extremely simplified system of weaknesses that gives important bonuses to little monsters of a certain type within the settings of a certain area. The game map is then divided into sectors of increasing difficulty, where you face a series of waves of enemies before reaching and challenging the boss of the area. Even the combat system does not stand out for its complexity: after selecting three Pokmon to be included in the team and choosing the destination, the creatures begin to advance independently towards the closest enemies, engaging in battle at each encounter with a series of automatic shots. In these phases the player's task is to choose between the specific moves of the Pokmon at his disposal, calculating the timing of the shots to avoid missing the target and remain at the mercy of the enemy while waiting for the attack to load. Despite the apparent simplicity, the whole system hides an unexpected dose of strategy. In fact, before tackling an area, it is not enough to simply compare the overall power of your team with the level required by the area to be explored. First of all, it is necessary to equip the Pokmon with amulets, the so-called P stones, capable of increasing PS (Vigor stones), attack (Power stones) and effectiveness of the moves, with the addition of extra bonuses linked to the rarity of the same. Secondly, it is necessary to carefully study the composition of the team itself. The little monsters are divided into two broad categories, namely Pokmon that occupy the front line and Pokmon that attack from a distance. The former are therefore the tanks of the group and must be equipped to be able to take a lot of damage; on the other hand, the more supportive roles go to the latter and, in general, they are responsible for launching the most powerful attacks while avoiding enemy blows. From this point of view, the evasion key also assumes particular importance, which allows you to dodge enemy blows and to adjust the deployment on the field to bring the most resistant creatures back to the forefront. Scalene square In short, after a few hours Pokmon Quest reveals itself to be a deeper and more stratified title than it seems during the first levels. For this reason it is even more disappointing to note that the good game mechanics are undermined in the foundations by a certain approximation and by the free-to-play nature of the project. In fact, the exploration of the many areas immediately highlights important pathfinding problems, with movements made unpredictable not only by the presence of numerous obstacles, but also by a somewhat too random target locking system. Furthermore, the possibility of bringing the view closer or further away is completely missing, an absence that makes it impossible to keep everything that happens on the battlefield under control. Although it does not require the disbursement of cifexcessive re, given that with about thirty euros you can buy practically everything you need, the type of monetization then led to a series of unhappy design choices. Capture via recipes, for example, closely resembles the recruitment structure of many gacha titles. Cooking dishes forces you to complete a certain number of explorations not only to get the necessary ingredients but also for the actual cooking. The Pokmon obtained are then only partially determined by the recipes and this leads to a certain amount of frustration especially when resources are invested with advanced pots, given that the possibility of obtaining duplicates is always around the corner. Not only that: random generation also affects each creature's base stats and moves. While the latter can somehow be remedied with the right amulets, getting Pokmon with unhelpful attacks can lead to a real loop of dissatisfaction. The moves can in fact be replaced through a sacrifice mechanic called Sparring, which allows you to take advantage of the aforementioned duplicates to change one of the Pokmon's shots. Unfortunately, however, it is impossible to influence the process and you risk ending up losing a good number of creatures, many ingredients and, consequently, entire game sessions without results. Like any self-respecting free-to-play, in fact, even the explorations of Pokmon Quest are limited by a battery, with five bars that need thirty minutes each to recharge. Given the duration of each level, however, this is a limitation that is not particularly annoying. Then the picture is closed by some small performance problems, with unexplained slowdowns during exploration, and an interface designed mainly for touch, which makes it difficult to use any type of controller.", "date": "2018-06-04", "grade": "6.8"}
