After the catastrophic Amy, survival horror released for the digital markets of Microsoft and Sony three years ago, our darling returns to the scene with a graphic adventure financed thanks to a Kickstarter campaign where Subject 13 (perhaps a reference to subject 16 of Assassin's Creed, or more likely to the homonymous episode of the television series Fringe) has raised just over 40,000 thanks to the contribution of around 650 lenders. Numbers that do not make your head spin (of the various development steps only the minimum has been reached), but which have nevertheless allowed Microids to get to the bottom of this interesting production with a decidedly retro mold. The game opens with an interesting cinematic sequence, which reminded us of Sanitarium: a car sinks and a man follows it shortly after, who turns out to be the physicist Franklin Fargo. The scientist has decided to end it by holding himself guilty of the death of his fiance, who was murdered while waiting for him for an appointment for which he was late. To awaken him there will be the voice of a mysterious man, inside a sort of bathyscaphe, which will indicate him as Subject 13 and will lead him in the first steps of a complex research whose objective is not clear. Initially we only know that we are inside a laboratory on an island where strange experiments have been conducted and that our savior awaits us inside an Aztec temple. The echo of the past Although in the opening bars you play with a first-person view, Subject 13 is on balance a classic adventure that mimics the masterpieces of the early nineties signed by Ron Gilbert. From Indiana Jones to Day Of The Tentacle, without bothering that sacred monster of Moneky Island, or maybe even yes, considering the Caribbean setting of the second chapter. Much more humbly during the game sessions, a parallel came to mind with the little-known Thorgal: Odin's Curse, another transalpine title from a dozen years ago, also unable to revive the glories of the American progeny. The protagonist therefore moves on pre-rendered backdrops interacting with some sensitive points, some of which are maliciously positioned in areas that do not immediately stand out. As per tradition there is also an inventory where only the objects essential to continue the adventure are collected. Between one interlude and another, the narrative continues through dialogues in which the player plays an active part, having to choose between a series of questions and answers that are mutually exclusive and which for this reason add a minimum of replayability to a genre that traditionally it does not lend itself to being picked up again. The signing of Paul Cuisset led to a higher level of expectation Completed in a hurry The four chapters into which Subject 13 is divided provide a handful of screens to examine in order to track down the clues and thus have access to the subsequent scenarios. Some puzzles are really ingenious and under ~normal~ conditions would require a good deal of inventiveness to solve; however the smallness of the settings almost pushes one to go by trial and error rather than using the gray matter. Therefore, to prevent the gaming experience from turning into a furious and sterile click to the end credits, arithmetic / geometric sub-games have been added that squeeze the player's brains a little more, while never representing obstacles insurmountable, but at best tedious, like the exaggerated final minefield. It is a typical expedient to lengthen the broth when ideas begin to run out: already with The 7th Guest (born in 1993) insiders complained of the excessive similarities with the Puzzle Week; more than twenty years later, even more so, the same criticisms can be addressed to Subject 13 which can't even boast the science fiction graphics in FMV that sported the big title Trilobyte (one of the pioneers of the advent of the CD-Rom). On the stylistic front, in fact, the same ups and downs that distinguish the gameplay emerge: most of the scenarios are pleasant, but with some coarse details that could have been made with more care; even the polygonal model of the protagonist, well characterized, is not adequately inserted in the context, given that it does not cast any shadow andwhich in certain shots is not well proportioned to the landscape. Unfortunately, there are also technical bugs, with the character who sometimes gets stuck like a cod in the walls or in the trees, or clues that are not removed from the scenario despite having been collected. The soundtrack was edited by Olivier Deriviere, already working on Alone In The Dark and Remember Me, and does its job without particular blows to the heart, resulting in any case suitable for the setting. As mentioned, one cannot even speak of great longevity of the title: a period of time between five and six hours is what is required for the average player to solve Dr. Fargo's puzzles, while the more experienced will probably be able to get away with it even more quickly . The aforementioned possibility of repeating the title to choose different answers from those initially provided, precisely because of the heaviness of certain passages, is of little use. Faced with these observations, the approximately 20 euros needed to purchase Subject 13 become exaggerated: better to wait for better times.", "date": "2015-06-10", "grade": "5.2"}
