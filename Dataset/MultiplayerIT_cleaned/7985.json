Tomonobu Itagaki may not be the ideal work colleague if you are a beautiful girl, but his visionary genius is undeniable and has brought the series developed by Team Ninja to heights of unimaginable spectacularity, made up of clashes with giant Buddhas or with the Statue della Libert, as well as being synonymous with hardcore gaming. It is unimaginable to complete the game without incurring game over several times, faced with an often ~unfair~ challenge, given the amount of damage that enemies can cause to our character. A terribly fascinating challenge at the same time, however, because it forces you to master every technique, to use shurikens as a device to open a gap in the opponent's guard, to treat every ninja, monster or demon on our way like a small boss rather than a corpse that we will leave behind in two blows. Despite its defects, in short, a production of great importance. Landed on PlayStation 3 with the Sigma versions, the franchise has unfortunately lost its edge on the difficulty front (not to mention the purple blood seen in the second episode) but has been able to renew its offer thanks to the introduction of extra levels, characters and settings. It was then the turn of PlayStation Vita, with the first Ninja Gaiden Sigma to be part of the launch line-up of the Sony portable console but in a capacity well below expectations, in particular due to the halved frame rate (30 FPS instead of the original 60), a degree of challenge once again ~lightened~ and a bad management of the view. Not exactly an exciting starting point if the goal was to emphasize the technical capabilities of the new handheld, so it was all the more important to make up for it with the sequel. It happened? Unfortunately not. Poop agent The plot of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus sees the Dragon Ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, travel to Tokyo following the reappearance of the Black Spider clan, which aims to resurrect the terrible Archdemon. It is the special agent Sonia who explains everything to him, with her beautiful service uniform (what's up, have you never seen a member of the CIA in a sadomasochistic outfit?), and so a chase starts that will lead the protagonist to visit various scenarios around the world to find traces of his enemies. For us Italians, the stage in Venice is particularly suggestive, which for the occasion also has the Colosseum at its center and is controlled by an army of dangerous werewolves, but other locations also certainly deserve a mention, see for example the dark Manhattan and rainy, the same Tokyo of the early stages, the South American forests and finally the dark kingdom that hides inside Mount Fuji. As already mentioned, this edition of the game boasts a series of extra levels that fit into the single player campaign and see us control Rachel, Momiji and Ayane, three powerful allies of Ryu who we will also find in the supplementary modes. Let's immediately open a parenthesis in this regard: from the game's start screen we can access not only the campaign, but also the ~Chapter Challenge~, or rather face a stage individually in search of the best performance; try our hand at the fun ~Ninja Race~, a mode in which you have a time limit and you have to quickly eliminate enemies to gain a few more seconds; and finally try the ~Tag Missions~, in which there are two characters in action (one is controlled by the CPU, but by pressing the d-pad down you can make a quick switch) within increasingly more complex challenges that take life in the scenarios already visited. PSVita trophies There are forty Trophies (plus Platinum) present in Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus. Most of them are unlocked simply by successfully using the various ninja techniques that Ryu learns during the campaign, while the secret ones are linked to the completion of the individual chapters of history. Slow motion ninja shots So let's resume the discussion relating to the technical sector, which in the case of Ninja Gaiden is closely linked to gameplay and balancing. The series has always been very difficult but at the same time it has offered more experienced players various options to be able to successfully conclude a fight, for example by operating ~to the millimeter~ counter-moves during an opponent's lunge. The sixty frames per second of the home console versions were used for this, to grant us greater precision in these situations, those that ultimately characterize the experience in its most technical and profound facets. The halving of this value had already doneturn up their noses with the first Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus for PlayStation Vita, but in the sequel this ~inconvenience~ is unfortunately accompanied by further problems, in this case heavy slowdowns that occur on more than one occasion, both in the initial and central part of the campaign and especially when using ~heavy~ weapons such as the Blurred Scythe, which leaves large trails with each blow and sends opponents flying into the air before dismembering them. Anyone who remembers the first edition of Ninja Gaiden 2 for Xbox 360 may remember the mega-slowdown that started during one of the last levels, when Ryu had to climb a long staircase full of ninjas, but it was just an isolated and correctable episode compared to to an otherwise impeccable behavior of the engine and anchored to 60 FPS. In this episode for PSVita unfortunately things are not like this, the problem is not the single episode but a constant ~fatigue~ of the graphics engine, evidently very little optimized and also very little tested, because it seems frankly impossible not to notice it. And it's a shame, because for style and design the title of Team Ninja would still have a lot to say, even if by now the polygonal models and the ingenuity of some locations evidently feel the weight of the years. Thankfully there's been some camera work done since the first episode, but it's small compared to the product's technical shortcomings.", "date": "2013-02-27", "grade": "6.9"}
