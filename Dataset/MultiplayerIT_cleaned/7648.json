The conversion, at the time, was entrusted to Climax Group by a Blizzard who was still not convinced that their titles could be successful on consoles and the result, thanks to a control system designed exclusively for the mouse, did not prove to be exciting. This time the issue has appeared decidedly different since the announcement of the console version of Diablo III. Blizzard has set up a powerful media campaign and promised a control system worthy of the criticized but very good gameplay of Diablo III. A couch Diablo Diablo III is a classic three-quarter view hack & slash, a direct descendant of what many consider the undisputed king of the genre. Like the first two installments of the series, the title is based on a series of acts that must be replayed at ever-increasing levels of difficulty, with the last level repeated infinite times to find the best maximum level items. But even if the structure remains the classic one, a lot has changed with Diablo III, in which we find the skill structure distorted, now free from branches and prerequisites and based, in terms of effectiveness, on equipment and on the calculation of cooldowns (i.e. ability cooldown times). This choice has aroused a lot of criticism from many fans of the series, some of whom have complained about the excessive departure from the RPG canons, but the result, beyond personal tastes, offers intense tactile and visual satisfactions. Furthermore, the ability to change character abilities to your liking, combined with the constant patch rebalancing, generates that continuous dynamism in character builds that is an integral part of World of Warcraft's extreme longevity. All of this has been inherited from the console version of Diablo III even if the mechanics have transformed to adapt to the needs of the pad. The control of the character is entrusted to the left stick while the abilities are distributed on the triggers and the keys of the pad. The aim is inevitably automatic but, which is fundamental given the need to attack specific monsters in various situations, the player can change the target with the left trigger of the controller. In the transformation, some possibilities related to the mouse are lost, as in the case of the traps that are now automatically placed under the character, but directly controlling the Archon's radius gives satisfaction in quantity and it is not the only skill whose yield, in terms of tactile feedback, gets better with the pad. The result, thanks to an almost perfect command response, is excellent and is enriched by the addition of a free dodge available for all characters. This is not an addition that changes the game in a radical way, given that at higher levels the characters have much more effective skills, but it increases the physicality of the title, already increased by the direct control of the character. Furthermore, dodging makes the early stages of the game more exciting with monsters that cause more damage than their PC counterparts and, unlike the latter, can knock us down even in the very first levels. Ultimately, the mechanics of Diablo III in the console version definitely work and the excellent work of adaptation includes the menus with a functional mix of radial interfaces, information windows, automatic collection of gold and healing potions, the possibility of quickly equipping a collected item and menus integrated directly into the game window, such as the one for inviting players directly from a game in progress. A truly massive work that makes Diablo III one of the most intuitive and accessible hack & slash ever released on consoles. But before promoting the title there are several other changes to evaluate, important differences that distinguish the original version of the hack & slash Blizzard from that for PlayStation 3 and X360. We speak, of course, of the infrastructure, one of the most discussed elements of the PC version of Diablo III. The mouse isn't the only weapon that helps defeat Diablo The devil is in the details Diablo III on PC is a persistently connected experience structured around trading and selling items through an online auction. To enhance this component, which includes an alternative market based on real money, Blizzard has decided to make the characteristics of objects, even unique ones, extremely variable and has significantly decreased the percentage of finding unique objects compared to Diablo II . Also, the maximum difficulty still turns outquite high at maximum levels for those who are not equipped properly, despite numerous patches. For many, this approach has proved frustrating and the possibility of using the auction to compensate for the difficulty in finding the equipment has been seen as distorting the formula of the series. But this problem does not exist in the console version of the title since the auction does not exist and the title is playable completely offline. The drop system implemented on PlayStation 3 and X360 is not the long-awaited 2.0 revamp eagerly awaited by the Diablo PC community, but it is still less frustrating thanks to the increase in targeted drops for the character being used. In everything else, the console version is based on the 1.08 patch of the PC version and this means that it incorporates all the additions, such as the 100 additional Paragon levels, and the main improvements implemented by Blizzard from launch until the last major patch. Again, the difficulty can be further calibrated with five basic difficulty levels, two of which are to be unlocked, and as further help we also find the possibility of resurrecting directly on the corpse of our character. Finally, the console version of the Blizzard title allows you to save your character and transport it to other consoles, is completely playable offline and includes local co-op in four, complete with network support for those who want to use more than one console and one screen. Paradoxically, Diablo III on console is more faithful to the PC tradition than it is in the original version. And everything is obviously seasoned by the specific features of PSN and Xbox Live that add further body to the infrastructure created by Blizzard. If we add 60 frames per second graphics that are quite faithful to the original, although visibly not in full-HD, the picture that emerges, apart from some sporadic slowdowns, is definitely valid. accomplices excellent audio and interlude scenes that will not be up to the level of other Blizzard productions in terms of pathos but are qualitatively excellent as always. Unfortunately, some problems inherited from the PC version remain such as the lack of well-structured end-game content, the too cartoony tones that deviate from the beloved gloomy atmospheres of the series and the repetitiveness of the formula, a topical element of the genre but made more evident in Diablo III due to decreasing procedurally generated map parts. This means that many levels are always the same, to the detriment of the exploratory component. But the potential of Diablo III is not limited to the immediate use of content. Part of the value of the title is in fact due to the long-term support of Blizzard which includes a continuous evolution of the mechanics. A long filing work which, although it has not yet led to the results desired by Diablo II fans, has undoubtedly made the title more enjoyable than it was at launch and promises big future innovations such as structured PvP, a new drop system and some more surprises. Probably these innovations, like the first expansion announced during GamesCom 2013, will be introduced after their implementation on PC, but on the other hand Windows users have already been busy fighting the supreme evil for more than a year.", "date": "2013-09-03", "grade": "9.0"}
