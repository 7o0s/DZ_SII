{"name": "Attachesplughen!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68563-street-fighter-iv-attachesplughen.html", "text": "Tested version: PCTo the onomatopoeic cry coined in our parts on the original Japanese of one of its most famous special moves, a historic series like Street Fighter certainly needs no introduction given that its second chapter was able to become in the ' 90 a real institution in the gaming world, from which in the following years many other titles have drawn inspiration within the fighting game genre. It is therefore understandable that the announcement of a return with great pomp with Street Fighter IV was welcomed at the time with a plebiscite from the lovers of the old Capcom title, who, however, if not equipped with a console, had to wait until these days first summer to finally see Ryu, Ken and all the other historical characters of the series back on their monitors, plus some pleasant additions that bring the list of wrestlers present to a total of twenty-five, not all initially available and therefore to be unlocked by pulling a bit 'of blows around the world. To make up for the delay, Capcom has also added some new features on the game's graphics engine, which, as they say in these cases, never hurt. Very good new If in terms of game mechanics there is no difference compared to the console versions, on the other hand it must be said that the qualities appreciated on PS3 and Xbox 360 also remain intact on PC, making the old castration of the Amiga version of Street Fighter II: fortunately, as we will see later, Capcom has actually decided to give PC players what has been called the ~definitive version~ of the game, improved in the technical sector. Turning to the title itself, we can say that we find in Street Fighter IV a perfect amalgam of tradition and novelty, which will not fail to satisfy the historical fans of the series as well as the more recent fighting game enthusiasts, offering an excellent level of challenge (guaranteed by the different selectable difficulty levels) topped off by a longevity more than ensured by both single-player and multiplayer modes and by a depth loudly requested by fans and given without a shadow of a doubt by the developers. Hadooken! As we said, therefore, SFIV remains steadfast to the traditions of the series, proposing all the characters that made the second chapter (and derivatives) famous and their special moves, which can be performed today as then through the same combination of commands that we now know by heart, between charges, half moons and repeated keystrokes. Hand in hand with the historical elements we also find the interesting innovations proposed by Capcom, first of all the so-called Focus Attack, a type of attack capable of being devastating and even making your character recover energy, but obviously not easy to implement as you must absorb the opponent's attack and then hold down both medium strike keys, thus placing particular emphasis on predicting the rival's moves to launch one of the most powerful attack types in the game. But it doesn't end there, given that the Super moves seen in the previous chapters of the series are also joined by the Ultra ones, which can be performed unlike the Supers after having received a sufficient number of blows to charge the Revenge bar: certainly to be taken into consideration during a fight , given that these are devastating combos capable of producing a certain degree of satisfaction in the player. The longevity of the game is appreciated since the offline mode of SFIV, given that to complete it with all the wrestlers (and perhaps with increasing difficulties) it will still take some time, then going to unlock the initially hidden characters, obtained which will it can be launched headlong into games via the network, the real heart of the game and supported by the Windows Live Games platform, which unfortunately is not enough to allow PC players to start matches with Xbox 360 players, leaving both categories anchored to their system of game. From console to PC The biggest differences between the console and PC versions are, as we have said, in the technical sector, where in the first place we find full support for full HD 1080p (1920x1080 resolution) compared to only 720p (1280x720) seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 From the point of view of performance on the test PC, the game behaved very well in almost all cases, showing uncertainties in a single level of the game when activating all the graphic filters to the maximum, with a fairly low framerate substantial compared to the 60 FPS obtained up to that point. Abandon the few uncertainties of the console versions, SFIVmanages to switch from its historical 2D to the 3D of special moves with shocking naturalness, just as the various animations and visual effects are practically jaw-dropping. Another element not present in the console versions consists of the effects applicable to the image on the screen, probably also used by Capcom to make screenshots of the game before it was also released on the console: in addition to the normal filter, from the menu we can choose whether to give a touch ink, watercolor or posterize. Wanting to find the nitpicking in such perfection, the opening and interlude animations of the arcade mode seemed quite subdued, while also as regards the control system, the recommendations made when we tried the game on PS3 and X360: equip yourself with at least one pad, preferably a stick to fully enjoy the immense potential of this game.", "date": "2009-06-29", "grade": "9.5"}
