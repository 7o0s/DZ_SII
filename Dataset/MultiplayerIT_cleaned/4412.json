One of them is Wavetale, a new third-person adventure that takes us to explore a small aquatic world. Wavetale offers us a mix of exploration, platforming and combat. The game is available from December 12, 2022 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch. But let's not waste any more time and let's get straight to the point: here is our review of Wavetale! Water on the horizon Sigrid, the protagonist of Wavetale Wavetale is set in the remains of a city submerged in water. Only a few areas have survived and a handful of people survive as they can in these places. The greatest threat is soot, so thick that it darkens the air in the most dangerous areas. To disperse it you need a particular light produced by the Sparks, jellyfish that live out of the water and that we will have to collect during the game. Our character, Sigrid, is a girl who lives with her grandmother. The young girl lost the rest of her family during a past war, but now she has the opportunity to find out more about her past. It all happens when a big wave hits the city and brings with it a lot of soot, which obscures most of the emerged areas. At the same time, the water allows Sigrid to encounter a strange underwater creature that gives her the ability to walk on the sea. With this justification we are allowed to explore a small open map, made up of maritime areas and small islands where to recover the sparks and activate various generators that reactivate the current in the various areas of the city. In terms of gameplay, the bulk of Wavetale is exploration and parkour. The platform is the main genre, with a whole series of sequences composed of platforms and handholds on which to climb. The bulk of the movements is automatic, with the possibility of launching towards certain elements with the single press of a button. This makes the parkour sequences quite fluid and fast, but at the same time leaves us with little control. Overall we are talking about a very easy game, which tries to make every moment satisfying even at the cost of limiting the player's freedom. In all this there is only one downside: the camera is not always very good at following the action and can be a bit annoying. Monsters on the horizon The fights in Wavetale are limited and often skippable As mentioned at the beginning, however, one must not only explore and jump into Wavetale. During the adventure we will be faced with a series of monstrous creatures, piles of soot that have come to life. The combat system, however, is one of the weakest parts of the adventure. Sigrid has a simple combo, a charge move, and a fall attack, but not all of them from the start. But the truth is that the game asks for nothing more than a quick press to stun and defeat enemies in just a few hits. The fights are practically never interesting and the few bossfights present are in fact set up as platform challenges and not as hand-to-hand battles. Some enemies can also move on water in Wavetale The fights are an unfunny component and you soon realize that you can ignore most of the fights. Wavetale, in fact, does not give useful rewards for victory, if not a currency that can be used to purchase aesthetic elements to customize Sigrid's appearance. This currency, however, is available in abundance by exploring and therefore even those who want to buy every available costume would not really need to waste time with battles. Ignoring all the non-mandatory battles also has the effect of making the game much smoother and faster: instead of stopping every few minutes to do battle, you can go on and tackle the whole adventure as a parkour challenge, trying to go faster and possible fluids. It's good that it can be done, but still we can't ignore the low quality of the combat system. In the platforming stages there are also bouncy surfaces in Wavetale In narrative terms, in the three / four hours necessary to complete Wavetale, we will meet a good amount of secondary characters, not particularly interesting but useful for assigning us some secondary missions which are based solely on the collection of collectibles. It's nothing particularly interesting, but it can help increase the counter by a few tens of minutes. The main plotit is very simple and tells a story that focuses on ecology, the past and the desire to discover oneself. It's not a particularly exciting adventure, but it does its job and takes the player from phase to phase. What Wavetale lacks, in each of its components, is that extra idea that makes the game special: what we have in our hands is a small story that can be played from start to finish without a hitch but without peaks of any kind. Finally, we point out that the game also has some problems with loading objects on the horizon: graphically it is simple and pleasant, but the pop-up is very visible when moving in the water, which is most of the time.", "date": "2022-12-11", "grade": "7.0"}
