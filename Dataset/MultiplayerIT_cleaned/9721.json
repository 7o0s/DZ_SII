But, even before being a punk-rock fan with a nonconformist character and style to spare, Edmund is above all a brilliant game designer: captivating and often brazen stylistic choices, a steely personality and sometimes perfect and sometimes futuristic mechanics have allowed its Flash games to leave a heavy footprint on the indie developer community. When he announced the development of Super Meat Boy together with Tommy Refenes, author of the excellent Goo!, many were curious to see how a small game like the original Meat Boy would present itself to the most demanding console users. ~This is something totally different,~ says the author referring to what is certainly his most ambitious game, but it took us several hours, a worn pad and over 2000 lives lost to finally understand what he meant. Die Hard The heart of the game has remained practically unchanged from the original Flash chapter, as has its remarkable level of difficulty. The perfidious Dr. Fetus has once again kidnapped the beautiful Bandage Girl, and the player's aim, once again, is to lead the brave little Meat Boy through a series of very short levels full of deadly traps, in a formula that will appear extremely familiar to those who have played N+ before. No special weapons or abilities, then. The only way to avoid death, or to hit it in the face, is to run like mad and jump like hell, like even Forrest Gump on a pogo stick would not. In each level there are no checkpoints, but the attempts are endless: be it dangerous blades, spikes, rivers of lava, missiles or laser beams, the goal is therefore to reach Bandage Girl at the other end of the scenario, completing it in full without leaving the pens. And yes, just like in N+ and in the original Meat Boy, the traps are placed in such a way as to give a huge amount of trouble, often forcing dozens of attempts before passing a single level. Precisely for this reason, Super Meat Boy is certainly not within the reach of less tenacious players, yet the excellent progression of the difficulty and the gradual introduction of new traps make it difficult, but rarely frustrating. Indeed, the satisfaction of having passed a level is enhanced even more by the ingenious replay system: after passing a scenario, a single sequence is shown with all the attempts made. Seeing dozens of Meat Boys crash into traps, while only one, the last one, makes it to the end, is one-of-a-kind hoot. And what about the phenomenal work done by Refenes regarding the control system? Running, jumping or wall jumping are actions that are often overlooked or taken for granted in a video game, but which appear absolutely natural in Super Meat Boy: from this point of view, the two US developers have managed to create a 2D platform i whose controls do not border on perfection, but exceed it with flying colours. The Indies Manifesto Playing Super Meat Boy is a real pleasure, as is passing a level after a thousand attempts: we are amazed and exalted at every jump, at every misstep, at every trap set off, since each of the scenarios is a small level design pearl. ~One more try and then I'll stop~, we repeat to ourselves, but then we never stop. A clear advantage of the title is in fact that of preserving the simplicity and the sense of addiction that only a Flash game can give, while offering the player a complete and profound experience. But Super Meat Boy is also a wonderful encyclopedia, which unfortunately few players will be able to fully appreciate: with its numerous cameos, constant references and small homages, the game is a mammoth tribute to the lively and growing underground phenomenon that is the scene indie. Thus we find ourselves running between the icy buildings of Canabalt or jumping on the psychedelic platforms of BIT.TRIP, while the unlockable characters range from familiar faces, such as Tim of Braid, to icons that many are unknown, taken from fun freeware games such as Fly Wrench, Spelunky or Mighty Jill Off. Each of these has particular abilities, obviously inspired by the games from which they are drawn. Furthermore, McMillen and Refenes asked some of the best-known indie developers to create the so-called Warp Zones, secret levels characterized by a unique style to say the least: that of Phil Fish, author of FEZ, for example features 8-bit graphics that want heavily reminiscent of a Game Boy game. A further touch of variety to the classic game mechanics is given by the spectacular boss battles, introduced and followed by hilarious cutscenes: clearly, even on these occasions you will only jump from one platform to another, sometimes running away from a submerged factory, sometimes forcing huge sandworms to hurl themselves against sharp blades. The most fearless players, or the most masochistic ones, will be able to finish each level with the maximum score and thus unlock the Dark version, with a very similar structure but much more difficult. Unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to try the level editor, present only in future versions for PC and Mac, which perhaps represents the only real flaw of the game on Xbox Live Arcade: challenging friends in even more diabolical scenarios it would certainly have been remarkable, but it is likely that new levels will arrive in the form of DLC in a while.", "date": "2010-10-19", "grade": "9.3"}
