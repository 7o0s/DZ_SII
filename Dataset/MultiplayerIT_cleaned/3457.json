{"name": "Ghost Recon Breakpoint", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-recon-breakpoint-recensione.html", "text": "Carrying out the Ghost Recon Breakpoint review was not easy due to timing that defining narrow is reductive, even more so considering the breadth of an open world of this type and the need to analyze it in the most in-depth way possible, not only the news and the merits, but also the criticisms that arise, in particular, from its not being a courageous title. Because, let's face it, Ubisoft's premises and promises for this new chapter in the series spoke of a deep and interesting experience, characterized by survival mechanisms that were supposed to transform the caciarone shooter we got to know with Wildlands into something closer to the origins of the franchise, which was born as a highly strategic FPS. Instead, what is proposed to us in the game, after an initial suggestive phase, is an all too direct sequel to the previous episode which, however, has been removed from the offline cooperative vocation, eliminating the controlled companions by artificial intelligence, and added a loot shooter substrate that pushes you to explore any corner of the map in search of chests containing progressively higher level weapons, accessories and equipment. Story, characters, setting As told in the first hours of Ghost Recon Breakpoint, the story of the game revolves around an important corporation that works to improve people's lives and which has settled on a fictitious island, Auroa, creating a real paradise made of renewable sources, high technology and suggestive landscapes that alternate different biomes within a few kilometres. Behind this idyllic project, however, there is also a production of war drones that appeals to a former Ghost, Cole Walker (played by Jon Bernthal): together with his army of mercenaries, the Wolves, the man takes possession of Skell Technology and of the entire island, thus placing itself as a concrete threat to the most important nations of the world. Our character, Nomad (created through a not particularly wealthy editor) is sent on site leading a squad of over thirty men, but Walker's defense systems intercept the helicopters and shoot them down, decimating the Ghost squad and putting us in a particularly difficult situation: alone, wounded and in a place teeming with enemy soldiers. After an initial phase in which shooter mechanics and the importance of a stealth approach are introduced, highlighted in this chapter also by the possibility of blending in with the terrain, Ghost Recon Breakpoint involves us in a sequence of missions that can be linked to the main plot, to support the factions that move within Auroa or unlocked by interacting with the many characters we will come into contact with during the campaign. These figures are located within a generously sized map, divided into areas to be explored, each with a set of base camps (or ~bivouacs~) where you can move quickly and which allow you to take care of the protagonist by to temporarily improve specific skills, creating objects, buying them and leaving the camp at a pre-established time to be able to move in the light of the sun or at night. Compared to Bolivia, the new open world appears large but not very characterized: there are suggestive landscapes, red beaches lapped by water (very well done) and snow-capped mountains, dense forests and endless plains crossed by roads, but nothing that actually sticks in the mind. Single player campaign... Ghost Recon Breakpoint can be played completely in single player, if desired, even if the degree of difficulty of the missions is visibly higher than the aforementioned Ghost Recon Wildlands and the lack of companions controlled by artificial intelligence is felt a lot. The developers have rebalanced profoundly the mechanics of synchronized shooting, which in the previous episode allowed you to tag enemies with the drone and order the other team members to eliminate them precisely and punctually, effectively trivializing the conquest of the various enemy bases. Now this resource is available as a consumable, in limited quantities, and requires that you actually frame an opponent to be able to ~stick~ a drone on him that will explode on command. The management of heavy weapons, such as rocket launchers, has also been limited to a consumable, but in this specific case it very often happens that the mechanism jams due to a glitch... one of many, but we'll talk about it shortly. By acting resolutely, it is possible to flush out the guards, carry out aimed shots with silenced rifles, quickly change position to make peLose the tracks if you have been identified and start over, eroding the defenses of the settlement on a blow. Running into game over is a far from remote eventuality even at the intermediate difficulty level, but there's no reason to despair: when we return we will be able to resume with the eliminations from where we left them, given that the killed enemies do not respawn . In concert with the progressive unlocking of new skills, with the selection of classes and the continuous upgrading of weapons and equipment, completing the campaign alone stands as a perfectly viable path. The problem, more than anything else, is the extreme repetitiveness of the proposed pattern: you go to a place, you pass the guards, you interact with a character or you find a document that says that the target is actually from a other part, then you get back on the road and repeat the same thing once or twice. Taking inspiration from Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the possibility of playing in exploration or guided mode has been inserted: in the latter case the objectives are indicated automatically , otherwise you have to check the documents and cross-reference the information to understand where to go: a pinch of extra depth that can perhaps make you turn a blind eye to the lack of variety. ...or in a cooperative? The decision to radically change the approach compared to Wildlands and make the cooperative only available online, with companions controlled by other players, undoubtedly boasts great potential but also some edges that should not be underestimated. at the same time it is possible to carry on the story of Ghost Recon Breakpoint, wander among the many side missions or simply explore the map in search of loot while having a lot of fun and even forgetting about the many glitches that currently afflict the experience, in particular when playing multiplayer. We all get on a helicopter (still terribly slow: the feeling is that with a motorcycle the objectives are reached sooner) and we laugh seeing the characters sitting in nothing outside the vehicle, we willingly accept unexplained deaths , the constant slowness in the appearance of the weapons in the hands of the Ghosts, the projections in the air that defy any law of physics, the bugs that eliminate the noise of certain vehicles, the problems related to stalking (you lean out from behind a door, presses the left trigger to quickly aim at the enemy's head but the character aims the rifle at the wall) and an automatic aim that works poorly and poorly on PS4, unable to smooth out the edges of a gunplay that appears jerky despite the many sensitivity adjustments , with decent input lag and dead zones taking a toll especially during precision shooting. We were saying: there is no doubt that there is fun, but if you don't organize yourself with someone and rely on normal matchmaking, things take a very different turn and reveal the limits of the choice made by Ubisoft. In fact, it is possible to select the preference between main missions, factions, exploration and ~role-playing~, but do not choose the specific assignment if perhaps we are completing the story and need help with a particularly difficult quest. In case you have to communicate, propose, vote and it is not certain that in the end it will be done as we want, on the contrary there is inevitably the risk of getting some spoilers by accessing more advanced stages of the campaign than where we had arrived. PvP modes In addition to online co-op, Ghost Recon Breakpoint includes two competitive multiplayer modes for up to eight players, Elimination and Sabotage. The first is a classic team deathmatch with an added element represented by the progressive shrinking of the scenario, while the second requires you to take turns placing an explosive and defending your position to prevent the opposing team from deactivating the bomb. Both options frankly appear as a pure outline compared to PvE content, but can be exploited to easily obtain some skill points to spend on character progression, which falls within the perspective of a shared system. Progression, news and microtransactions As mentioned at the beginning, Ghost Recon Breakpoint tries to introduce some very interesting novelties on paper: survival and RPG mechanisms that manifest themselves in the form of physical resistance and debilitating wounds, to be bandaged quickly on pain of a substantial loss of mobility and resistance; a loot shooter-style approach that puts a lot of emphasis on finding crates, weapons and materials around the map; the approach with cooperational only online, which we have already talked about; a debuff of the drone and synchronized shooting for a more difficult gameplay, with less assistance; and finally a rather multifaceted progression system, which allows you to select one of the four available classes at any time (Assault, Shooter, Panther and Field Doctor) and spend the skill points earned on the field to unlock a whole series of improvements. If this last feature works properly and actually allows you to adopt different styles of play, all the rest unfortunately appears sketchy: the much talked about emphasis on realism immediately reveals itself as a largely negligible gimmick, but above all the enormous amount of loot available results in laughable increases in weapon effectiveness, so much so that two rifles of very different tiers boast very similar effects against targets and you have to really get to top loadout to notice any difference. This is an understandable choice from the point of view of balancing, because it is clear that significantly increasing the damage and / or accuracy of the weapons would have resulted in an inconsistent degree of challenge already after a few hours. At the same time, however, we realize that the effort of going around looking for new loot is not adequately rewarded, and consequently we tend to greatly limit our efforts. Then there is the issue of microtransactions, which inevitably has generated controversy and that Ubisoft handled poorly, trying to run for cover when it was too late. It is possible to complete the game without making any purchases in the large in-game shop, but doubts arise in relation to the upgrading of weapons in the more advanced stages and the rarity of the required materials: shadows that could further bury the reputation of the game. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty-one Ghost Recon Breakpoint Trophies are earned by completing campaign missions and specific assignments, unlocking all classes, and spending time on side quests. There are of course several achievements related to killings in various circumstances, including executions and headshots, as well as the upgrades available for the character. Narration, interface and technical realization If the story behind Ghost Recon Breakpoint is quite linear and offers very few surprises compared to the premises, the way it is told moves between ups and downs: the actors' interpretation in the Italian dubbing is technically good, but the dialogues appear lacks the emphasis that one would expect from certain situations and the audio design, quite essential, does not help. The quality of the cutscenes seems higher than in Wildlands, but the graphic inconstancy also plays a role in these situations and creates a very up-and-down situation . From the point of view of the in-game indicators, a good job has been done, given that you can choose to move without a map or activate the radar and information on the current mission with a touch of the d-pad. On the other hand, the interface accessible from the pause menu is decidedly less brilliant, which not only appears deadly slow and heavy in the operations that we find ourselves carrying out continuously (see the equipment adjustments), but also unnecessarily cumbersome in the management of the information that they accompany every single assignment, and which require our intervention (a simple gimmick, too, however) every time we come into possession of new clues in order to ~solve~ the riddle of the moment. The feeling in these situations is that the graphics engine makes a beastly effort, yet during the action on PlayStation 4 Pro no particular blunders are noticed, with the 30 frames per second which are maintained constantly, regardless of what happens on the screen , and two different display options to emphasize resolution or video quality, in the latter case using more sophisticated effects. This embellishes the surfaces with reflections and shaders that add depth and realism to the visual sector, and which let themselves go to an evident pop-up phenomenon only when we explore the map aboard a helicopter. However, the qualitative level of the assets is highly inconstant, and so it happens to pass from evocative and convincing scenarios to others that are much less brilliant.", "date": "2019-10-06", "grade": "7.0"}
