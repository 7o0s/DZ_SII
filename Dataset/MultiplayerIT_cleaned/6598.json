{"name": "Unmechanical: Extended", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/144355-unmechanical-extended-io-robottino.html", "text": "Originally made by the Swedish team Talawa Games and published in the summer of 2012, Unmechanical was taken over by Grip Games in order to package a console edition intended to run on Xbox One, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. The developers didn't however limited to a filing of the product and the resolution of any problems, but they have added an extra chapter to the campaign, with different protagonists, which can be accessed immediately on the starting screen. But let's proceed in order. Unmechanical: Extended is set in a world populated by curious mechanical life forms, a kind of graceful ~octopuses~ with four legs and a propeller that allows them to fly far and wide, as well as a tractor beam similar to that of the classic UFOs of vintage sci-fi films. They can therefore ~grab~ more or less heavy objects and drag them around, an ability that will prove to be fundamental during the adventure. Yes, because during a herd ~walk~, one of these beings falls into a trap and finds himself locked up in a sort of huge underground structure, whose devices seem to be controlled by a creature with familiar features. At the command of the robot, our task will therefore be to solve a series of environmental puzzles and regain freedom, obtaining two possible conclusions at the end of the story. Too bad that this does not in any way produce an enhancement of replayability, given that it will be enough to reload the last save after the ending to make a different choice and therefore witness the second ending ... of both stories. Simple and atmospheric, Unmechanical: Extended offers a thoroughly enjoyable puzzle-based adventure Short but intense? The original Unmechanical was released two and a half years ago, but the experience offered by the game is still current and full of a great atmosphere, which is the characterizing element of the product reworked for the occasion by Grip Games. The price of 9.99 euros appears adequate for the offer, which between the original campaign and the Extended chapter can last five or six hours, without ever really committing the player. In this case, however, the lack of a proper challenge is part of a precise design choice, and we don't feel like criticizing it too much: in Unmechanical: Extended there is no game over concept and there is very little backtracking, given that the puzzles take place more or less in watertight compartments, although sometimes the area to be explored in search of objects and switches can take on considerable dimensions. It certainly doesn't get boring, and the attention to style or even the basic but significant audio direction helps keep interest alive as you go from one puzzle to the next. If you really get stuck, however, there is a ~help~ function that provides a suggestion on what to do (in the version we tested, however, this function was not yet active). As mentioned above, the little creature we control can fly freely, enjoying an excellent stabilization system with respect to the inertial context, and drag objects using the tractor beam that emits from below. The controls are the simplest imaginable (the analog stick to move and any button on the controller to activate the beam) and do not change during the adventure, even if the robot at some point is modified to be able to move even under 'water without problems. This upgrade allows you to visit previously inaccessible areas of the scenario, even if this element has been exploited only marginally from a gameplay perspective. Xbox One goals The 1000 Gamerpoints of Unmechanical: Extended are obtained through seventeen anything but linear Achievements. In fact, to unlock them you need to carry out precise actions, which you will not necessarily be led to perform during the game, such as being hit five times by a lapillus while carrying a rock, making four inversions in the air, keeping an object in balance for ten seconds and etc. There are also the Objectives related to the completion of the two campaigns, one for each possible ending. Puzzles with style The ideas fielded by the original authors of Unmechanical are actually very valid, and it is possible to understand what needs to be done after just a couple of glances at the scenario, identifying the things that can be useful for opening a certain door or activating a device. Nothing complicated, as we have already pointed out, but enough to make the gameplay stylish and pleasant, so much so that we completed the campaign in a single session, without breaking a sweat butwithout even getting bored, not even a bit. Then we moved on to the aforementioned Extended chapter, which gives its name to the new edition of the game, finding mechanisms very similar to those used by the guys from Talawa Games but with a series of important innovations. In fact, the story told in the unpublished episode sees us control another robot, in practice a father (or a mother, who knows) committed to saving her little one, also captured by the devices of an underground structure. The action, in this case, often takes place in a parallel way: in the background we see our ~little son~ who finds himself having to overcome a closed passage, while we in the foreground can operate the switches that open those doors; or collaborate by pressing the same buttons in sequence, so that both can continue towards a possible escape route. We don't want to anticipate too much of the Extended chapter, but it seems to us that Grip Games has done an excellent job, in continuity with the original vision of the project; managing here too to push the atmosphere well and giving personality to the scenarios, always well differentiated, which flow fluidly and without uncertainties on the screen, in the splendor of 1080p and sixty frames per second.", "date": "2015-01-30", "grade": "7.5"}
