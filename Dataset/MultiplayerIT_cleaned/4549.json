It's one of those titles that, if you take it lightly, immediately slams your inadequacy in your face, asking you to do more. The starting point is FTL - Faster Than Light: Bomber Crew puts us in command of the crew of a bomber during the Second World War. Each crew member has their own specialization and can be assigned a certain role, which unlocks certain functions. The crew must be managed in real time For example, the pilot can make the aircraft take off and land and obviously can maneuver it, making it follow the indicated route and making it climb or descend in altitude; a machine gunner, on the other hand, takes care of defending the bomber by occupying one of the available turrets; while a bomb handler can drop clusters of explosives on targets, or even take photographs of sensitive targets. In short, each area of our aircraft, built in a more organic way than the FTL spaceships, requires the use of a human resource to be exploited. And this is where the good comes in... and the difficult. But let's proceed calmly. Military life Despite being a simulation strategy, Bomber Crew is an unusually dynamic title, which requires the player's constant attention. Basically it is made up of two macro sections: the base and the actual missions. The first of his is divided into a series of menus that allow you to manage men and means: for example, in case of need it is possible to enlist new recruits, or you can purchase more performing equipment, both for personnel and for the aircraft; or even you can customize our vehicle by purchasing embellishments such as decorations, new colors and more. Obviously everything has its price, which can be expressed in dollars or in intelligence (there are no microtransactions, don't worry). Both currencies are obtained by carrying out the assigned missions and are awarded in quantities such as to allow a balanced growth of our team, although they require us to make decisive choices, which have implications for the actual missions. Better a more resistant coating for the bomber, or is it preferable to install more parachutes to give our men an escape route in case of danger? Is it better to have an extra turret, in order to make enemy fighters less effective, or is it better to invest in medical kits? However, if there's one thing Bomber Crew has taught us, it's to never assume that you can overcome any situation by relying only on purchased upgrades. Finished with the management phase, you can choose which mission to take on in the briefing tent and then board the bomber. Don't get too attached As already mentioned, Bomber Crew is brutally difficult. The missions are all visualized in the same way: in the center of the screen is the bomber, which can be framed at different zoom levels (the smaller one shows the interior of the plane), on the left side we see the list of our men, while in the lower part there are the radar and the various functions unlocked by selecting the available resources. Our main task is to manage the staff in real time by giving them orders. You can unlock and buy different equipment for your crew and aircraft There is no pause button, although it is possible to slow down time for a short time if desired. Despite the simplicity of the control system, personnel management can become hectic. Imagine a typical situation: our target to bomb is in sight, but at the same time we have to deal with fighters that are on our heels and, perhaps, turrets on the ground that shoot at us without too much concern. Opening the hatch to drop the bombs would cause the aircraft to slow down, exposing us to enemy fire, but at the same time turning too much over the target would mean becoming easy targets for flak. What to do? First you need to adjust the course, then you need to tag the targets for the men in the turrets to hit (in both cases, just highlight the targets to tag them and tell the pilot and gunners what to do). Unfortunately an enemy fighter manages to hit our wing setting it on fire: we must immediately send a technician to shut it down if we want to stay in the air. Meanwhile, our machine gunners have run out of ammunition, so they have to be ordered to reload. Unfortunately, there are too many enemies, and we just have to try desperate action: we aim straight at the target and open the bomb hatch. Curse: the pilot was injured and lost a lot of energy, so we need to send him to the infirmary ehave it replaced by a non-specialist crew member (another slowdown). Meanwhile we are already on target: we have to drop the bombs. It all seems so peaceful, but all hell will break loose soon. Missed target. Adding insult to injury: the enemy fighters hit the other wing, which also caught fire. We have to put out the fire, but also reload the guns again and bring the captain back to the cockpit and heal the communications officer and... nothing else, since in the end we are shot down, the crew is exterminated and our mission fails miserably. In short, a great success. The ruthless! The previous paragraph don't deceive you: Bomber Crew is perfectly playable. It just takes practice and dedication. Sometimes it can be frustrating, but it can also give a lot of satisfaction. Especially the special objectives are extremely rewarding, because they are also the most difficult to achieve. For example, in missions in which the Dam-Buster bomb must be used to knock down a target, extreme precision is required, given that it cannot be dropped by remaining close to the ground as is the case with normal bombs (the aircraft can be raised to three different heights ). But when you succeed, usually after several attempts, you end up exulting in the throes of euphoria, as if something important had been accomplished. Even the plane is customizable It's true that some might be intimidated by the challenge offered by Bomber Crew, which can get really chaotic and unforgiving in some circumstances, especially when you misdirect the crew because of the camera angle and end up with a casualty on the wing or with the bombman in the cockpit (the FTL setting, while more schematic and less visually pleasing, is much more readable), but in general if you get hooked on the game you don't leave it until you do It is completed. Of course, it's not for everyone and a small interface overhaul wouldn't hurt. Maybe later. In the meantime, let's be satisfied.", "date": "2017-11-15", "grade": "8.5"}
