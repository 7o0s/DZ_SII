Tested version: Xbox 360 To confirm the quality of the Microsoft initiative called Xbox Live Summer of Arcade which returns this year with the 2011 edition, there is precisely that From Dust, which we have been hearing about for over a year now and which marks the return to the videogame scenario with an unpublished project by Eric Chahi. Visionary creator of the never equaled action adventure Another World and subsequently of that little jewel that responds to the name of Heart of Darkness, the French programmer, designer, screenwriter is therefore preparing to delight us with a project that completely moves away from his ideal of action adventure by proposing a purely strategic gameplay with a strong god game imprint. For those who have at least twenty years of gamer experience behind them, the most fitting example is Populous, the ingenious and historic creature of Peter Molyneux at the time of Bullfrog. For all the other readers, we will try to explain in the following paragraphs what the new game produced by Ubisoft Montpellier is about, which has aroused so much curiosity in recent months and which finally arrives on Xbox Live Arcade at the price of 1200 Microsoft points (about 14 euros). PC gamers will have to wait until mid-August while for PlayStation 3 owners the wait is getting longer as there is still no precise release date. Apparent simplicity From Dust is to all intents and purposes a real-time strategy where, however, there is no direct management of the units, in this case represented by some savages who can be organized into small tribes, but only of the elements that make up the scenario. The population is left to its free will and the indications that we can give them are absolutely basic. Hence the definition of god game: we are real gods and our power is entirely focused on the morphological management of the playing area. Our aim will be to guide the tribes through a skimpy narrative plot that will be told to us during our pilgrimage along thirteen islands, capturing and building a small village around each totem on the map: usually no more than four. Once this is done we will have access to a portal which, once reached by some exponents of our population, will allow us to abandon the current strip of land and land in a new territory. That's all: there will be no enemies to face, structures to build or forces to train; the challenge is completely reversed in the management of the natural elements so that our tribes are safe from natural disasters and can reach the totems, the stones and the portal scattered around the islet. What we will be able to do by commanding our divine avatar is to send some members of our tribe to conquer totems and stones and to collect and deposit the three elements that make up the playing area: water, sand and lava. By combining them we will be able to alter the morphology of the scenario and in this way create passages for our tribe, dams to change the course of rivers, real mountain ranges to stem volcanic eruptions and so on. Each island can be modified to our liking by paying attention to the only two limitations: the rock that cannot be moved or altered for most of the game (only in the more advanced levels will we have a small trick at our disposal) and the sea that surrounds each island and which acts as a border to our creations. It will therefore be up to us to indicate to the tribe which totem to conquer and immediately follow the movements of the population to eliminate any physical obstacle. Soon, however, the situation will become more complicated with the introduction of natural catastrophes: tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and floods which will periodically upset the natural rhythm of the island faced, forcing the player to adequately reflect on the morphological changes to be made, on the movements to be made tribe and above all they will oblige him to accurately manage the dead times that elapse between each manifestation of the cataclysm. From Dust gently guides the player through an increasingly steep difficulty curve: even if it is not possible to choose the challenge rate, each island is always slightly more difficult than the previous one and introduces a new element ready to mix the cards on the table and to offer a new element of reflection as in the best of puzzle games. The advent of the cataclysms will be counterbalanced by the stones of knowledge that can be studied by a savage to learn two different knowledge that will first be transmitted to a totem and then to the relative village to then bedistributed to all other settlements. We will therefore have the water repelling power to defend buildings from tsunamis and the lava repelling power to contrast volcanic eruptions: in both cases what we will see appearing will be a sort of divine shield evoked to the sound of music and capable of literally diverting the course of natural disasters . Xbox 360 goals From Dust offers the classic 12 objectives for a total of 200 points typical of Xbox 360 marketplace DLCs. A small part of these are dedicated to completing the campaign and the same number concern in-game interactions such as a certain number of uprooted trees or a certain amount of collected lava. Closes the collection a handful of objectives that stimulates the player to collect all the collectibles to complete the knowledge of the tribe and to face, solving all the challenges. More strategic or more puzzle game? In the advanced game we will discover that we also have to deal with the powers of the totems and with three different types of vegetation. Let's start from the first: by conquering the totemic sculptures we will have access to real super powers that can be activated by pressing the digital arrows and which will remain active for a few seconds, heavily altering some aspects of the gameplay. We pass from powers that block water by freezing it, to others that vaporize it, passing through the possibility of temporarily increasing the quantity of matter collected by yearning, our avatar, the faculty of creating infinite earth or even of sucking up, destroying it, any type of matter. In the more advanced islands we will then have to deal with some trees capable of emitting flames, others that can suck water from the subsoil and then ~unload~ it if endangered by the fire. And yet an explosive bush capable of exploding, destroying even rocks if subjected to heat. As mentioned above, in the work of Eric Chahi there never seem to be a lack of elements of novelty during the entire peregrination through the 13 islands but, and here lies the first main criticism, the player's actions will always and only be limited to management of the three natural elements with minimal deviations on the theme represented for example by the trees mentioned above. Deviations that occur, among other things, in the last game scenarios. A few attempts and experiments will be enough to immediately realize what needs to be done in the scenario to resolve the increasingly intricate situation, so it will only be a question of moving earth to the right place, and keeping water flows and lava outflows under control. On balance, the danger of boredom never really arises and the longevity of the campaign helps in this sense since it will hardly be able to keep you busy for more than 7-8 hours; however in the second part of the game the lack of novelty in the possible interactions becomes increasingly evident and this weighs on the quality of the challenge offered to the player. Pleasant addition of outline are the collectibles represented by some stones that must be discovered in the play area and then studied by the savages and by the management of the vegetation. Our villages are in fact able to grow trees and meadows by stimulating their slow extension on the parts of the island covered with sand. But be careful because more vegetation means a greater possibility of spreading the flames. Based on the percentage of land covered with greenery and discovered stones, we will be able to unlock the knowledge of the tribe and the challenges. The first represents the lore of the game and describes all the elements of the universe created by Ubisoft Montpellier using biblical language. The challenges, thirty in all, are a pleasant diversion: mini puzzles where the player is forced to carry out a certain task in a time limit by properly managing a whole series of imposed limitations. For example, we will have to be able to transport 10 savages from one totem to another by sucking only water from the rivers that hinder their path. Or we will have to keep a volcanic eruption at bay by managing only sand for the time necessary to make our villages learn the knowledge of repelling and so on. We will then be able to compare our times with those of friends and other online players through a rather in-depth system of rankings. The addition is interesting but in our opinion a sort of internal editor to shape an island to your liking would have been even more interesting, perhaps leaving the player the freedom to devote himself to a sort of free sandbox within the gaming experience. Especially nice to listen to On a technical level From Dust presents itself rather fluctuating even if generally always very ppleasant. If on the one hand we have in fact textures and above all rather standard models such as resolution and animations, accompanied by a general lack of detail in the game scenes, especially in the distant view, on the other hand we have the magnificent management of liquids and materials which, especially in the presence of cataclysms, they strongly show the excellent level of physics simulation achieved by Ubisoft Montpellier. What leaves you most puzzled is the management of the camera. In fact, the game is controlled in a rather classic way thanks to the two analogs: the left to move the selection cursor and move the camera as it approaches the edges and the right to rotate the view. The problem is in the management of the zoom or, better to say, in its almost absence. In From Dust it will in fact be possible to have a close-up view with an isometric inclination or a bird's eye view and a shot from the distance blocked on the isometric orientation. There is therefore no possibility to choose different zoom levels, let alone manage the inclination on the vertical axis of the camera. This limit imposed on the player will have some consequences on the more advanced stages of the game where in some situations, those in which the arrangement of earth and lava must be painstakingly managed, both views are not particularly comfortable. The title is then subtitled in Italian and offers a dubbing in a fictitious and ancient language while from a musical point of view it is certainly very pleasant to note the original work done by the developer. In fact, a real sound accompaniment is missing but most of the actions of the tribes and of our avatar, in particular when the powers are activated, are underlined by tribal rhythms and small musical cues that forcefully show the care taken by Eric Chahi in all the game elements.", "date": "2011-07-26", "grade": "8.6"}
