{"name": "World Poker Tour: Texas Hold 'Em 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-poker-tour-texas-hold-em-2.html", "text": "During a few sleepless nights, zapping, you will have happened to watch a game of the so-called ~sports poker~, probably the most truthful interpretation of the classic card game as well as the official one, in the sense that the tournaments take place inside a federation very similar to those present for sports in the strict sense. This type of poker is played on large tables around which up to six players sit at the same time: in each hand you pay your share of the pot and receive only two cards, then you start a round of moves which leads to the discovery of five cards from the dealer. It is by adding the latter with ours that one determines one's score and one can decide to behave accordingly, i.e. bet strongly (even all the capital) or go ahead by spending as little as possible, or even organize a bluff with the aim of making him give up other players before inevitably being caught. World Poker Tour: Texas Hold 'Em 2 offers us sports poker, giving us the possibility of accessing two different modes: the quick game, with rules that we decide (number of players, pot, maximum bet, duration, etc.) , or the scenario, or the participation in tournaments first of a national and then global level. If the quick game has the advantage of making us understand immediately how to play and what the level of artificial intelligence is, it is the scenario mode that represents the most substantial part of the game. In fact, our character will have to impose his skill in official events, passing from the qualifying stages to the final stages of the tournaments. The main objective is to eliminate the other five competitors, and if succeeding in the enterprise at the beginning will be moderately simple, later it will turn into a deadly and exciting challenge. To get rid of a player you have to let him run out of money, and you can resort to different strategies: we will rarely have good cards in hand right away, so at the beginning we will have to risk and see what the dealer comes up with, then decide whether to quit or continue, and how to do so. In this sense, the game behaves very well and is really realistic and plausible, with our opponents also able to orchestrate colossal bluffs as well as to bite our traps: betting the maximum after the dealer has shown some cards can induce the others to fold and let us win the pot, even if we have nothing. As with any poker game, the technical implementation of WPT: Texas Hold 'Em 2 is pretty basic but it works very well. The graphics only show a portion of the gameboard, with the view quickly scrolling to show us the missing section. The players are always the same, unfortunately, and have extremely limited animation. In general, however, we can't complain as the most important things are done well: the view of the cards is always clear, the options are arranged so as to be immediately visible and the interface is well studied and effective. The sound sector does not shine in quantity, but boasts a series of sampled phrases and supports the game action in a worthy way. Finally, as regards the control system, you only need to maneuver the joystick and the FIRE button (or 5 on the numeric pad) to play: nothing could be simpler.
