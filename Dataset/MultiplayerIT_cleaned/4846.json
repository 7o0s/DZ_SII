Can they really teach anything? Birthdays the Beginnings tries to give an affirmative answer to these questions, bringing a sort of simplified evolution guide to consoles and PCs which could however also be interesting from an educational point of view. The new production by Yasuhiro Wada (the father of Harvest Moon) does his best not to seem boring and right from the start it presents itself with captivating characters and a cuddly design, specifically designed to stimulate the imagination of young Darwins ready to try their hand at the title. However, something breaks quite quickly reducing everything to a mere formal exercise, forgetting that the primary purpose should be to entertain and amuse. The cute dinosaurs are not enough to support a production with gameplay that is really too shallow I love you Denver Arc System Works and Toybox do not want to leave us alone while we create life and on first access we will immediately meet Navi a small mascot who will guide us step by step as the world evolves before our eyes. He will tell us how life arrived on earth millions and millions of years ago and will also try to convince us that with terraforming alone the future of living species is in our hands. We are thus given the first game world, a deserted and completely flat land to be shaped to our liking. We adapt quickly to the controls, basically because there are really only two things to do: we can decide to raise the level of the ground or lower it. It seems a bit simplistic said so actually but this is all that, essentially, we will have to do within Birthdays the Beginning. Our actions, of course, have strong consequences and by digging below sea level we will raise the temperature of the planet while by creating mountains and heights we will regulate the temperature downwards. Thus we begin to experiment, with the tutorial which leaves us a fair amount of freedom of action. You dig, pile the sand elsewhere and get by in a game that just doesn't want to be interesting, until, as if by magic, the first small and silly life forms appear underwater. From a Micro management of the game world we thus move on to the Macro screen, full of numbers and statistics of our little universe. In this mode we can easily sit and watch life take shape while the geological eras run fast, but the will of our little alien friend is to make us dare a little more, to pass from single-celled organisms to plants and then get to rule a world made up of fish, dinosaurs and even mammals. The road to success, however, is not so simple and some objectives of the game are not so clear, so much so that you are forced to go groping in the hope that something will happen, despite having already achieved all the objectives of the level. In short, it is an operation of patience, waiting and even a little luck, three elements that are not exactly the best for a structured video game like this. It is therefore curiosity that pushes the player to continue, to make him continue to dig and raise mountains, to collect experience points to increase the playing area and the squares that can be modeled. After about two hours of work in progress, our world was a disastrous Swiss cheese. In fact, the tutorial does not explain that life forms prefer large regular spaces rather than a world made up of continuous ups and downs and holes, forcing us to start over to avoid the tedious remodeling of the entire planet, a not exactly practical task. In fact, there are no tools to quickly level large sectors and the only possibility you have of interacting in this way on the ground is limited to some collectible objects, randomly given to the player while he performs certain actions. Repetitiveness is in the most dangerous predator One of the main problems of this Birthdays the Beginning is that it continues undaunted to ask the player to always do the same thing over and over again, in a cycle that soon tires even those who are eager to learn something and who cannot in any way attract younger players, eager instead to see the dinosaurs move and interact with each other. It really takes too long for the first amphibian organisms to arrive on earth and from there it is complex to develop the ecosystem to give birth and proliferate our beloved reptiles. So basically you play for long periods trying to balance the heat and humidity, hoping that simpler bodies, posti at the base of the food chain, do not disappear preventing predators from surviving. You try to regulate the hot areas with the cold ones and with a little effort you can get to have creatures of different ages to manage at the same time just because our planet manages each single area separately. Thus you will be able to build in one corner a fertile territory for tropical plants and dinosaurs while in the other hemisphere you can make mammals and humans thrive, just because perhaps you are managing water resources differently. Sure, it's all in a video game, but we don't think it represents a credible situation of evolution: a little more care from Toybox on the results of the drilling performed would have been at least welcome. In order not to exasperate too much the player who is unable in any way to reach a turning point, objects of various kinds then think about speeding up the evolutions, or creating mutations in existing beings, an interesting choice at least to allow reaching the ~end game ~ rather easily. The artists behind Birthdays the Beginning have also done a good job with the models of the various existing creatures, giving them a soft and appealing look while keeping the polygon count quite low. However, the trained eye will notice how many of the protagonists of the evolution share the same structural skeleton, unfortunately offering little variety between the various dinosaurs, an unfortunate choice given that it could be one of the useful stimuli for the player to want to continue the adventure. The music is also quite forgettable, especially those in Macro mode, where unfortunately you will spend whole minutes passively. In short, if you were wondering if this dinosaur-based game could stimulate your interest, we are sorry to disappoint you, our advice is to leave it on the shelf unless you are really fasting on sandbox titles and want to experience something different.", "date": "2017-05-27", "grade": "6.0"}
