On that occasion, what we found in our hands certainly did not correspond to what all players expected from Electronic Arts and the Kyoto house. A poorly optimized and old title, with a wrong feeling and deeply distant from its counterparts for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. After about five years and the definitive failure of the Nintendo console, EA tries again on Switch, surprising everyone right there where the premises they didn't seem to bode well. Change the minimum, keep a lot It is clear that what most interests players, undecided on which version of FIFA to buy to spend the usual hours on the world's best-selling football simulator, responds to the need to find in the work of the Bucharest team a port as faithful as possible to the main versions of the title. Having already spent thousands of characters reviewing the standard version of FIFA 18, let's just make it clear that this new iteration abundantly (although not entirely) solves the age-old problem of cut game modes. One above all, the gold mine called FUT, from which all the major sports titles have taken their cue in recent years, is the main reason why this FIFA certainly cannot remain unnoticed. So get ready for epic unpacking, tight negotiations for the purchase of that player who could save your team's chemistry and games against players from all over the world who will spend a few thousand dollars a day. If we want to be extremely picky, we would have to say that there are not a series of small settings that limit the search for players in transfers and that the flaming daily challenges are missing, but we strongly doubt that this will spoil the enthusiasm for the arrival of this mode on a hybrid console like Switch. The true great absence proves to be only the story mode, far from the career and which continues, with the second season, the vicissitudes of Alex Hunter after the luck encountered last year. As repeatedly stated by EA itself, the move was made for a simple technical necessity, given the choice not to use the Frostbite Engine, considered too expensive in terms of hardware requests. Instead, everything else is present and in its best form: therefore ready for free games, seasons (both offline and online) and all those small additions that arrived this year such as the draft and squad creation challenges. But if you've already gone through the vote at the end of the piece, why then can't this FIFA catch up with its older brother? Compromises The answer is very simple and relates to the technical side and to some gameplay and controls trifles that fail to raise it to perfect porting. As previously mentioned, the non-use of the Frostbite Engine only accentuates a technical aspect that is anything but subdued, but certainly far from the fidelity achieved in recent years on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. If we had to bet a nickel, we'd say that this version is probably based on the Legacy Editions for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. The faces of the players are certainly less realistic and everything that forms the background to the action is done in a somewhat superficial way. However, the aspect that really suffers from this is that of the animations, which in a football title make themselves felt not a little: where the home version of FIFA has reached unspeakable heights of quality, instead seeing contrasts that cause exaggerated tumbles or goalkeepers standing still watching the ball pass by them are feelings that we would have gladly avoided. We are talking about a FIFA that tends to go back more towards the arcade rather than approaching the simulation, with a faster action devoted to frenzy and therefore better manageable in the portable mode of the Nintendo console. Don't get us wrong, everything FIFA has promised you will find in its place, but we'd be unfair if we didn't admit that this change in approach clearly cannot please all fans of the EA title. In addition to the purely technical issues, which, however, have an active impact on the gameplay, there is also an artificial intelligence far from that seen on the main consoles. Forget the amount of off-the-ball moves you're used to, or looking for a one-two without asking yourself in advance. We speak clearly of piccothe nuances that do not affect an excellent job of adjusting and optimizing a title that remains a jewel, especially when compared to all the portable iterations of the series, but which it is right to lay bare in the review. Last extremely positive note from a technical point of view: if it is true that the title turns out to be less performing in purely polygonal terms and fidelity to the faces and expressions of the players, this compromise has allowed the Bucharest team to create an almost perfect conversion for what concerns resolution and frame rate. Therefore, if you find yourself playing in portable mode, the title will run at 720p, while in dock mode at 1080p. What is not a little surprising, however, is the fluidity. On both occasions, the title will maintain a granite 60 frames per second, returning a feel and input on the controls that at times seem even better than that of the main versions. The question of the controls also deserves a comment, which remains unchanged as regards the standard configuration (despite a great difficulty for all those who are still used to playing with the directional cross). Things change when you decide to play in two, each with their own Joy-Con: regardless of any perceptible discomfort, the lack of a D-pad and two backbones forces you to give up a series of tactical commands and choices shooting, leading you to create a customized configuration designed specifically for this use, or more simply to take an even more arcadey approach to gameplay. Nothing irreparable, we are still happy to be given the opportunity to play in this mode.
