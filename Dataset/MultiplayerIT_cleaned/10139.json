{"name": "Si riparte da Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/75491-phantasy-star-zero-si-riparte-da-zero.html", "text": "When Phantasy Star Online was released back in 2001 on the Dreamcast, Phantasy Star Online represented, if not exactly a console revolution, at least something very similar: for the first time hundreds of thousands of players around the world became familiar with concepts such as ~online gaming ~, ~in-game chat~ and so on, as well as with the thrill of the community experience that immediately, and thriving, developed around the title and the various sequels and conversions. Mind you, compared to what could be found on PC, the game concept was very simplified and sui generis for obvious technical and market reasons, but things like this had never been tried on consoles. However, online gaming on consoles has come a long way in nine years, while Phantasy Star seems to have remained very close to its origins, as this new portable episode also clearly demonstrates: is age starting to make itself felt? Never change a winning team? In all respects, this Phantasy Star Zero takes up the concepts of every title in the series: in a world devastated by an epic war fought a couple of centuries earlier, mankind is only now beginning to recover, congregating around cities that begin to show the opulence they once were. But, just outside these relatively safe agglomerations, the environment continues to be hostile and dangerous, hence the need for a guild of warriors, the Hunters, who protect citizens and at the same time explore ever deeper territories uninhabited, eliminating potential threats to humanity. The player is put in the shoes of one of these Hunters, to be precise in those of a talented but inexperienced young man who has just finished his training: the first mission consists in fact in going to the local guild leader to be able to enter full title. As anyone who has dedicated at least a little of their time to one of the previous episodes well knows, in the world of Phantasy Star there are three races: the Humans, versatile and good at everything, the Newmans, specialized more in Techniques, and the CAST , sort of androids with a high offensive potential. In addition, there are three large ~branches~ in the art of combat: hand-to-hand combat, combat with long-range weapons and the aforementioned Techniques, which are nothing more than the classic spells of the fantastic videogame imagination; these are the two fundamental choices that the program puts you in front of in the creation of the character, which will then influence your whole style of play. The other possible customizations are all of an aesthetic and accessory nature, and are, nowadays, a bit limited even in the portable field. The character thus created is the one you use in all three game modes: Story Mode, Free Mode and Online, which is the real main mode, which however is best approached after having dedicated a few hours to the developing your own Hunter in solo modes. ~Leveling~ and collecting endless quantities of objects continue to be the real goals of Phantasy Star, and this is both the charm and the limit of the well-tested game formula. All together passionately A powerful teleporter is installed in the guild headquarters which gives access to eight game worlds, some exclusive to offline, which correspond to as many different settings; each map is divided into blocks and the chain from block to block is different every time you enter a world, to ensure a minimum of variety. While in Free Mode you access a setting each time with the sole, declared purpose of accumulating experience and objects, in History you are provided with a whole series of missions of increasing difficulty, which form a plot outline complete with movies in anime style to highlight the highlights. Unfortunately, although theoretically the objectives of the various missions are varied, in fact you always find yourself doing the same thing, that is to say massacring, accompanied by up to three allies commanded by the AI, wave after wave of enemies, until you reach the clash with the boss of the level, generally very difficult; the Story Mode therefore, rather than an intriguing adventure, proves to be an excellent viaticum for the online adventure, in which one of the biggest defects of the title, namely the low intelligence of the allies, is completely missing. However, all the other shortcomings remain, which are not at all linked to the structure itself which, despite all its limitations, will continue to please those who have made Phantasy Star and the community a real passion, but rather to the real action and own. Compared to games in the series available for other consoles, the combat is much less fluid due to a combo system that is too strict in demanding the right timing from the player, the camera that is not very agile and too close, the excessive crowding of the screen, the extremely dancer automatic coupling system: we are not facing a disaster and with a little habit you can manage everything quite well, but that of Phantasy Star Zero is certainly the least successful combat system of the entire saga. It remains to point out the perhaps excessive times needed to find other players in an online game, the by now habitual but always obnoxious method of friend-codes (you can also play with people found at random around the world, but in this case the chat will be heavily limited), some technical notes, such as the gaudy graphic design despite the very visible aliasing and the sound, as unfortunately happens very often lately, without infamy and without praise, and the lack of translation into Italian.", "date": "2010-03-18", "grade": "6.4"}
