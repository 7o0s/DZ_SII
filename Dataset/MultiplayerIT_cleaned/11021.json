{"name": "Saints Row 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saints-row-2_a.html", "text": "When your rival calls itself ~Grand Theft Auto,~ the challenge for dominance can be really, really tough. The developers of THQ know something about it, who with their Saints Row (released two years ago, exclusively for Xbox 360) wanted to take an incredibly tortuous, but nevertheless viable, path: the flaws and shortcomings of the historic (and multimillion-dollar) series Rockstar we know them all a bit, so there is actually room for any competition; and making a better product than that isn't, in the end, an impossible dream. Of course, succeeding at the first attempt or in any case in a short time is another matter, and in fact neither the first Saints Row nor the recent sequel have managed to achieve the goal, for one reason or another. Moving on to mobile gaming, however, the situation is very different and the competition far from numerous, with the recent (and excellent) Car Jack Streets dominating unchallenged. Will the new production of THQ Wireless be able to do better? The early stages of the game are a natural tutorial: our character has just been released from prison and literally has to start a new life, but the only way he knows to do it is anything but legal. In short, we will have to go into hiding, resuming old contacts and answering calls to do our ~job~ within the city of Stilwater: thefts, murders, robberies... things like that. We will be able to move freely in a context with a three-quarter view from above, which together with the size of the sprites represents the real novelty compared to the mobile reduction of the first Saints Row: the graphics are decidedly more detailed, and the smaller distance of the view compared to the action allows us to better manage our travels. As usual, the thing we will have to do more often during the game is to get a vehicle, stopping a car and pressing the 1 key while we are near the counter. In some cases, the passenger will stay with us for some time and we can organize a lightning seizure, obtaining a ransom from family members if we manage to hold him long enough. In any case, once on board a car, the control system will change profoundly, becoming relative to the vehicle: by pressing the d-pad up we will be able to adjust the driving speed to multiple values, while by pressing it left and right we will be able to steer. It is, in the end, the exact same system used in Car Jack Streets. From the pause screen it is possible to modify the controls and make them relative to the screen, but the situation gets worse rather than better: it is the case to get some experience with the default setting, enduring the inevitable crashes. The variety of missions is good, and the combat system allows us to defend ourselves both from near and far by simply pressing the 5 key. At any time, we will be able to check the radar located in the lower left part of the screen, which will indicate the places we need to go to to achieve our goals. As far as the technical realization is concerned, the game looks much better than the first episode: the type of visual in itself makes everything more pleasant, with a good level of detail and a fairly fluid scrolling. The realization of the characters is only discreet, especially for the animations, but the vastness of the practicable spaces makes you turn a blind eye to everything else. It's a shame that more could not be done with regards to vehicle and property damage (lampposts simply disappear on impact), while running over people leaves corpses and blood trails galore. Speaking of contrails, the tire marks on the asphalt are really nice to look at, as is the rain. The sound, unfortunately, consists of MIDI music of modest quality and there are no effects. PRO Rich and detailed graphics A large number of missions Simple control system... AGAINST ...except when driving Collisions too frequent and problematic Often frustrating", "date": "2008-11-25", "grade": "S.V."}
