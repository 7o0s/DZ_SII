We are still talking about a super-secret police force, above the government, which has been managing the transit of aliens on planet Earth for decades and promptly resolves any problems ... even when they could lead to the destruction of the entire universe! In the third episode of the series, out in Italian cinemas these days, Agent J even has to go back in time to avert a terrible threat. Did Gameloft include this theme in Men in Black 3? We say yes and no: while making a vague reference to the plot of the film, the tie-in presents us with completely different characters and a story created for the occasion, which unfolds very slowly while our agent is busy managing the MIB base or to carry out routine operations within the various scenarios that gradually become available. It goes without saying that the action-packed and adrenaline-pumping sequences to which Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have accustomed us are but a vague memory, compared to the setting chosen for this production: the classic Farmville-style casual management, available on the App Store and Google Play in freemium format and therefore downloadable for free, but with the possibility of making in-game purchases to make the experience ~quicker~ and more complete. The French house seems to be trying to specialize with this particular videogame vein, evidently very fashionable; just think that just a few weeks ago it released a very similar title, Ice Age: The Village. Ultimately, the gameplay is the same: we are continually assigned new missions and, in most cases, to complete them we simply have to follow the instructions on the screen, ~spend~ our precious energy points (which are recharged with spending time, or putting his wallet in hand), start the construction of certain structures and wait for them to be ready. However little you are... The developers have done a good job in terms of progression, this must be admitted: as our character levels up, thanks to the experience points acquired, he can access new objects, new weapons, new structures and new scenarios. However, the experience is enriched only in appearance, given that the things to do remain the same and what changes is only the way in which they are presented to us. So we will continually try our hand at creating locations, recruiting new agents, sending them on missions, beautifying and upgrading the MIB base and so on. The only positive note: in certain moments we will actually be able to take control of the situation and play, in this case when we will have to face a firefight with particularly hostile aliens. In this case the mechanics proposed by Gameloft are similar to those of a turn-based strategy, and the final result is not brilliant but at least it gives us the opportunity to do something different. It must also be recognized that the touch control system finally correctly detects the outlines of objects and characters, allowing us to select them without having to systematically resort to magnification, as instead happened in the aforementioned Ice Age: The Village, as well as in other productions of the same kind. Finally, the graphics are good: the settings are fairly detailed, as are the sprites, also equipped with decent animation.", "date": "2012-06-12", "grade": "6.5"}
