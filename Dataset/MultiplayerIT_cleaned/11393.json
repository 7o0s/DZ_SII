Upon passing this test, the young man should receive an honor from the Queen ... but the Queen is not there, apparently she is ill and does not want to receive visitors. This arouses much concern in Prince Gaston, who decides to follow his mother when she mysteriously leaves the kingdom, asking Blade to accompany him. What is the Queen hiding? Why is he wearing a mask and acting weird? What is the connection between the various characters and the demon who was defeated by the heroes of Avalonia five years earlier? We will discover this and more during our expeditions, which will often be joined by companions each with unique characteristics. Accustomed to a first-person view only during fights, Dragon Quest fans will find themselves moving and acting exclusively in this way this time, using only the Wii-mote to perform all operations. When we find ourselves within the city walls, we can use the d-pad to turn around and the B trigger to walk, where their simultaneous pressure allows us to run. The pointing device of the controller projects a cursor onto the screen that allows us to interact with the other characters (it is possible to talk to anyone you meet) and to look for useful objects inside barrels or under stones. The control system changes when we set off on a quest: exploration is reduced to a minimum, in the sense that we can only proceed forward and the only variations on the theme occur when forks appear, with a message asking us which way do we want to go. When an enemy appears in front of us, we will no longer be able to move but will have to rely solely on sword and shield, both to be maneuvered using the Wii-mote. Arms and baggage Within the walls of Avalonia, we will find several shops where we can buy weapons, armor and objects of various types. The former have a somewhat particular upgrade system: we will not be able to replace our sword with another, but we will have to have it tempered and in different ways depending on the money available and, above all, on the materials we have collected during the last mission. As far as shields and armor are concerned, the discussion is instead of the classic type, with the various models that are normally purchased and replace the ones we wear (and which we can then eventually sell). In addition to the shops, we will also find a stall that gives us access to a series of simple mini-games, as well as a cave in which a talking cat will offer us to exchange the medals in our possession for a series of objects of different nature... Combat system The random fights, cross and delight of all RPGs, are also present in this new episode of Dragon Quest; but with a substantial difference, represented by the fact that we will not be passive spectators of the clashes, but first-person protagonists: when an enemy appears in front of us, we will no longer be able to move but will have to rely solely on sword and shield, both of which must be maneuvered using the Wii -mote. The first reproduces in a fairly faithful way the cuts and jabs that we carry out in front of the screen, presenting a sort of ~viewfinder~ that is activated with the A button and allows us to concentrate the attacks in a precise point, to overcome the limitations of the controllers. It is also possible to use this technique to send arrows and bullets back to the sender, hitting at the right moment after having identified the point where the enemy will attack, a point which is indicated by a signal a few moments before the impact. Precisely because the attacks on our group are signaled visually, we will be able to use the shield to parry them: by holding down the trigger B, the cursor will take on the features of our shield, in transparency, and we will be able to repel the blows of the enemies with a different degree of precision, taking advantage of any loss of balance to go on the counterattack. The shield is far from indestructible: if the blows touch it in the central part there are no problems, but if they break on the edges we will see the instrument ~disassemble~ little by little. To remedy this situation we will have to use a magical herb, to be purchased and kept in the inventory together with potions, antidotes and anything else we can find in our trusted shops, between one shipment and another. Technical realization Dragon Quest fans will be happy to know that the three historical figures of the series worked on this episode: Yuji Horii, Akira Toriyama and Koichi Sugiyama. I turns outyou, on a technical level, can be seen: the characters are all well drawn, each with a precise identity and discrete animations. The quality of the polygonal models is good (although clearly ~old gen~) and the details can be appreciated especially during the interlude sequences. As far as the scenarios are concerned, on the one hand we have some good transparency effects, a skilful use of colors and backdrops with an average richness in elements; on the other, a graphics engine that shows its limits all too often, given that during the quests it is not possible to look around and that when you move to the various areas of the city you have to wait for loading times. Nothing to say about the enemies: they are so many, all different, very often deliberately ridiculous (Toriyama's hand can also and above all be seen at this juncture). The sound sector makes use of rather classic effects, reproduced in part by the small speaker of the Wii-mote, and well-made music, decidedly functional to the action. Unfortunately none of the songs reaches such qualitative peaks as to remain in the lead after the game. The Italian edition is translated very well in the screen texts (with the now usual license to introduce the Roman dialect for some side characters...), while the speech is in English. Comment The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors is a decidedly atypical episode for the Dragon Quest series, evidently oriented towards a user that is anything but ~hardcore~. It is a product that adapts very well to those who have never tried an RPG, given the simple and linear structure. Precisely this peculiarity, however, makes it less attractive to those who expected not only a control system that was revolutionary in many ways, but also an evolution of the structure that combined simplicity and depth. Given the average quality of video games produced by ~third parties~ for Wii, the Square Enix title is anything but contemptible, on the contrary, it still stands as a reference for its genre, despite the many ingenuities and despite a duration well beyond below Dragon Quest average. While waiting for a new, more substantial and articulated episode, fans of the series will still have something to settle for. Pros First person combat Good level graphics Simple structure... Cons ...maybe too much The Wii-mote isn't always accurate, indeed Rather limited longevity", "date": "2008-05-29", "grade": null}
