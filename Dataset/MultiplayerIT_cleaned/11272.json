{"name": "Metal Slug 7 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-7-recensione.html", "text": "Metal Slug changed the face of so-called ~action games~, providing the Neo Geo platform with a great value alternative to the numerous fighting games. Released in theaters for the first time in 1996, the game put us in the role of a soldier of Italian origin, Marco Rossi, who alone (or in tandem with his partner Tarma, in the multiplayer mode for two players) had to defeat an entire army of terrorists. To succeed in the enterprise, Marco could only count on his own skill and on the numerous weapons to collect along the way: machine guns of various types, rocket launchers, grenades but also armored vehicles. The developers unleashed their imagination to equip the character with devastating equipment, but also to pit him against enemies as impressive as they are dangerous. It was also an opportunity for technical growth, in fact Metal Slug was the first SNK title to boast a particular style in 2D animation, later introduced in franchises such as King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, etc. The success of the series has led to the release of a large number of sequels, as well as the arrival on all home consoles, which recently saw the release of the compilation Metal Slug Anthology for Wii, PS2 and PSP. This seventh chapter exclusively for Nintendo DS doesn't limit itself to always proposing the same basic mechanics, but introduces a couple of elements that can actually make a difference. Something new? The latest episodes of Metal Slug have seen the addition of some characters to the initial couple, which has now transformed into a group of six well-characterized warriors, who however still lack a diversification of skills: choose the classic Marco Rossi or Ralf of the Ikari Warrior makes no difference in our approach to the action, and that's something we hope will change in the future. The situation relating to weapons and equipment is different, which have increased in both cases and bring with them some pleasant surprises. In any case, this seventh chapter exclusively for Nintendo DS doesn't limit itself to always proposing the same basic mechanics, only changing the scenario of the clashes, but introduces a couple of elements that can actually make the difference between a product that leads to finished in a few hours and one that manages to entertain us even for a few weeks. First of all, the difficulty level is very well balanced: Metal Slug fans will find themselves struggling, as it should be, already at the ~normal~ level, while novices will probably have to start from the ~easy~ level. The most important thing, in this sense, is the lack of infinite ~continues~: we will have a total of five credits, after which we will incur the inevitable game over. To avoid clear episodes of frustration, however, the game allows us to start from the last stage reached rather than repeating everything from scratch every time. In action! Secondly, the ~School of combat~ has been added to the classic main game mode, which is a large series of short challenges in which we will have to demonstrate our worth by achieving certain objectives: eliminate all enemies in a stage, or free all hostages, or fighting using only one weapon, etc. This is an important addition, which significantly increases longevity and which represents, to date, a completely new element for the series: we hope it is only the first of many. For the rest, the feeling of the game is always the same, and the controls on Nintendo DS are classic but work very well: the d-pad to move the character, B to jump, Y to shoot, A to throw the grenade and the R shoulder to change the equipped weapon. Interestingly, the configuration can be fully customized by going into the options, where you can also activate the automatic fire. Certainly the peculiar characteristics of the dual-screen portable console have not been fully exploited (the touch screen is only used to view the map), but nothing else could be expected if you did not want to distort a mechanic that has been working great for years. Technical realization Being an episode exclusively for Nintendo DS, one could not expect less than a perfect edition in terms of sprites and scenarios. From this point of view, you are not disappointed at all: all the characters have the usual, excellent animations, the weapons are numerous, you can use armored vehicles of different types and the bosses are huge and fearsome. The scenarios, unfortunately, are ~washed out~ like those of Metal Slug 6, they are definitely lacking in definition. It is a pity that we have not returned to the glories of the first chapters, but the result is still very respectable. Of course, it must be emphasized that each missioit is divided into several ~single~ phases, a choice probably dictated by the technical limits of the console, but it is something that does not bother too much. A very similar argument can be made for music and effects: the former are very beautiful and feel really good, the latter do their job well but are definitely starting to feel the weight of the years. The control system, as mentioned above, uses the d-pad and buttons instead of stylus and touch screen, as was to be expected, and it works very well indeed: the character responds promptly to input, without ever a problem. The game boasts a translation of the texts on the screen into Italian, which is especially useful in the ~School of combat~ mode, since we will have to talk to a charming superior before embarking on the various missions... Comment Metal Slug fans will not be disappointed by this seventh episode, exclusively for Nintendo DS: the mechanics of the game are always the same (after all, ~the winning team doesn't change~), there are seven substantial stages to complete and finally a balancing of the sensible difficulty, which prevents us from completing the game on the first try by taking advantage of infinite ~continues~. To this we must also add the excellent ~School of combat~ mode, that is a series of short but very interesting challenges, which on the one hand give the possibility to ~metabolize~ the various stages well, on the other they definitely lengthen the expectation of product life. And can we talk about the technical realization? You probably couldn't do better on Nintendo DS: numerous sprites, excellent animations, huge bosses and no slowdowns. If you've always loved Metal Slug, you can't miss this new episode. And if you don't know the series... well, it's time to fix it. Pros Very good graphics Very interesting extra mode Finally a good balance of difficulty Cons Not very long-lived The basic mechanics are always the same Poorly defined backdrops, like in Metal Slug 6", "date": "2008-08-04", "grade": null}
