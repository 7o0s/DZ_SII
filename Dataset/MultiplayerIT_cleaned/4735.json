At least, this is the setting of the present Road Warriors, which in order not to miss anything in terms of eccentricity also puts the user in the role of a bizarre anthropomorphic chicken: fortunately the title Lucky Kat is not only a mere succession of absurdities, but also a free to play with very clear ideas put into practice with due skill. Always in a rush Using a system that is not new in the mobile sector, Road Warriors offers a different challenge for each day of the week, inviting the user to access the application every day so as not to miss a single race: in reality, it is also possible to go back in the calendar and face past competitions, but to do this you must necessarily undergo the vision of an advertisement. A modus operandi that recalls the one adopted by Nitrome with its Leap Day, also as regards the almost active role played by the commercials in the playful economy, which in fact become a substitute for the game's currency: unlock a checkpoint, buy a cash of supplies or even securing an extra attempt following a fatal accident are all transactions that can be satisfied by spending the coins collected during the races or by agreeing to watch promotional videos of other games or smartphone applications. Therefore, although there are always the classic in-app purchases to immediately obtain large quantities of virtual credits, Road Warriors does not belong to the much feared category of pay-to-win products, and you can therefore play all in all quietly even without necessarily putting your hand to the card of credit. Having cleared the field of this element that always marks a very deep dividing line between the public, let's talk more strictly about gameplay, simple and immediate as required by the best mobile tradition: the races develop on a two-dimensional plane, acceleration is automatic and the player is asked to press anywhere on the screen to make the car jump and thus avoid obstacles as well as to tap on the opponents he meets along the way to activate a short slow motion mode (a bit confusing to be honest) useful to shoot with the machine gun provided. Destroying rival cars guarantees a temporary boost, and the same effect can be obtained by performing rotations in flight by maintaining pressure on the touch screen while suspended in the air: here the most classic of risk/benefit mechanisms comes into play, since increasing the speed is needed to cross the finish line in front but one wrong move can reduce the car to a pile of ash. The checkpoint system also falls within this perspective, given that the user is left with the choice of spending coins to ensure a more comfortable restart in the event of death or of keeping the loot and moving forward, however, risking having to start over after an accident . More money equals more chances to improve your car in the appropriate garage section that can be reached between one race and another, even if here Lucky Kat perhaps could have done better: in fact, you can only buy boxes that hold random upgrades, and the unnecessary modifications cannot be resold or recycled in any way, making the system a little too much like a lottery.", "date": "2017-08-09", "grade": "7.8"}
