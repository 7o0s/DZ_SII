{"name": "FIFA Manager 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-manager-08-recensione.html", "text": "As a form I will use the 5-5-5 Once everything has been defined, the time will come for the beloved/hated press conference, where from time to time we will have to answer the journalists, who on more than one occasion will try to put us in difficulty with sharp questions, the answers to which will have a positive effect or negative about the team, with the fans and with the press itself. The excellent interface and the well-calibrated difficulty curve allow you to immediately become familiar with the many management areas available, grouped into four groups: team, transfers, club and career. A practical email system allows you to keep everything under control, taking the player immediately to where his attention is required with a simple click. Naturally it will be allowed to act even when it is not expressly requested in order to set up a long-term strategy. Organizing a pre-season friendly, managing training sessions, buying new players and improving their harmony is incredibly intuitive, but to get the best results right away, careful reading of the manual is still essential. Play only those who are fit If certain management options appear too complex to follow, it will be possible to press the ~recommended choice~ button, as in the case of the assistant manager, who will select, for example, those who according to him are the most fit players for the next match. When the time comes to take the field, it will be possible to choose from countless options regarding the men involved, the scheme to adopt and the visualization of the match, which can take place in 3D, in the form of text or directly with the final result. For visualization with text, on certain goal occasions it will be possible to choose whether to pass the ball, shoot or dribble. Same thing when it comes to beating penalties, where we will be called to choose direction, height and shot power. During the season, it will be pleasant to see how the newspapers talk or not about the team or how the club and national events are going, greatly favoring immersion in the football world. On the licensing front, FIFA Manager 08 offers as many as 20 leagues, even if the names of some teams and players are missing, which in some cases do not have real logos and names respectively. Some inaccuracies can also be found for the photos of the players, such as for Christian Vieri, who wears the Monaco shirt, for which he played two seasons ago. What computer do you need? FIFA Manager 08 offers the possibility to build new stadiums by means of a powerful editor. Although the technical aspect is notoriously not the most important aspect in management with a football background, the 3D visualization of the matches is not a bad thing. The system requirements are then within everyone's reach. The screens and drop-down menus appear complete, well done and, as already mentioned, rather intuitive even for those approaching the genre for the first time. On the audio front, the soundtrack is really pleasant and never invasive, perfect for making gaming sessions longer. On the other hand, Bruno Longhi's audio commentary during the matches should be forgotten, completely out of phase with the action.

The many possibilities offered for the management of the team and the company, easily adapt to the player's preferences, also allowing, thanks to the excellent interface, to learn every aspect of the title with the utmost ease. For the future it is legitimate to expect a more complete and precise database than the current one. Pros Customizable management model Intuitive interface Excellent soundtrack Cons Some inaccuracies in the licenses Audio commentary to be reviewed FIFA Manager 08 is available for PC. In a country like Italy, where by now anyone can say everything and the opposite of everything about football, just for the pleasure of generating more or less civil discussions, the genre of football management has always offered the possibility of verifying one's competence. The FIFA Manager series, now in its third episode, takes into consideration every aspect of managing a team, demonstrating how complex roles are often subject to easy criticism. Once the game has started, you will be able to choose yesand simply be (so to speak) coaches or also devote yourself to the acquisition campaign, merchandising and the company budget. It will then be necessary to define the characteristics of our character and in this regard, in addition to being able to select a female manager, there is the possibility of creating a homosexual couple with lots of children. When deciding which championship to play, it will be possible to start from the lower divisions or take control of a big team. In Italy, only a few mid-range teams will be available at the start, such as Parma, Reggina, Naples and Turin. The only big team available right away is Juventus, which as newly promoted has been included among the companies that can be selected immediately.", "date": "2007-12-04", "grade": null}
