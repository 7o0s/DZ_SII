{"name": "The Ballad of Gay Tony", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71772-grand-theft-auto-iv-the-ballad-of-gay-tony-tra-discoteca-sesso-e-liberty-city.html", "text": "Tony Prince is Liberty City's King of the Night, running two of the city's most famous clubs, one for straight and one for gays, like the owner himself. Luis Lopez, the player's character, is his business partner, though his only business is playing bouncer at Tony's clubs and getting him out of trouble, as business plummets and the player's lifestyle boss, naiv and over the top (in all possible senses), seems to no longer guarantee him the success of a time. These are the protagonists of The Ballad of Gay Tony, the second expansion of Grand Theft Auto IV, exclusively for Xbox 360, and spectacular closure of a trilogy in the service of some of the best characters ever created in a video game, who meet again here to close some of the events that remained pending previously and to still give hours and hours of passion to the thousands of fans of the saga. At the end of The Lost and Damned, we wondered what Rockstar would come up with to amaze again and the answer is absolutely nothing. Because this time Rockstar has undoubtedly played on mature and strong tones, but on the funniest action, the fluidity of the succession of events, and on a world that seems to have infinite stories to tell. Without tears and with a return to the most glamorous face of Grand Theft Auto. What's new in town? GTA is part of that genre, not to mention basically defined it in the eyes of the general public, called ~sandbox~, just to get the idea of the shapelessness of the sand, reminiscent of a type of game with a loose structure , in which to move following the plot or simply having fun with the laws that govern the world. The strength of this concept lies entirely in the identification that is felt by playing the most successful titles and of which GTA has always been one of the bulwarks, while one of the weak points has always been that of relegating the experience, mostly, to explorations of outdoor environments with the sensation of being in unrealistic worlds. What you realize while playing The Ballad of Gay Tony is that Rockstar has managed to create a city so alive and believable that it almost completely eliminates this feeling, giving the player enough space to move around and so many things to do and not have more time than that to experience a fascinating virtual reality like few others. With this latest expansion we also realize that with GTA IV the Sandbox concept has been extended, but towards the inside, in the sense that the supporting structure is adaptable to any story and to any character the team decides to tell, also because each time functional innovations are introduced to the life of the protagonist, who in this case is a bouncer and a playboy. The Ballad of Gay Tony oozes with the glamor of nightclubs, life in extremes, casual sex and describes, without making a joke of it, the existence of a bouncer, complete with a simulator mini-game, thanks to which you enter one of the clubs managed by Tony and you walk around keeping an eye on the various corners, ready to intervene in cases of customers who do not want to pay or annoying drunks to be accompanied to the door. Abandoned the motorcycles of The Lost & Damned, shot drinking, (hilarious) dance competitions and fight club appear, because Luis is an ex-convict who has become a phenomenal hitter behind bars, and who will have the opportunity to get in the service of the protagonists or to interact with all the plots left open in this trilogy, but which anyone can enjoy regardless. In between drugs, excesses and the irony that is now a hallmark for the series and that allows Rockstar to tackle the most thorny issues without there being any doubts about the intent for which they are put on track: to amuse those who play, making them passionate .GTA, however, is also action and here are some of the most successful sequences of GTA IV, also thanks to the insertion of the protagonist's parachute in some of the game's key missions, giving life to truly spectacular sections, as well as constituting a real and own minigame and a means of getting around the city. In an adrenaline escalation that leads to an ending that has nothing to envy to the best television serials, which are strengthened by their protagonists told with small brushstrokes in many different moments. The video review Xbox 360 goals The Ballad of Gay Tony adds another 250 points to the total of GTA IV, which therefore rises to 1500 with The Lost & Damned (500 points, however, for those who will only play Episodes from Liberty City). Only a small part of the 250 are obtained by finishing the game, while the bulk will take a long time, especially in the case of objectives related to completing allthe missions with an 80% rating, not to mention the one that provides the perfect score in each of them. What comes back The work done by Rockstar on RAGE, the polygonal engine that moves Luis and Tony, has now reached maturity and thanks to realistic physics and light effects, Liberty City returns to be admired by the player especially in the parachute flight sequences, a sign tangible form of a truly flexible and subtly ~powerful~ technological structure. Freedom is accentuated even more by the greater use that must be made of helicopters during the game, even if the absence of a lock on for the flight phases does not make life very easy, while trying to avoid the skyscrapers all around . Considering The Ballad of Gay Tony an expansion is truly limiting, given that we managed to complete the game with more than 10 hours active and without having practically paid attention to all the mini-games present, including the missions of the ~Drugs War~, involving Luis in a gang war around Liberty City. Rockstar has then inserted a further novelty, also linked to the achievement of objectives, or a screen that summarizes some key elements of each mission and which attributes a percentage of completion for each of them, valid only if the mission itself has been completed without dying. Once the game is over, therefore, you can spend hours perfecting yourself, in an attempt to improve your score and unlock the related objectives, also because some stages are simply fun, and it certainly doesn't hurt to be able to do them again on board a nice armored vehicle which, like the parachute, becomes part of Luis's equipment. Episodes from Liberty City Simultaneously with the download via Xbox Live, Rockstar publishes Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City, which is a package containing both expansions, both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. The peculiarity is that, in this form, they can be played even without owning Grand Theft Auto IV, giving anyone the opportunity to enjoy a concentrate of emotions in pure GTA style. Perhaps, even more recommended than buying the base game, for those who can be scared of the 30 hours it would take to finish last year's game.", "date": "2009-10-30", "grade": "9.2"}
