{"name": "Bury Me", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bury-me-my-love-recensione-pc.html", "text": "It may seem gloomy, but ~Bury me, my love~ (something like ~If you love me, don't die~) - which in the original language obviously sounds different even in literal terms, but this is the concept that comes closest to it - is in truth a wish and a recommendation, a phrase that demonstrates the extreme love one feels for the other, to whom we address the desire to survive. The main concept of Pixel Hunt and Arte France's game is ultimately this: a love relationship that seeks to pass through the most extreme conditions and to gain strength in the midst of the brutalities of a world at war. What makes this work particularly important, one might say necessary, is its setting, i.e. the war in Syria and its consequences throughout the Middle East, which transforms a simple journey of a few hundred kilometers into a desperate mission search for new life possibilities, in constant balance with death. The story is based on real stories and testimonies from Syrian refugees and stages a couple's attempt to escape from Syria, forced to split up to make the crossing to Europe in two different moments. Nour, the girl, is a doctor, capable and resolute but also multifaceted and realistic in the ingenuity and uncertainties that necessarily emerge when life suddenly finds itself in danger. She finds herself having to set off alone while Majd can do nothing but follow the stages from home, hoping that everything goes well and supporting the journey with suggestions and encouragements, waiting to be able to leave himself and be able to reunite with her at the destination . The player is called upon to play his role, making various choices that can influence the story but forced to watch from a distance, but always in contact, as this enveloping story of love and hope unfolds, released in 2017 in mobile format and already reviewed at the time. Love in times of war (and whatsapp) In addition to the scenography that forms the background to the story, it is the way in which this is narrated that strikes with remarkable effectiveness. The whole game takes place by simulating a smartphone chat between the two protagonists, complete with multimedia content, videos and photos exchanged, emojis and animations typical of applications of this type. To all intents and purposes, Bury Me, My Love is an interactive story that remains rather far from the standard features of the video game, rather approaching those typical of the visual novel. In this way it manages to determine a deep identification with the events of the story, placing us directly within it as one of the two interlocutors. The answers we can give are obviously pre-established, but in many cases we find ourselves being able to choose between different phrases and options that can lead to different developments in the story, reaching up to 19 different endings, apparently. The duration, the sequence of events and their conclusion can therefore change substantially through the numerous choices granted and given the elements of the plot can also lead to decidedly dramatic and high-impact outcomes, prompting you to return to the game and experiment with different paths, perhaps pointing to more positive conclusions. Moreover, the rhythm and style with which the story is told is remarkable, because the dialogues between the two protagonists are never banal and outline two extremely vivid and realistic figures, multifaceted and in various respects unpredictable as those who find themselves in such a situation. Their depth makes us immerse ourselves fully in the situation, humanizes the tragedy of war and brings it extremely close to us, making the various choices we find ourselves making to help Nour find the best escape route suddenly important and disturbing. The genius of the mobile version of the game lies precisely in the realism of the conversation and we find instead the greatest weakness of the PC and Nintendo Switch version: the illusion of being part of a real chat is almost completely lost in this new context. The smartphone app takes possession of the entire device and completely transforms it into the tool used by Majd, so much so as to insert imposed pauses in communication in correspondence with moments of forced silence in the story and messages that can arrive in the background at any time of the day or of the night, to simulate a real conversation with a real traveller. It is a simple trick but able to make the use of this game on smartphones perfect, which obviously does not work on PC or console, also given the practically direct transposition of the game from one format to another. A'important experience It doesn't happen often but Bury Me, My Love turns out to be a game that is preferable to play on smartphones precisely because the medium - rarely as in this case with regard to video games - strongly contributes to making sense of the message, paraphrasing a bit the good old McLuhan. This does not detract from the quality of the story, which is still remarkable. To go on a more prosaic level, even the technical adaptation is carried out somewhat at the minimum wage, complete with direct transposition of the screen in vertical format specifically designed for use on smartphones and reproposed on PC and console screens with large side edges. The space is filled by reproductions of photos that the two interlocutors gradually exchange, but the effect is perhaps not the best, at least when compared with the impact that a representation of this kind has on a smartphone screen. They are extremely secondary elements compared to the basic core of the experience offered by Bury Me, My Love, mind you, but if there is a choice between the different platforms it is good to take these aspects into consideration too. The cancellation of the ~real time~ pauses in the conversation is an element that flattens the experience of the game, because there is not that waiting for Nour's answers which makes us discover with some astonishment that we are really distressed by the fate of this virtual character, struggling with damn real risks and problems such as the need to turn off the phone near a border to save battery, or crossing areas with no signal. In this sense, more than in the inconsistencies of the interface, this conversion somewhat weakens the impressive impact that the original version has.", "date": "2019-01-09", "grade": "7.8"}
