It happens that highly spectacular images and sequences alternate on the screen, in a mix of style and design that strikes from the first moment and that manages to renew itself from level to level, offering us some of the craziest and most interesting solutions ever seen. The first Icycle was born as a web game (you can play it by clicking here, for free) based on these ideas, characterized by a simple but effective concept: a completely naked man, riding a tiny bicycle, who has to explore a series of scenarios avoiding chasms and traps. It all seems very easy, doesn't it? And sometimes it actually is, in the sense that the gameplay often bends to the artistic direction: things have to go a certain way, show us certain scenes and therefore put aside the concept of success and failure ... at least until the test next one. The control system, with two arrows on the left side of the screen and a button for jumping (and for opening an umbrella that allows us to slow down the falls, by holding it down), lends itself very well to a dry and essential interpretation of the experience , and with Icycle: On Thin Ice, which marks the franchise's debut on iOS devices, these elements of immediacy have been accompanied by an enhancement of the technical sector in terms of detail, fluidity and... visionary genius. Icycle: On Thin Ice is a feast for the eyes, a design exercise not to be missed bike thieves Watching Dennis ride naked on his tiny bike is a lot of fun in itself, but it's just one of the highlights of Icycle: On Thin Ice. Net of an upgrade system that honestly leaves the time it finds, including in-app purchases, the game in fact offers us levels that are very different from each other, in which the constant of ice and snowy expanses marries rather varied: the jump from one peak to another, the precision maneuvers to avoid the spikes protruding from the ground, the forward and backward marches to accommodate the dynamic changes of the scenario, even the ~dream~ sequences in which the protagonist has to face inverse gravity situations that seem to be set inside a painting. And then again the explosive mines that clear the way to the next areas of the stage, the close-up shots or from far away, which sometimes force you to play by sharpening your eyes to identify the character. The end result is not something essential from a playful point of view, indeed, if you think about it, it is also a bit trivial. In the same way, however, it is an exercise in style in which many visual solutions are experimented, capable of surprising each new screen, making us wonder how the author managed to imagine that particular scene, that particular composition. In short, the artistic value of the game, available for only 89 cents on the App Store, is indisputable and makes it a truly recommended purchase, very nice to look at and also accompanied by a sound that lives up to expectations.", "date": "2013-12-16", "grade": "8.0"}
