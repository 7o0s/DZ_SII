Since that distant 2015, we've seen this great little game make a comeback time and time again, releasing on virtually every platform out there. Last year a remastered version of the title, including the spin-off Before The Storm, landed on the current generation of consoles, as well as on Google's streaming service, Stadia. It took a while, but the adventures of Max and Chloe also made their official debut on Nintendo Switch, with a new exclusive edition for the portable console par excellence. In the review of Life is Strange: Arcadia Bay Collection we will see the merits and the defects of this operation. Eight years and not hear them Life is Strange: Arcadia Bay Collection: we return as Max in the new Nintendo Switch version From time to time some generational works are revealed capable of lasting over time and continuing to amaze even after years of distance (albeit with some technical compromises). Life is Strange is one of those cases. If you have never had the opportunity to approach this series, we briefly introduce you to the events narrated. Max, a young student of figurative arts at the renowned Blackwall Academy, suddenly discovers that she has supernatural powers, with which she is able to rewind time at will. Reunited by pure chance with her childhood best friend Chloe, the girl will have to learn to control her innate talent so as to try to avert a great danger that looms titanic over the small town of Arcadia Bay. As is usual for products that put teenagers in charge of the narrative, what we are dealing with is a coming-of-age story somewhere between the fantastic and the detective, since the inhabitants of this fictitious Oregon seaside town hide many secrets . The spin-off Before The Storm, on the other hand, puts us in Chloe's shoes, making us go back three years before the events of the base game and providing us with some background on some facts that we will not reveal to you. A key feature of the game is its decision-making nature, with multiple choices that will shape the future of events and decide the outcome of your game, complete with statistics at the end of each episode (five in the base game, three in the spin-off). which show the percentage of choices made by the other players. On a narrative level, obviously, this collection for Switch doesn't add anything new, but it was good to outline a general picture for those (few) who have not yet had the opportunity to try this experience firsthand. A portable adventure Life is Strange: Arcadia Bay Collection: Is it worth playing in handheld mode? Surely, the most interesting element of this umpteenth re-edition of Life is Strange is its new dimension, which leaves the television ~big screens~ to reach the shores of portability. We had already had the opportunity to deal with this type of approach, thanks to the release on Stadia, but the ways of using it are very different. Here we are faced with a game that runs in real time on a console that is physically in the user's hands. An ~old-fashioned~ experience, if you pass the term, without the mediation of a streaming service. This translates into an image that is certainly cleaner and with fewer graphic artifacts, but which has to deal with dated hardware, the which often shows the side, especially when played on a TV. However, it is clear that the main focus for this port was portable mode. And it must be said that, from this point of view, the game perhaps fails to amaze, but at least to surprise. Perfection is far from being achieved (very long loading even between small scenario passages; a bit of input lag, especially from the TV), but the result is more than acceptable, in a union between fluidity and visual detail (for how graphically the game is not excessively complex) which is satisfying to have in your hands while you are taking a long train journey or waiting your turn at the doctor.", "date": "2022-10-02", "grade": "7.0"}
