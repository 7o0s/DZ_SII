An 8GB iPod Touch might not be so happy with the new guest, but the weight is justified by the amount of meat on the fire that the transalpine house has packed in this new portable adventure by Sam Fisher. The port for iPhone and iPod Touch in fact seeks to offer an experience, if not identical, as similar as that of the counterpart for PC and Xbox 360, and does so by replicating the same storyline and the same approach to the game, which jumps continuously between stealth sessions and third-person firefights. Introduced by a short CG film, the story begins with Sam Fisher on a mission to Malta, looking for information about his daughter Sarah and the mystery surrounding her presumed death. Many of the events, precisely because they resume exactly what was left open in the previous chapters, could be difficult to understand for those approaching the series for the first time. The fact that several dialogues and situations have been skimmed compared to the original game only makes things worse: an example is the character of Victor Coste, introduced from the beginning and playable in a flashback, but described so badly that the player will have the impression of having missed some step. Certainly, a brief summary at the beginning of the game would have done nothing but benefit the novice iPhone user. A 007 under the lens In addition to the plot, Splinter Cell Conviction for iPhone also inherits some stylistic and visual ideas from the home version, such as the targets projected onto the walls of the buildings or the silhouettes that Sam Fisher leaves momentarily in the places where he is sighted. However, while on PC and consoles the colors disappear when you're out of sight, this is not the case on the iPhone version, where everything is limited to a red icon in the corner of the screen. If on the one hand it is certainly a much less elegant solution, on the other it is very likely that on a mobile device it would not have rendered in the same way and, indeed, would have risked making the entire game unwatchable. After the very first hours, you finally begin to understand why Splinter Cell Conviction takes up so much space in the memory of your iPhone: in addition to being technically remarkable and with excellent three-dimensional graphics, the game offers a large number of levels with all different scenarios between them. Unfortunately it happens to find yourself facing slews of clone enemies, but the variety in environments and situations is truly commendable, with the player being constantly catapulted from one place to another in the world. Too bad that everything is dirtied by sometimes inexplicable level design choices: in a mission set in Iraq, for example, it is enough to collect a bazooka to see some tanks and soldiers magically appear from a previously cleared path. The AI of the enemies is also bad, which most of the time do nothing but run against Fisher without seeking cover, ready to be greeted with a bullet in the forehead. Not that it's that easy, mind you: often taking aim requires a bit of time spent playing with the control system, whereas sneaking up behind an enemy and knocking them out can be a bit of a challenge. gives much more satisfaction. From time to time you will have to interrogate some characters, threatening and hitting them until they spit it out: it would be an interesting idea, if it didn't resolve everything in a repeated pressing of a single button. Furthermore, it is always better to make sure that you have taken out all the enemies in the vicinity before interrogating someone, since once the interrogation has begun, you cannot let go until the end of the questions, thus remaining completely defenseless to enemy fire. However, the total absence of a multiplayer mode leaves a little bitterness in the mouth: if there is an intense cooperative option in the PC and console version, Sam Fisher is always alone on the iPhone and iPod Touch.
