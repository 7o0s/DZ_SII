{"name": "Wings Over Europe - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wings-over-europe-recensione.html", "text": "Some news, many problems The three campaigns available offer a rather original mission system: based on a narrative outline and a series of established objectives, the number of enemies and many of the dangerous situations that you will face will be randomly generated; in this way the user is forced to prepare for any eventuality, not being able to count on the simple mnemonic repetition of what was done previously. The variety is good: most of the time you will have to shoot down enemies, but there are moments in which to escort your companion in difficulty or carry out dangerous reconnaissance in enemy territory. On paper, and only on paper, the interludes that precede any action on the field should have been exciting and profound. In fact, a briefing has been inserted in which to choose which pilot, among those present in a pre-packaged roster, has the most suitable characteristics to face this or that task: the current physical shape, the preferred atmospheric condition and other elements such as the more or less great skill in shooting or in performing reckless maneuvers, however, they do not particularly affect the gameplay, ending up being superfluous. There are a dozen vehicles available in total, including the famous F-15 Eagle, A-10 Thunderbolt and F-100 Super Saber, each with the aesthetic and handling characteristics that set them apart. The guide is rather simulative, even if adjustable at will in the options, and it will take several hours to fully master all the commands assigned to the keyboard. The decision to eliminate the take-off and landing phases from each mission, which are usually complex and therefore very rewarding to complete, is perplexing. The average difficulty of the title is quite high and always requires great concentration, otherwise the enemy MIGs will be quickly killed, who seem to be able to count on greater resistance. Group flight The multiplayer mode is inevitable with which to undertake reckless flight actions together with other players. However, the mere possibility of being able to participate in games via LAN or the Internet is not in itself a note of merit, and Wings Over Europe is proof of this. There are two modes: the classic deathmatch renamed dogfight for the occasion, and the cooperative version of the missions already proposed by the campaigns; in both cases the maximum number of players allowed is 4. The huge problem is the absence of a game search engine, which forces you to make a direct IP to IP connection; this gap is marginal if you play within a home network, while it is extremely penalizing for those, it is easy to imagine most, who want to challenge each other online. Unfortunately, the client dedicated to solving this problem, specially created by some enthusiasts for Wings Over Vietnam, does not work either. Some bugs that close the application during very long loads should also be reported, however nothing that cannot be resolved with a patch. Longevity is quite good thanks to the high level of customization of both campaigns and quick matches, which can be modeled according to the player's needs in every detail: the mentality adopted by the opponents, the extent of support from allies and the precise year in which the clash takes place, just to name a few options. Smoke signals Graphically it is certainly not possible to be impressed by the work done by Third Wire, the predominant feeling will be that of having in your hands an old title of at least a couple of years. The aircraft models are faithful to the originals but have been made with a small number of polygons, while textures that are not at all defined have been applied to the ground which make it unpresentable below a certain altitude. Not even the color palette convinces, too desaturated, and the effects, the clouds of smoke caused by the explosions seem to come out of a cartoon. On the other hand, the layout of the instrumentation and indicators useful on the fly, which are positioned at the corners of the screen without disturbing the view, are good. Owners of non-latest generation computers will be happy to know that Wings Over Europe can also be played with a Pentium III 650 MHz, 256 MB of Ram and a dedicated video card with 32 MB of Vram. The sound reaches the sufficiency, thanks to the variety of sounds produced by the different planes and weapons, but lacks a musical accompaniment worthy of the name: the music is few and uninspired. Conclusions Summing up, Wings Over Europe is not completely convincing mainly due to a large number of imperfections that denote little care: the decisions made during the briefings do not have a yessignificant impact on the gameplay, the multiplayer is poorly organized and lacking in options and the experience is mutilated in the take-off and landing phases. Thus, interesting ideas end up being overshadowed, above all the idea of randomizing the main elements of the missions. Technically the comparison with other recent productions is deficient, due to graphics that are too rough and poor in details. A product for a few enthusiasts therefore, for all the others the advice is to shift their attention and savings to products of other caliber. Pros Ever-changing missions Three campaigns and 12 flyable planes Cons Rough multiplayer Lots of poor gameplay aspects Technically outdated Flight simulators are certainly a niche genre. Complex to develop and not supported by legions of fans as often happens for first-person shooters and real-time strategy games; they hardly manage to tickle the imagination of developers and manufacturers. This immobility is almost total in the products that emulate the thrill of flying a civil plane - Flight Simulator is the undisputed master of the scene - while in the war field someone still tries to try their hand at the enterprise. This is the case of the guys from Third Wire, whose series Wings Over aims to retrace some of the bloodiest historical moments of the last century: after the first episode dedicated to the Vietnam conflict, it is now the turn of the Cold War, between the 60s, 70s and 80s. The plot that unfolds during the missions is not very original, resulting in a pretext in order to combine an air combat with the next: you will have to play the role of a pilot who is part of a special NATO group, at that time fighting with the 'Soviet Union.", "date": "2006-11-23", "grade": null}
