{"name": "Doodle God Universe", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/doodle-god-universe-recensione.html", "text": "It has been a while since the old ~god games~, a term that was practically coined to catalog Peter Molyneux's games such as Populous, have not shown themselves so much on the scene and the review of Doodle God Universe can at least bring those back particular atmospheres, even if here we are decidedly far from the structural complexity of Bullfrog games and derivatives. JoyBits' work comes from a long series that began in 2010 with a wide range of mixes in different fields, but they are essentially casual titles, very far from the concept of divine management that one might think of when considering simulations and deities. Doodle God Universe, in particular, finds its good place within Apple Arcade, because it is an extremely simple and structured title to be free-to-play, but which in this case does not even suffer the negative influences of this type of distribution. Doodle God Universe is based on the association of pairs of elements to create others It's not easy to categorize it as a standard video game: it's a sort of pastime that requires, in the limit, a little imagination and inductive ability, but which represents something extremely casual to fit into the classic video game categories. This does not mean that it is a trivial title or devoid of any interest even for those looking for something more substantial, given that the search for associations for the creation of the world, at the basis of the gameplay, still requires a certain ability to think about the connections between different elements and on cause-effect relationships. However, where logic does not arrive, it is possible to go forward simply by groping, touching elements at random or almost, which could easily mortify anyone who expected some depth in the management of complex elements from such premises, because the Doodle series offers much more . As a creator deity There are some different game modes, which mostly offer different contexts or challenges of various kinds with the community, but basically the game always works in the same way: in the role of a creator deity, we find ourselves having to populate a planet by associating different elements among them, gradually bringing out more and more possibilities and addends to be combined in a more or less logical way. It starts from the basic elements such as earth, air, water and fire and from the initial association of these all the other objects and creative fields are progressively obtained, thus trying to bring life to an initially barren and deserted planet. simply based on the association of two elements: it is a question of choosing two broader categories (the basic elements, plants, animals, energy, technology and much more) and combining a couple of objects that are inside of the various fields, thus trying to find the right association capable of forming a new element/object/creature/concept. We are always dealing with sums between two addends, therefore there are no particularly daring combinations to think of and experiment with, which somewhat flattens the research: beyond the logical pairings, others are less clear but in general it is possible simply to proceed at random to find the new elements, considering that the combinations between two objects are many but easy to find even without great reasoning. The creations do not follow a chronological or realistic pattern, so it is possible to see common or very strange things popping up Although many associations derive from scientific bases (at least as logic), Doodle God Universe is a game that doesn't take itself very seriously, also including mythological and legendary creatures in the total of possible creations, abstract concepts and other elements that denote a certain irony of fund, which on the other hand also emerges from the quotations with which the new discoveries we make are welcomed, which range between high philosophy and popular culture. Every time something new is created, we also witness its placement on the earth's surface, with the changes that this entails in the appearance of the planet, represented with a rather clean low poly style but also strangely distant from the cartoonish and somewhat caricatured spirit which distinguishes all the other phases of the game.", "date": "2021-07-25", "grade": "6.8"}
