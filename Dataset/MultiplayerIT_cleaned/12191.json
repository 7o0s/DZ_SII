{"name": "Wartech Senko no Ronde - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wartech-senko-no-ronde-recensione.html", "text": "The importance of a good defense The concept, albeit unchanged from the aforementioned ~games~, makes use of all the evolution of the shooter genre without regard for vertical, horizontal and even oblique orientation. We can therefore count on swarms of Macross-style missiles, laser beams of embarrassing diameter, lightning bolts and every type of futuristic projectile imaginable, all of which literally saturate the screen. As a pleasant addition, to underline the affinity with the fighting game genre, we have a provision for two melee attacks. The first is a normal three-hit combo that throws the opponent away from us and the second is accomplished by pressing the secondary attack after a sprint and is a quick blow useful both for countering particularly dangerous enemies at short distances, and for finishing a fleeing opponent. Each character then has a barrage technique, or a move which, depending on the mech, damages at short and medium distance and is able to protect us for the duration of the execution of the technique. swarms of Macross-style missiles, embarrassing diameter laser beams, lightning bolts, thunderbolts and every type of futuristic projectile imaginable The importance of a good defense Three other defenses join the barrage technique: that is, an energy shield that is not too effective, but which can be used both in movement and in combat, an expansion shield of limited duration but able to protect against any attack and finally the possibility of spinning madly the left analog to escape the melee combo or slowing or paralyzing techniques. In the role of a Boss In truth, and here we enter the thorny area of balancing, some characters are able to use an unstoppable attack, a pleasure precluded to other avatars, which leads to decidedly irritating situations. However let's temporarily leave out the player versus player, currently difficult to implement through Live which tends to respond spades, to talk about the last and greatest peculiarity of Wartech Senko No Ronde. Let's start from afar: in large letters, on the packaging and on each Ubisoft promo, we read the acronym B.O.S.S. Unfortunately we don't understand what the acronym is but what is clear is that it transforms each character into a relative boss, clearly and rightly inspired by the historical bosses of the shoot'em up genre, and which perhaps has the dots not to be confused with the Boss Mode, or the famous macro used in offices around the globe to hide illegal activities from the boss in the workplace. After the embarrassing joke we just have to talk about the bar, because obviously there is a bar, and obviously it is a bar that loads, but be careful, because the availability of the B.O.S.S. mode does not depend on it. The bar simply decides the energy available to spend during the aforementioned mode. Instead, in the lower left, a splendid B, which recalls the small icon of the Smart Bombs also typical of scrolling shooters, will indicate the availability of this mode. Obviously without energy it is impossible to activate this special ability and with low energy it is inadvisable to do so, which should suggest what Wartech's main strategy is. Our task is therefore to survive as much as possible and load the aforementioned bar which, obviously, is consumed by activating the two basic shields, information which, in turn, should suggest the importance of avoiding enemy attacks using the barrage mode or with skillful use of the sprint. Definitely Wartech is all here, both in single player and in multiplayer. The level of challenge is obviously higher in the second case even if some characters are decidedly more robust and versatile than others and possess, both in B.O.S.S. that in standard mode, magnificent unstoppable laserons, and the feeling that the imbalance is not just a matter of poor practice has remained with us even after a large number of games with human opponents. In any case, the multiplayer mode offers a fair amount of fun thanks to the dynamism and variety of situations generated by the large number of moves, countermoves, parries and super attacks. Unfortunately the single player does not differ much from the multiplayer and offers nothing more apart from a narrow story, a couple of manga-style tables, and a couple of rather poor bosses with a decidedly low degree of challenge. Furthermore, the concept of the game, although relatively innovative and spectacular at first glance, is simple, limited and in the long run does not hold the comparison with a pure and challenging shoot'em up or with a calibrated fighting game that boasts about fifty techniques for each character . explosions and laser shotsborder on flat as the subwoofer is sent silently into retirement Definitely Then there are Wartech factors that leave a lot to be desired. The soundtrack is very reminiscent of the era in which the now outdated midi dominated and features some dull pieces that do not fit with the furious and combative nature of the game. Explosions and laser shots border on flatness and while the subwoofer is silently retired, the little Japanese voices that accompany some offensive techniques become irritating after a couple of matches. The graphic aspect, absolutely excellent as regards particle effects, lights and colors, unfortunately presents unconvincing models, devoid of any texture and dramatically poor. Comment A good idea and a distinctly Japanese title are elements that can tickle oriental shoot'em up lovers looking for something new, but which will hardly satisfy the average player or anyone looking for a title capable of offering challenge and entertainment of a good standard. The overall picture is that of a good Xbox Live Arcade title. The main problem is that it is sold at full price in stores and, frankly, we find it difficult to recommend it to anyone who is not super passionate about anime and shoot'em up. Pros: A good idea. Interesting multiplayer. An orgy of explosions. Lovers of Japanese shoot'em ups should check it out. Cons: Value for money. Skimpy single player. Spartan polygonal models. Soundtrack. Goals 360 Unlocking the Senko no Ronde achievements is pretty easy. Most come from the single player mode and it is sufficient to complete the story mode with each character and sip, again for each character, all ten Score Attack matches from which we will get the points even if defeated by the final boss. Unlocking Live-related objectives seems just as simple, the difficult thing is to convince Wartech's matchmaking to show us the games in progress and give us the opportunity to participate in them. Wartech Senko no Ronde is the new creature by G.Rev, authors of the appreciated Border Down, and is distributed for the occasion by Ubisoft which is the standard-bearer of a distinctly Japanese title presented on a distinctly Western machine. First of all a premise: we are dealing with an atypical game, which, just to clarify, also has potential. Moreover, it is a rare case, or rather a porting from a coin op, and this is a definition that we don't often write anymore. Having said that, we specify that the shootem up / fighting game hybrid between mechs, aircraft, powered armor and so on, despite being a not exactly widespread playful genre, is not a new concept in any case. Digging into culture, we find hints of it even in Gibson, the writer, and it is something that exists in the common imagination, presenting itself for decades in every film that claims cyberpunk. But even in video games it has quite ancient roots, precisely in what we could call, without offense, little games, where the first multiplayer allowed two funny spartan-made aircraft to spin happily and shoot a monochromatic candy made up of a few pixels.", "date": "2007-06-18", "grade": null}
