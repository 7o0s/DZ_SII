Here then is that for the debut on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Matsuyama and the other guys on the development team took a step back returning to the roots of the series, eliminating some of the aspects of the gameplay that Revolution players didn't like, focusing heavily on the spectacularity of the action thanks to the generational leap and above all by abandoning any ambition for alternative plots created specifically for video games, remaining as faithful as possible to the pages of the manga. All premises that have been fully satisfied and that have made Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 an extremely interesting title, as always a must for anyone who is passionate about the adventures of Naruto and the other ninjas who appeared on Shonen Jump. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 does not disappoint expectations and is confirmed as a must for fans The end and a new beginning Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is structured in two different modes: History and Adventure, to be tackled strictly in this order as the second bases its narrative on events following the conclusion of the first. The development team has in fact decided to downsize the main mode compared to the previous chapter, making it last much less and eliminating any exploratory phase which instead becomes the backbone of the Adventure structure. On a narrative level, we're going to retrace the entire last arc of the glorious ninja epic created by Kishimoto in fifteen years of publications, reliving the end of the saga of the Fourth Ninja War left unfinished by the third chapter. The epilogue then makes a story in itself, recalling events from the film The Last: Naruto the Movie which, given the high rate of spoilers and the lack of marketing in Italy, we avoid mentioning to spoil the surprise. Suffice it to say that, basically, The Last is the tenth film released on the ninja of the Leaf village, but it is the first to be an official part of the Naruto saga, connecting all the events narrated up to the last chapter of the manga and what will happen next in this rich comic universe. We can therefore say that if the third videogame chapter had left us with a bitter taste in the mouth for being ended with many outstanding issues, Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 experiences a crescendo of exaltation and adrenaline, up to the last epic battle that closes both the story mode and Kishimoto's manga, leaving us fully satisfied. In the title, the developers take up the thread starting from the memory of an ancient battle, which took place shortly after the founding of the Leaf Village and already seen in the demo released in December. After Hashirama Senju was elected First Hokage, Madara Uchiha left the village that he himself had helped to found, seeking revenge against the ninja of the Senju clan and returning only after being able to tame the Nine-Tailed Fox, the most powerful among the tailed beasts. The clash between two demons that unleash their immense power is of unprecedented violence, so as to give rise to the Valley of the Epilogue, a symbolic place also in the voracious rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke. The five chapters that form the main campaign therefore wind around the figure of Madara and that of Tobi / Obito digging into the past of both and in the relationships with the other ninja of Konoha, obviously including the reasons that led them to unleash this devastating conflict in which we will see Naruto and an increasingly powerful Sasuke engaged. There will also be all the excellent supporting actors, from Sakura and Kakashi, up to Gai, Rock Lee, Orochimaru and all four of the Hokage, called from death to try to stem the immense power of the TenCode. Playstation 4 trophies Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 offers 50 trophies, most of which are related to completing the story mode missions with an S rank. Lacking any reference to online, collect the 32 bronze trophies, 16 silver and the the only gold to obtain Platinum does not seem an impossible feat for Naruto lovers, who will surely have to face the most demanding fights several times, exhausting all their chakra. To the adventure! Each chapter includes one or more battlesie which, as per tradition, are accompanied by introductory and final films of excellent workmanship, which will delight all fans of the adventures of the blond ninja. In this sense, the only flaw is the excessive prolixity of some cutscenes, really very long in certain passages when compared to the actual game time. It took us about eight hours to complete the story, but in some chapters before and after a short battle there are also ten minutes of spun videos, which certainly do not help the decidedly too staid general rhythm. On the other hand, the variety is excellent, guaranteed by three types of battles: we go from boss fights, during which we control or face one of the powerful tailed beasts, to normal battles where we face an opponent in a three-dimensional arena accompanied by a maximum of two support characters . Finally, there are group battles where, before entering the actual fight against the main opponent, we have dozens of opponents to kill without using supreme techniques and awakenings. The heterogeneity of the characters to control and the alternation of spectacular battles filled with ~quick time events~ and interactive actions remains the flagship of the Story mode, never boring and always exciting when you hold the pad in your hands. For each meeting there are then the battle conditions to be completed in order to obtain Ninja Treasures, in addition to the Factors and Secret Actions to unlock dialogues and special scenes that give an even richer outline to each fight by fishing with both hands in the past of the protagonists. Once the Story is over, we then move on to Adventure, a ~free~ exploration mode that kicks off at the end of the Fourth Ninja War, when peace has returned. In this case we will be called upon to solve the quests that are assigned to us by the various characters, taking Naruto, Sakura and Hinata around the many villages and locations that are the protagonists of the various sagas of the manga in which we will not fail to relive old battles by unlocking the Crystals of Memory. Each destination can be reached via teleportation since there is no real open world to connect the various areas, and even the cities are nothing more than reproductions accessible in a very limited way and scattered with non-player characters useful for completing a mission or for entrusting us with new ones . Beyond secondary tasks such as breaking a certain number of boxes and vases, finding a lost cat or delivering an important message, these are mostly battles that can also become quite interesting, elevating this mode a little from the simple filler function . Then there is the Free Clash, where you can try your hand at survival modes or in various types of Championships and Tournaments by testing your skills against artificial intelligence at maximum difficulty. An excellent gym before diving into the online game, which in addition to the classic clash offers limited-time events that will only start in a few weeks, but we hope they offer a good variety of content. Finally, all the ninja trophies and Ryo accumulated in battle are spent in the Bandai Emporium, equipped with all kinds of collectibles to customize the fighters or your online avatar. It's all about Jutsu In addition to the final moves and the interactive actions, the spectacularity of the battles passes above all through the dynamism of the gameplay, which although it remains unchanged in the structures compared to the previous chapters, is strong in some decidedly appreciated improvements. The combat system is always intuitive and not particularly deep in the use of ninja arts and supreme techniques, but still requires proper attention in the management of the chakra bar and above all of the slots for the Substitution Technique, always essential to get out of the combos of the opponents and avoid massive damage. The dynamics of battle have been slightly changed with the reintroduction of wall running, which now works even while one player is on the wall and the other is attacking from the ground. Also interesting is the interaction between the attacks and the ninja's clothing, which deteriorates due to the long-term effects of some techniques: for example, if a fireball hits a wrestler it burns him, progressively damaging his armor until it breaks. but the effect can be stemmed by running through the water. This is a change not only aimed at the ability to absorb damage, but it is also aesthetic and deserving especially on the occasion of the battles against the bosses which constantly change as the blows suffered increase. However, the most interesting introduction is posability to switch fighters during matches just like we were in a tag team. In the previous chapters, in fact, a main wrestler was selected and then two other support fighters to be called up if necessary with the back buttons: once they took to the field, they automatically performed a predefined technique whose effectiveness was mainly based on the timing with which they were called in. cause. In Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 this mechanic has been further enriched and in addition to the quick entry the player can freely control each member of the team by selecting them with the left analog stick. The team can therefore fight in a more fluid way, land bigger combos by switching the character on the run and inflict even more damage. Each can use basic attacks and Ultimate Jutsu, with life and chakra bars shared among team members as well as Awakening mode. This system enhances the player's ability to control each fighter and if certain characters are selected that have actually had a link in the history of the manga, such as the three members of Squad 7 formed by Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura, finishing moves are unlocked themed combinations. In this specific case, for example, the whole team uses the Recall Technique with the blond ninja summoning Gamakichi, and the other two respectively Aoda and Katsuyu. Obviously, in full Ultimate Ninja Storm style, the animations are even more spectacular with the gigantic creatures hurling themselves against the enemies to close the match with a crescendo of very powerful blows and exhilarating explosions. There is certainly no shortage of combinations, given that at the moment the roster has eighty characters to choose from - with more arriving via DLC - but it must be emphasized that some, for example Naruto and Sasuke, have numerous variations. Joy for the eyes Finally, the technical sector, which as every time we return to praise for its incredible resemblance to the animated counterpart. The work done by CyberConnect2 in terms of cel shading rendering and ability to bring the choreographic power of Naruto's fights and their intensity from paper to screen is absolutely perfect. The transition to the latest home console hardware has allowed a further leap forward in the production quality of an absolutely phenomenal title from this point of view. The fluidity has benefited from this by not highlighting problems of frame rate drops, but it is above all the light effects, explosions and particles that surprise for clarity and variety, contributing to making each jutsu and final move even more grandiose and spectacular. However there is still some aliasing on some polygonal models mainly due to some details related to the clothing of the characters and the work done in the creation of the locations of the Adventure mode remains insufficient, above all for the use of flat and poor in detail textures, as well as for the lack of a real interaction with the elements of the scenario. The sound counterpart is also reconfirmed as excellent, with well-made English and Japanese dubbing - subtitles are mandatory for those who don't want to give up on Italian - and a soundtrack in line with the oriental features of the anime.", "date": "2016-02-04", "grade": "8.5"}
