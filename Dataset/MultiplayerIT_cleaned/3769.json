{"name": "Dawn of Man", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dawn-of-man-recensione.html", "text": "Dawn of Man whose review you are reading follows in the wake of the great urban-themed management games, typical of the PC world, focusing on a particular period of human history, namely prehistory. So don't expect to take hold of a civilization or to take it to the conquest of space, or even to manage who knows what technologies. Here you stop much earlier and at most what you can get is a well-organized village, made of stone huts with wooden and thatched roofs, inhabited by men capable of cultivating the fields and sacrificing animals to the gods . Gameplay Dawn of Man begins with the selection of the territory in which to build our village. The choice is not only aesthetic, but determines the level of difficulty of the game: the more the territory chosen is rich in resources, the easier it will be to progress and make our village grow. The elements to take into account are watercourses for fishing, woods for wood and game, and mountainous areas for rocks and other raw materials. As in all titles of the genre, the goal to be pursued is essentially that of development. At the beginning there are few inhabitants and fragile and easily perishable infrastructures, and the first thing to do is observe the territory and define the activities of the village. In general, the interface offers two possibilities for intervention for each job: direct selection, or positioning of job areas. In the first case you have to click on the resource and ask for it to be collected, while in the second you create an area where our prehistoric little men will automatically carry out the prescribed activity, automating the process. The entire system of obtaining raw materials works the same way throughout the game, with the only discriminating factor being the availability of useful tools to obtain advanced ones. For example, to cut down trees you must first have discovered and created hatchets, while to dig rocks you need pickaxes. In purely technological terms, the progression offered by Dawn of Man is purely logical and managed entirely by the player: each achievement yields progress points which, accumulated in the right number, can be spent to unlock new technologies. For example, at the beginning our men have very weak wooden weapons, useful only for hunting small and practically harmless animals, but as the game progresses, the discovery of new tools to collect and work with better quality raw materials can be create more resistant and effective weapons, with which to attack stronger and more dangerous animals, such as mammoths, which yield much more in terms of food and resources (bones, skins and so on). The improvement of the equipment also allows you to reach the most remote areas of the immense maps, where obviously other materials are found. Over the hours, the economy of our village evolves and from the mere exploitation of the surrounding area our men manage to develop agriculture, sheep farming, manufacturing and all those activities that characterized prehistoric civilizations. The same goes for other aspects of society, such as religion. Our men thus go from worshiping a stick with skulls planted on it to elaborate a more complex religion, centered on Stonehenge-style stone structures, erected using boulders dragged thanks to a system of sledges. Easy In strictly simulation terms, Dawn of Man does an excellent job of rendering the issues faced by the first humans to be able to survive. At the beginning you have to contend above all with predators, hunger and tiredness, but as the hours go by new difficulties emerge, such as groups of marauders who want to raid the village. Unfortunately, the military side is one of the weakest in Dawn of Man. Basically, facing the marauders is reduced to raising the alarm, to bring together all the available inhabitants in defense of the structures and resources. Sure, you can build palisades, watchtowers, and you can train dogs to have a first defence, but in general, attacks are managed as individual events to be overcome and not as a structural problem to be organized against. The defect emerges above all over the long distance, when you are essentially left with nothing to do. The lack of long-term goals is another of Dawn of Man's shortcomings. Of course, it's a city builder and therefore one of the main pleasures is to build and expand our village. Unfortunately the era represented has obvious limits in terms of variety and possibilities of evolution and in a few hours it is possible to build the wholebuildable. Incidentally: the habitable buildings are few and in the advanced stages only one type is built, while the productive buildings are a handful, as well as the religious ones. Let's say that Dawn of Man runs out in about ten hours, with the various maps that only slightly increase the level of challenge, without however changing the actual progression. Sure, the formula is more pleasure and everything is played again willingly, but in the long run it becomes an activity for its own sake, which always flows in the same way and doesn't even offer the aesthetic taste of majesty, typical of the genre. Besides, Dawn of Man is really easy. Let's explain: at the beginning it seems to offer a good level of challenge, but as soon as you get to the heart of the development, the gameplay literally becomes a walk. There are some interesting events, such as pasture epidemics or climatic variations, but there is never anything that jeopardizes the work done... also because the game system tends to automate everything, with our prehistoric friends who they are very efficient in bailing themselves out practically on their own in almost any situation. The hope is that events and dangers will be added with future updates, but for now the game is this one and nothing can be done about it.", "date": "2019-03-15", "grade": "S.V."}
