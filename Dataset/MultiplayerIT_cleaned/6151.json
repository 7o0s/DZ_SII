From Final Fight to The Punisher, passing through Cadillacs & Dinosaurs, Alien vs Predator and not forgetting the game dedicated to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the beautiful forays into the world of Dungeons & Dragons, there were so many ways an honest player could face hordes of increasingly tough enemies treating themselves with roast chickens. Streets of Rage 2 represents one of the most classic examples of this golden age, embodying within itself all the basic characteristics of the genre: the possibility of choosing different characters ranging from the big and strong guy to the fast and weak one, the presence of enemies of various types, without forgetting the inevitable female opponent with a whip, tough bosses who jump everywhere and obviously a level set in an elevator where enemies fall from above. These and many other features make it a canonical game, a way forward and one of the finest examples of what was played 30 years ago. The dualism Final Fight, which was exclusive to Nintendo for consoles, and Streets of Rage, which was released for the Mega Drive, was one of the most important topics of any classroom, garden or after-school club in the 90s. The similarity between the two was evident and on the one hand there was the pride of having finished first, the second could show the cooperative mode, which was missing from the home Final Fight. A precarious balance that was definitively compromised when SEGA launched a second chapter, full of improvements. Streets of Rage 2 returns to Nintendo 3DS and is as challenging and beautiful as you remembered The big one, the fast one and all the others Therefore, the move to re-propose Streets of Rage 2 for Nintendo 3DS is absolutely sensible, given that it allows more seasoned players to relive one of the toughest, most visionary and well-made fighting games of the time and gives the younger ones a test bench on which test your credentials as a hardcore gamer. Streets of Rage 2 is the classic story where a mysterious villain kidnaps someone and someone else is forced to cross the whole city to save him. In this case the cruel ~Mr. X~ holds Adam Hunter prisoner, already seen in the first chapter, and Axel and Blaze, also old acquaintances, will come to his aid, with the collaboration of Skate and Max. The four embody the classic stereotypes of the fighting game character: Max is huge, slow and powerful, Axel is the more balanced character, Skate the agile and weak one and Blaze is somewhere in between. There are three buttons used to dispense justice with fists: the jump, the attack and the special move. Obviously the latter consumes some energy, but it does much more harm than the normal attack, which can be combined with the jump or other movements to perform more powerful and effective moves, essential for more advanced levels. There's also no shortage of grips and projections, even if to do them you'll have to get close to your opponent without getting hit, so it's best to use them on weaker enemies. During the game we will have to face all kinds of enemies: robot wrestlers, samurai, ninjas, thai boxers, aliens inspired by the Ridley Scott saga (yes) and to do so we will also be able to count on weapons such as knives, katanas and iron pipes, while the energy we lack can be obtained by eating apples and roast chickens, as tradition dictates. Full of nostalgia Visually M2 has added a small touch of nostalgic class: if we want we can decide whether to play in ~normal~ mode, i.e. with clean graphics without distortions or using the ~classic~ visual, i.e. slightly blurred and deformed at the edges, as if we were facing to an old TV. For greater completeness, the developers also let us choose whether to play the American or Japanese version of the game, while the soundtrack has remained totally unchanged. In addition to 3D, M2 has included some new modes: the first is the Rage Relay Mode, which allows you to decide an order of choice between the four characters, so that, when you lose a life, you have to choose another fighter. It's a great way to force yourself to try all fighting styles, learning to adapt to the situation and spice up the game. For those who just can't make it through the toughest fights, there is also a ~Casual~ mode where enemies will die the first time they hit the ground, so a jump kick is enough to kill even the toughest boss. If even this is not enough, once the game is over the ~Fists of Death~ mode will be unlocked in which it will be enougha single shot to kill each enemy and we will be able to feel like new Kenshiro. It may be fun at first but the truth is that the gaming experience inevitably comes out depleted. The only real flaw of this conversion perhaps concerns the control system, it is undoubtedly precise but perhaps a little clunky compared to the classic arcade stick and requires some getting used to before being used at its best. Obviously there is double, or the possibility for two players to share the gaming experience with a local connection. It won't be like fighting shoulder to shoulder in front of the same screen and the game needs to be played on both Nintendo 3DS systems, but it's still a fun experience. If desired, there is also the ~Duel Mode~ in which you can collide with a friend of ours, but cooperation remains the best way to share the game with someone. The 3D effect The development team, which is the original one of M2, did not have an easy time introducing 3D in Streets of Rage 2, but the result is definitely excellent. It is possible to choose between a three-dimensional effect that goes deep or one that ~pops out of the screen~ and in both cases the effect is convincing, the characters detach themselves perfectly from the background and, thanks to the improved 3D of the new Nintendo DS, they give a decidedly new touch to the game.", "date": "2015-07-31", "grade": "9.0"}
