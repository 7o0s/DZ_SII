{"name": "Lair - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lair-recensione.html", "text": "Dragon's Lair The player takes on the role of Rohn, a soldier in Asylia's army, who has been at war with the Mokai for too long: when a peace treaty is finally about to be signed with the enemy, which will allow the population to live in peace, a betrayal unexpected will lead Rohn to ride his dragon and fight against enemies, but also to re-evaluate the reasons for the battle and the faction with which he is aligned. The plot of Lair is simple, but interesting, with a decidedly Hollywood feeling, and the excellent cutscenes (dubbed in Italian) help to make the feeling of playing a movie. In fact, at first glance Lair definitely looks like a movie: the overall artistic quality is impressive, the creatures are beautifully done, the various characters are excellently modeled and animated, and the locations are breathtaking. Riding a dragon that flies over a capital and the sea that surrounds it while the sunset creates splendid plays of color is a fantastic experience, which however does not last long: the moment you start fighting, the first technical problems appear. Unstable frame rate, questionable physics, fluctuating textures... Although the amount of polygons that move on the screen is definitely impressive (we are talking about hundreds of soldiers fighting and dozens of dragons flying and spitting fire left and right) one realizes that Factor 5 simply couldn't handle the engine as it probably hoped. The scenic effect is excellent, the sensation of participating in a titanic battle is palpable, in general Lair satisfies from a graphic point of view, but a careful and more critical eye cannot fail to notice all those small technical defects that make the title far away from the masterpiece that should have been: the inconsistency of Lair is such that some stages leave you stunned by the general care and the spectacular visual rendering (this is the case of the gigantic leviathan) while the immediately following ones seem to belong to a different game. Fortunately, the sound sector remains consistent from start to finish: excellent dubbing and extremely realistic sound effects, but above all the soundtrack is truly splendid, which has nothing to envy to the most recent mega-film productions. Varied, full of atmosphere and perfectly suited to the game phases or non-interactive sequences, the music in Lair does not disappoint and, on the contrary, improves the general experience. Rise from the Lair? The hot potato, of course, is the gameplay: it's no secret that the dragon production Factor 5 closely mimics the Rogue Squadron series dedicated to Star Wars, and the dragon you control in Lair is none other than an X-Wing. The style of play adopted is the same, the various stages in fact present a series of mini-missions that must be completed in sequence, introduced by numerous and stressful cutscenes that indicate the new objectives to be achieved. The action should feel frenetic, sometimes it is, other times it's just plain frustrating to follow the logical thread of the stage, especially when the various tasks are quite obscure, so much so that sometimes they are completed indirectly by our AI-managed allies, without being understood what was to be done and how. These are sporadic occurrences, however, and Lair is deliberately structured in a love-it-hate-it-it kind of interactive movie. The real problem is the control one has over Rohn and his dragon. The myth has it that Lair's controls are bad: in reality, they are extremely subjective and situational. The main flaw is a response to Sixaxis input which is sometimes slightly slow, but the control system is enjoyable, even if it requires some time to be assimilated and managed naturally: it is perhaps more the complexity of the actions required to manage the dragon, i.e. the combination of pressing the various keys with the movements of the Sixaxis, which makes it frustrating to master Lair in the first game sessions. In reality, one wonders why Factor 5 did not limit itself to inserting a sacrosanct option that would allow us to control our dragon simply with the analog sticks: it would certainly have limited the negative response of critics and part of the more casual user. On the other hand, it is not only the questionable handling of our dragon that is the main flaw of our donut, but the real combat possibilities offered by Lair: essentially, our dragon can spit volleys of fireballs, fiery masses concentrate or the canonical extended incinerator breath. In general, aerial clashes force us to locate enemies, chase them and shoot them down, a task made difficult by the absurd lock-on system developed by Factor 5: in practice, our dragon ~hooksa~ the enemies autonomously, the only way to enjoy an aerial battle is to adapt and shoot accordingly. The dragons in flight can also be faced in extremely spectacular melee clashes, but triggering these confrontations is quite difficult, if not practically random On the ground, we can wipe out dozens of enemies with a few swipes or puffs of flame, and in that case the action becomes brutal, spectacular and unfortunately extremely chaotic, so much so that we sometimes find ourselves pressing buttons at random. sure, but also perplexing. Lair is full of intriguing and pleasant ideas, such as night infiltration avoiding telltale beams of light, and the very concept of participating in a war between flying dragons, facing humans, giant insects and monstrous sea serpents is the dream of every lover of fantasy and dragons in general: the variety of missions is consistent and getting used to the frequent cutscenes that interrupt the action, one remains satisfied in the long run by the spectacular ten hours required to complete the game. We would then have to go back to the missions already completed to obtain new medals by completing certain objectives, in pure Rogue Squadron style, but then it is up to the player and above all to his ability to adapt to the abstruse, but definitely not bad, control system. Comment In short, is the long-awaited Lair a bad game? No, it's actually an unfinished game. Whether or not it is true that Sony has put pressure on Factor 5 to launch such an eagerly awaited but decidedly to be refined product on the market, the fact remains that Lair has obvious technical shortcomings: beyond the fluctuating visual rendering, it is not uncommon to come across defects of various kinds that seem to be the aftermath of an incomplete version. The control system is certainly the thorniest element of Lair: extremely subjective, it still requires a good dose of practice to be appreciated, especially in open spaces, and is still very cumbersome in the most agitated game phases. A greater fluidity of the action during the missions and the possibility of controlling our dragon with the analog sticks would have made a good part of the technical defects practically superfluous, but of Lair we are left with the memory of a game that amazed us for two years, that could have been a lot but in the end it wasn't: it will be for next time, at least the basics are there. Pros Superb soundtrack Artistically great Interesting concept Cons Graphically choppy Control system not for everyone Feels like an unfinished game Lair is available for PlayStation 3. Lair is one of those games that should have been the flagship of the PlayStation 3 earlier this season. He had captivated us with the first photos, and those who know Factor 5 and its previous productions (above all, Rogue Leader and Rebel Strike on GameCube) had already seen in Lair a cinematic dragon-riding shooter: a decidedly fantastic idea, even if not exactly original. The first videos had left us speechless: epic battles between armies made up of foot soldiers and huge flying dragons, fantasy creatures galore and explosions everywhere, in splendid and evocative medieval-inspired settings: the release date announced, the wait it had become almost unbearable. With Lair, PlayStation 3 had to show its muscles and its technical capabilities, and Factor 5's game had to be a Killer Application, based above all on the new control system, completely linked to Sixaxis. But slowly this release date got more and more remote. Also because of Lair, the PlayStation 3 has earned jokes about delays that can now be compared to those about the police, the title of Factor 5 simply could not find a place in the release-list: there was always something to fix, revise, correct. The playable versions shown at various public and private events didn't convince users and critics, so down to work on the code again, to make the visual rendering stable and the controls more comfortable. Finally, we arrived in September. Here the story gets confused: legend has it that Sony imposed an irrevocable release date on Factor 5, despite the many aspects of the game to be reviewed and fixed. Lair was now too important, together with Heavenly Sword represented a sort of ~now or never~ to launch the console in the pre-Christmas period. And so, Factor 5 released a complete version of Lair, which first arrived in US stores... provoking decidedly mixed reactions: there are those who loved it, and those who hated it, but those belonging to the first category have never denied the reality of the facts, namely that Lair is one of those rare donuts without a hole. You eat it anyway, maybe it's even good, but it could have been much better.", "date": "2007-11-14", "grade": null}
