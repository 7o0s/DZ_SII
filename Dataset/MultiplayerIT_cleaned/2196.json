{"name": "Warrior Kings - E' tempo di eroi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warrior-kings-e-tempo-di-eroi-2.html", "text": "Warriors, Wizards and Farmers Well, as you have guessed from my dramatic pomposity, Warrior Kings, like any fantasy game worthy of the name, has a setting and a background of considerable depth and the world of Orbis itself has been written with an admirable abundance of details, attributing a name to each river, mountain or plain of this imaginary continent so similar to our Europe. To increase the involvement of the gaming experience, the fact also contributes to the fact that finding ourselves managing the character of Artos ~in-game~, we will have a real ~avatar~ on our hands which, if he dies in battle, will force us to reload the match. Of course it's not the first time we've seen something like this in an RTS, but in Warrior Kings this factor has been further accentuated and will play a strategically very important role, since Artos will be controlled for the duration of the game and over time it will grow stronger and more powerful, gaining different powers and abilities depending on the path followed. Let's remember, however, that WK is still a strategic title, with all that this entails in terms of gameplay. The second half of 2001 witnessed a notable boost in the RTS genre, and if until recently it seemed that the trend was to make products exclusively oriented towards combat strategy (at Ground Control just to be clear), placing in the background collection and management of resources, now it seems that we have now returned to our origins, and while the Blizzard-Style RTS seem increasingly intent on making ~a separate genre~, the impression is that we are trying to chase the success of Age of Empires. Warrior Kings also fits into this ~track~, but does so in a very personal way. For example, to collect food to feed the troops we will actually have to build farms, but they will be built near a village. The peasants then, after cultivating the wheat, will have to transport it to our headquarters and to do so it will be necessary to undertake a real route, using a cart that will be protected from enemy attacks! Other types of resources, such as stone for example, are collected in a more traditional way from the appropriate quarries, but in the case of gold instead, it will be possible to obtain it both directly and quickly from the mines, and to accumulate it by building commercial shops and employing personnel to inside them! In short, the management of the economy in Warrior Kings is rather articulated and complex, but not too laborious for this: once you become familiar with the interface and the automatisms of the game, you can easily dedicate yourself to the more properly warlike aspects, such as the production of troops , and of course to the confrontation with the enemy. Three armies, one King Contrary to the rest of the RTS we've had to deal with in recent years, in Warrior Kings there is no real selection of the faction to which we belong. We do have three possible sides, the Imperials, the Pagans and the Renaissance, but it will be depending on the choices what we will do during the game that our army will tend to evolve following one of these general models, based on our particular style of play. For those who are used to ~locking up~ in an impregnable base waiting for the enemy to make its first, fatal, move, it is advisable to develop the Imperial branch, which is more prone to defensive strategy and possesses very strong, albeit expensive, units. If, on the contrary, you prefer to attack the enemy first, exhausting him with repeated rushes of not too powerful but low-cost units, your choice will be for the Pagans. Finally, if you want to opt for something more innovative, the Renaissance is for you, since they have technologically advanced units, such as bombards, riflemen and so on. Naturally each ~race~ has its pros and cons, but in any case you will hardly find yourself following only and exclusively one of the three paths and we will be able to create original mixes, for example by combining the animosity of the Pagans with the use of gunpowder, or build temples for the summoning of little demons despite being sworn to the Empire. As is obvious, each branch of the tech tree will tend to exclude the others, once the maximum level has been reached, just as once the possibility of summoning the mighty Demons of the Pagans has been gained, it will no longer be possible to call upon the assistance of the Angel Michael or build the most efficient siege engines! Of course, depending on our conduct, the appearance of our army and deArtos himself will change significantly, going from the icon of cloying leader in silver armor surrounded by his crowd of white-clad knights, to an army of hooded cultists, gigantic devils and warriors in dark armor, at the head of which stands the image of a corrupted Artos, with fiery red skin and a flaming gaze. In addition to the peculiarities of the particular type of troops that we are going to deploy on the battlefield, it is also necessary to consider the importance of the formations in which to organize them, an element which was at the center of medieval war strategy. The wedge formations are particularly suitable for cavalry charges, while the defensive potential of the pikemen is highlighted in a careful circular ~porcupine~ arrangement. Other formations, on the other hand, do not directly affect the battlefield, but will make the movement of troops on the march easier. Exploration is in fact a fundamental element, not only for the consequent strategic knowledge of the territory but also for the resolution of the quests. Already because as our explorers enter the tortuous game maps (in Warrior Kings extensive use is made of heights, hills, mountains, etc.) they will be able to come across particular buildings or characters arranged for this purpose, who once questioned by the our Artos, they can entrust us with missions of various kinds. Whose rewards, equally heterogeneous, will range from a bonus to our hero's abilities to the gift of special units, technological advances or the acquisition of precious villages and related crops. It's all about image The graphics in Warrior Kings are truly a feast for the eyes. Not so much for the presence of stunning graphic effects, or rather because it is able to squeeze once and for all this blessed latest generation hardware that is emptying our wallets with embarrassing speed, but for the general realization of the same and for the overall vision which it is able to guarantee. I have already mentioned the presence of a particularly complex conformation of the terrain, and I assure you that the landscapes obtained are truly evocative and seem to have come out of a Turner painting. All this is reflected in an extremely incisive way on the gameplay. Take Warcraft3 for example; from what we have had the opportunity to taste of the beta, the maps, while presenting ~real~ heights and depressions, nonetheless develop in a fairly conventional way along the two dimensions, while Warrior Kings does not hesitate to insert crazy altitudes, gorges and canyons of depths and large enough to comfortably contain a vast army, and often you will find yourself in the situation of having to retreat under the rain of arrows from an enemy fortress that stands out on the top of an inaccessible mountain. As far as the actual design of the troops is concerned, many of the clashes that you will be able to face will seem to you as if you have just come out of a chronicle of The Lord of the Rings or from a healthy game of some tabletop wargames such as Warhammer and the like. The presence of such heterogeneous troops, different in shape, size and way of fighting, will catapult you in a few seconds into this accurately reconstructed fantasy world, where a column of mighty heavily armed knights can suddenly be forced to flee by the appearance of a demon Behemoth about ten meters high. The game doesn't even spare itself on details and at any moment it is possible to observe the rustling of the treetops, the stirring of the grain in the wind or the improvised ballets of some bird flying over the plain of our castle. Think that by zooming in it is even possible to distinguish the splinters of wood raised by the lumberjacks at work, not to mention the many small contour animations that affect the troops in motion or who simply stand ~immobile~ on guard. Promotion with full marks also for the sound: for once we find ourselves in the presence of a location worthy of the name, where the speaker does not give the impression he is reading a poem for the school drama essay, nor does the text on the screen show that plethora of spelling horrors that leaves in the air that notorious stench of ~machine translation software~ that has so often offended our delicate nostrils. Kudos to Microids. Only one will remain Of King of Warriors of course, certainly not of stegic titles, since lately they multiply like bacilli, yet I must admit that this Warrior Kings stands out from the crowd with remarkableand style, as well as being able to awaken in my sleepy brain a certain interest in the RTS genre Good graphics, excellent gameplay, original basic concept and hardware requirements that are far from unsustainable (but I hope you have stocked up on RAM memory in these months of fat cows). What else to add? The singleplayer campaign has 22 missions for a total of about 80 quests, and of course there will be the possibility of creating multiplayer games for up to 8 players via LAN and the Internet. Guys, if you love strategic games you have found your game... take advantage of it. The King of Warriors A deep gangrene was now gripping the Kingdom of the One God and the surrounding territories of the Empire of Orbis and Evil was well rooted in the leadership of the country in the person of a cruel and ambitious Supreme Pontiff who certainly did not do justice to the glorious tradition of remote times . It was in this period of turmoil that the Duke of Cravant became the new leader of those who refused to submit to the dictatorial yoke of the Pontiff, and perhaps under his leadership the Empire would have experienced a new era of peace and justice. But a well-orchestrated conspiracy unexpectedly led him to exile and death. Yet the hopes of the inhabitants of Orbis were not destined to go out so easily: a new hero would have gathered under his leadership the men still faithful to the ideals of the true Sacred Protector and to perpetrate revenge in the name of his deceased father. Yes, because the hero who would come to claim blood rights was the son of the Duke of Craven, the legitimate descendant of the ancient King Adam. He was Artos (any reference to existing facts or people is purely coincidental).", "date": "2002-03-14", "grade": null}
