The problem is that Alice does not remember anything about that place and the adventures that saw her protagonist, vanished in the maze of her memory like a long forgotten dream. The White Rabbit and the Dormouse secretly scrutinize her and wonder if she is really the little girl they met years before. The Underworld is falling apart because of the Red Queen, and the only person who can put an end to her reign of terror is Alice, who according to legend will don a magical armor and with the help of the sword Bigralace will defeat the terrible Ciciarampa, the huge dragon at the service of the queen. If Alice isn't Alice, however, that doesn't rule out the possibility that she could become one. Together with the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, the March Hare, the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat, the girl will certainly be able to recover her memories and draw from them the necessary determination to fulfill her destiny, in what will be remembered as the ~ joyful day~. Through the mirror The film adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, directed by the extraordinary Tim Burton, refers to the novels written by Lewis Carroll in terms of context and characters, but offers viewers a plot that is certainly different and in many ways more ~epic~ than the fairy tale for children that we all know. The tie-in developed by Etranges Libellules for Wii is immediately very faithful to the film, with Alice waking up in the Underworld in the animated introduction and being welcomed by the White Rabbit and the Dormouse. The two talking animals are not sure that the girl is the same one they met ten years ago, and so they decide to visit the Caterpillar to get confirmation. However, the Red Queen's army is lurking: made aware of Alice's return, the soldiers under the orders of the Knave of Hearts have been sent throughout the Underworld and their mission is to capture her and bring her to Rocca Tetra. In the game we control a character chosen from among those who accompany Alice in her new adventure, with a rose that is gradually enriched with new names: first the White Rabbit (who fights brandishing a heavy watch) and the Dormouse (armed with a pin), then the Marzolino hare (throwing plates and crockery at enemies), the Mad Hatter (armed with a sword) and the Cheshire Cat (who defends himself using his claws). We can switch from one character to another by simply pressing the C button on the Nunchuk, even in the nice cooperative multiplayer mode for two players (which can be activated or deactivated ~on the fly~), and it is a pity that this operation is not so immediate during situations more excited: to switch from the White Rabbit (the first character in the list) to the Cheshire Cat (the last), in fact, you have to press the button four times in succession. A problem that could be solved through the trivial implementation of a contextual selection menu. Alice in Wonderland puts puzzles at the center of its gameplay, and actually solving them using the various powers available is the most fun thing about the game. Since the roster of characters is constantly growing, through the scarce six hours it took us to complete the adventure, the puzzles to be solved and their complexity consequently increase. Magic powers and enchanted doors The White Rabbit has the power to control time: we can use it on elements of the scenario that turn blue when the pointer passes (controlled via the infrared system of the Wii-mote and useful for collecting bonuses and objects) by pressing the Z button and moving the controller in circles, like the hands of a clock. The Dormouse has a particular ability in fighting (especially with the power-up that doubles its speed) but does not boast magical powers, while the March Hare can use a powerful telekinesis to move even large objects: in this case the Wii-mote goes shaken in the direction indicated on the screen (with an annoying dead zone when moving to the left). The Mad Hatter possesses the most fascinating power of all, that of ~perspective~: once he has reached a raised point with respect to the scenario, he can literally modify reality by ~fitting~ elements of the background together and obtaining new paths from them. Finally, the Cheshire Cat has an equally interesting ability, namely that of making things disappear: objectsthey limit themselves to becoming invisible, but are actually transferred to a sort of parallel dimension and therefore no longer affect the plane of reality in which we find ourselves. The quantity and quality of the puzzles present in the game is really high, there are some particularly inspired ideas and it is natural to wonder if they are all Etranges Libellules sack flour or if they were taken from the film (the writer has not yet had the opportunity to see it to verify, unfortunately). The other elements of the gameplay, from the exploration (rather limited) to the fights, are a mere outline to the puzzles; the clashes with the troops of the Knave of Hearts, in particular, are rendered a minimum varied only by the presence of different types of soldiers, while our task is limited to continuously press the trigger B (deputy for the attack) until it's all over , possibly producing some dodging every now and then. The energy bar is shared among the various characters and is far from infinite, but dying in Alice in Wonderland is a very relative concept: a flash of light and we return to the attack, perhaps losing a few points but without having to start again a possible checkpoint. Was it also this accommodating solution that weighed on the total duration of the game? The doubt arises immediately, but the truth is that many sections of the game could have been enriched, you could focus a little more on the exploratory element and make more use of the scenarios, considering their beauty. Mezzanazza or Tortinsu? The technical sector of the game moves between ups and downs, but fortunately they are definitely the first to prevail. The cutscenes, equipped with animations reminiscent of the ~stop motion~ technique so dear to Burton, manage to be interesting and engaging, effectively playing the role of ~glue~ for the various sections and perfectly integrating the plot. The dubbing in Italian certainly helps, entrusted to the official voices of the film and therefore of great prestige: the acting is really excellent, with only a couple of not very ~convinced~ moments (probably attributable to a poorly detailed script, given the level of the actors), and the atmosphere is enriched accordingly. The music is also excellent, which together with the graphics manage to create a convincing Underworld, evocative in its landscapes, fascinating and almost never bare. The technical limitations of the Wii unfortunately prevent us from enjoying that ~visual richness~ which is the exclusive prerogative of some ~nextgen~ console and PC titles, but which would have made the Alice in Wonderland tie-in aesthetically closer to the film. In any case, one can't really complain: apart from Alice, whose face would have gained from a more ~cartoony~ characterization, the various characters boast excellent design, detailed polygonal models and good animations. The manual management of the view (controllable via the d-pad of the Wii-mote) unfortunately creates more of a headache, especially during the most crowded fights, and often puts the graphics engine a bit on the ropes, causing quite noticeable drops in the frame rate .", "date": "2010-03-12", "grade": "7.8"}
