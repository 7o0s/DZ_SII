Joe: The birth of Cobra marks the return of a brand born in the 60s that seemed to have been forgotten for some years now. The one linked to this famous toy line, in truth, has been a highly exploited brand since its creation, so much so that it even produced a successful animated series in the 80s. Obviously in 2009 it was certainly not credible to reproduce the original style of the characters, so that the Joes have undergone a careful restyling with the results that we can admire in the film ... and on our consoles. The G.I. tie-in Joe, as if to be faithful to its past origins, presents itself as a scrolling shooter, a genre that is in crisis as never before, crushed by the push of new-concept games and by a guilty inability to renew. Will the Global Integrated Joint Operating Entities have been able to improve its fortunes? Hey Joe The game asks us to impersonate various members of the G.I. Joe grappling with a criminal organization called Cobra. G.I. Joe, structured in numerous freely selectable and unlockable missions by progressing in the adventure, offers the player a minimalist and intuitive gameplay, as per the tradition of the genre. Progressing in the areas alongside a companion (it is possible to play cooperatively on the same console) we have to deal with enemy troops who face us in progressively more numerous and heterogeneous groups in offensive capabilities, the game action is summed up in a frenetic and continuous shooting that lasts until the end of the stage in a heavily linear way. Here is the first serious limitation of G.I. Joe: the excessive repetitiveness of gameplay which, except in rare cases not worth mentioning, withdraws into itself without knowing how to renew itself in the course of the various missions. Once you have chosen the two Joes to use, you start shooting and advance, leaving aside any minimum tactical pretensions, you go forward fearless, encouraged also by the average low level of the challenge offered by your opponents, while in the most difficult situations it is possible to resort to the overalls accelerator: a sort of temporary powerup, in which ours, in addition to becoming completely immune to blows, significantly increase their offensive potential. Under normal conditions, each Joe enjoys a standard attack diversified according to the characteristics of the soldier used and a special secondary blow that becomes available once the appropriate bar has been filled with downed enemies. Xbox 360 goals J.I. Joe is not particularly generous in giving points, moreover it must be considered that all the objectives refer only to player 1, in this way even by unlocking objectives in a cooperative session the beneficiary will be only the first player while the second will not no target will be notified, you are warned. Canyons in the desert The areas that host the various missions are divided into macro areas differentiated by the geography of the settings and we go from snow-capped mountains to deserts, tropical jungles or large underground bases and, if such diversification is appreciable, it is also sad to realize how this you do not bring a substantial heterogeneity in the game levels which all develop following an elementary canyon topography where the way forward is always the same interspersed with short backtracking sessions. It often happens that you find your way blocked by easily removable barriers by destroying special power plants, an expedient that is far too recycled by the developers during the adventure which gets tired quickly given the lack of other noteworthy level design ideas. During the firefights, the Joes have the possibility of taking cover behind special covers in a similar way to what the Gears of War characters do, however in this case the system for hooking up to cover is much less intuitive and functional than the efficiency enjoyed in the Epic title. Some missions also offer the possibility of using off-road vehicles or armored tanks, all adequately equipped to defeat opponents relying on a respectable firepower, at least until the destruction of the vehicle itself, these are governed by a rather approximate guidance system and they do not change much the nature of the gameplay which is consumed in the same way as in the footed sessions. Watch where you shoot! We talked about the gameplay of G:I. Joe as minimalist and intuitive, characteristics also enhanced by the presence of a pointing and target locking systemor automatic. If from one point of view this choice recalls a long shooter tradition, it should be noted that this system suffers from some defects such as lingering on secondary and non-hostile targets such as points containers, which forces you to manually scroll through the targets, a practice which in in the middle of the firefight can lead to a premature and frustrating game over. This solution, far from perfect, is combined with a fixed camera system that does not take into account the direction in which we are shooting, in doing so it is not uncommon to find ourselves raging on enemies we cannot see. unacceptable situation that does not allow you to have control of the action. Another heavily deficient aspect is the graphic one. G.I. Joe shows a technical level that is more at the levels of Live Arcade productions, rather than a game destined for store shelves. Polygonal mass and textures do not reach the standards to which the hardware of current consoles have accustomed us, while the game environments (linear and repetitive) do not offer any interaction with the actions of the characters on the screen. The general work betrays an unpleasant taste of low budget production. Comparison Of the possibilities offered by the Wiimote, the team did not make any specific use. By shaking the controller, in fact, you can perform melee shots, but it is better to use the directional cross, since in that way you can charge the attacks. Cross that also serves to switch between targets, as no use is made of the aiming capabilities of the Wiimote. In short, it is the same game as the other versions. Point hunting An appreciable aspect of this production is the underlying spirit that animates the game, that of the good old coin ops. At the end of each level there is in fact a count of points which is used to unlock certain rewards, in particular new Joes to use. During the missions, the aim, in addition to surviving, is to grind the greatest number of points, ringing multipliers and accessing secret areas that can be reached thanks to the peculiar skills of some characters. Especially if you play in the company of a friend, the race for the highest score gives satisfaction especially in the soul of those players who have always had a soft spot for this kind of healthy competition. To enhance this aspect there is also an indicator that indicates in percentage terms how much each of the two characters was more influential during the game, which loses its charm if you play alone forced to change character and entrust our companion to the care of the cpu (which makes the avatar impersonated by the computer virtually immortal, distorting the balance of the battle).", "date": "2009-08-11", "grade": "4.5"}
