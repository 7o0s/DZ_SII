Tennis Tennis is one of the best games in the package although it doesn't fully convince at first. Up to four players can play, and as many wiimotes are needed as there are participants. The game always takes place in doubles even when playing alone, in this case by mimicking the shot both Miis in your team (who move on the field automatically) try to hit the ball. As anticipated, the first impressions weren't great and the ball didn't seem to follow the player's intentions that much, giving the idea of going even at random. Over time it is possible to grasp certain details and to understand what the constraints of the software are, perhaps by choice or perhaps by limitations, and opinions begin to change. It should be noted that the shot does not only depend on ~how~ you hit, but also on ~when~ you hit: by anticipating the shot you will be able to make more angled balls, while by hitting the last one the ball will go straight. It's not easy to give a confident assessment of the quality of hit recognition, it's not like moving a stick and pressing ~A~, expecting all shots to succeed would be a bit like expecting it in a real situation, but not because WiiSports is a simulation accurate, but only because you don't have the certainty of having made the right movement at the right time, especially considering that there is no racket and no ball. The fact is that, once you become familiar with the game, the illusion of shooting live really exists. Furthermore, it is clear to see how the reactions change according to the player: there are those who never throw it in, there are those who make beautiful shots, and there are those who miss, demonstrating that the game does not cheat, it can be accurate, but not cheating. The advice we can give you is to position your virtual racket as your Mii is holding it, everything will seem more natural and likely. The effects to be imprinted with the wrist are also worth experimenting with. It goes without saying that the fun is directly proportional to the number of players on the fieldno, in the living room. Last note: don't be embarrassed, get up from the sofa, make sure there is nobody around you, as the message on the screen warns, and play tennis: have fun. Baseball Baseball is also a rather fun and successful game, and unlike tennis it catches right away despite some limitations and perhaps too many tricks in the launch phase. You need two Wiimotes to play for two. The launch phase is rather ~old-style~. If it is true that to throw the ball you have to give the pad a shake, to decide the type of shot you have to press the various buttons on the remote control. You can decide whether to shoot closer or further away (or high or low) than the hitter, whether to hit a fast ball, a spin ball or a curve ball, or what in the jargon is called a ~splitter~, or a bastard ball that softens and goes down near the beater, sending it empty. On the hitter's side, things get more interesting. Meanwhile, you can wield the wiimote like a club and see on screen how the Mii does exactly the same with his club. At the time of hitting the ball you will be in the field: if you consider that the pitch is not good, do nothing and you will get a penalty (~ball~) for the pitcher, otherwise try to hit. When the bat is successful, your men will start running around the bases automatically based on the time it takes the other team to recover the ball. After the joke the game is totally controlled, you just have to hope it was a good shot. While batting, you can also lower your bat to blunt the ball in order to try to surprise your opponent and gain a base. Although our thoughts go towards more complete simulations, we can only be satisfied and confident for the future, given that what we have in hand is only the starting point. Bowling There is little to say about Bowling, the programmers have revealed that there is no random element in the shot, and that if you were able to repeat the same shot twice, the ball in the game would move in the same way. You will see how each person wielding the Wiimote manages to shoot in very different ways, and that everyone will almost always shoot in his own way. By means of the arrows and the ~A~ key you can move the Mii and the aim left and right. The actual shot is carried out as follows: you have to raise the remote control in front of your chest as if it were a real ball (and the Mii will do the same on the screen), press and hold down the ~B~ trigger (and the Mii will start with the animation is absolutely automatic), the throwing movement is made and the key is released as if to release the ball. Then you can only wait for the outcome of the shot. Despite the soulaction of the Mii is automatic you can choose from which height to leave the ball based on when you release the key. Fun like bowling or boring like bowling, you decide. Golf Golf is as simple as it is unforgiving. On the map you will be able to see through a line of 4 segments the distance that your club can reach. On the screen there is an indicator divided into as many segments, and you just have to mimic the swing gesture to reach the desired power. You can try it as many times as you want and when you feel confident, hold down ~A~ and make the decisive shot, if it turned out well you're on horseback, otherwise you'll have to recover with the next shots. The direction can be set with the directional arrows and you must also take into account the strength and direction of the wind. On the green the sensitivity becomes more accentuated and you will have to start making more calibrated shots. In all, the game offers 9 holes, and no opponents in case you play alone. We only point out a certain insecurity of the software in case you are on the green and try to make very light strokes. It may happen that the club begins to move without apparent sense, without understanding whether you or the game are messing up. With Mario Golf and Tiger Woods (both not yet announced but discounted) we will really become golfers. Golf is as simple as it is unforgiving. Boxing Boxing is the most controversial game in the whole package. Let's start by saying that this is the only sport in the game that needs the nunchaku module to be connected to the wiimote (in any case included in the Wii package). Both sensors seem to be exploited in a rather artificial way. While it is true that moving your guard up and down your Mii does the same, the same cannot be said for the shots you try to give. For forehands there are no problems, but for hooks and kidney shots you need to experiment a bit and they are not always recognized. The blows and animations obviously take their time to complete and therefore instead of waving at random (which in any case leads to something) it would be more correct to try to understand when to enter with gestures and when to wait for the Mii to return to defense. The defense is maintained by holding the two controls in front of the face, and leaning with the torso to the right and left, your character will do the same, leaving you with a certain amazement. On paper it looked pretty fun, but in truth it turned out to be the least successful game of the compilation. WiiSport: How old is your body? Among the various game modes is the training mode and physical test. The training mode teaches you to play better in each sport, offering you 3 different types of challenges for each game, for a total of 15. We point out the one in tennis where you have to hit a target that appears on a wall that crumbles as it is hit, and that of boxing where you have to dodge the balls that our coach throws at us like Bud Spencer (or was it Gegia?) on the film Bomber. At the end of the workout, your abs will hurt. In general, these ~games within the game~ are very useful for fully learning the controls of each sport and their nuances. The physical test mode sees you engaged in 3 tests chosen from the five sports, and at the end of these the software will assign an evaluation based on the results obtained. As with Brain Training on DS you can take the test once a day. Mii, Wii and Sports Another perhaps little-known feature of WiiSports is the game's full integration with Mii characters and the Wii Message Board. When playing or training, you can choose a Mii. If you do this he will become your character, gain experience in each sport and earn medals in training. There is no limit to the Miis that you can use by making the whole family or friends play. If you want someone to play without assigning them a Mii, you can invite them in as a guest, and if they're a ~Mii-wielding~ friend, you can draw the character from their wiimote (which they've brought from home). Messages on the bulletin board will mark some particular events, such as registering a new Mii or achieving some particular objectives. Messages will have the face of the Mii they refer to stamped on the envelope. This integration between game and bulletin board is a rather interesting and apt idea and I would like to see it applied in the future in other games, even if the suspicion that it will be a function that Nintendo will mainly use is more than legitimate. Comment The WiiSports games were presented as technical demos at E3 2006 and were born as experiments by programmers on the capabilities of the Wiimote. After a certain consensus received at the fair, it has become the product we have in our hands. The fact that it includes in bundle allows us to turn a blind eye to some limitations that undermine its replayability and depth (any tournament and opponents in golf are missing, for example). Although already in the first round of tests you will understand what the game has (and doesn't have) to offer you, you will surprisingly find yourself replaying it more than you expected from a first test. The important thing is that Wii Sport manages to entertain, this time even in the company of those who perhaps have never wanted to know about video games. The training and physical test modes are more of a last minute addition and will manage to engage you in different tests which will also improve your perception of sports. And finally, let's face it, hitting a home run when Kutaragi's Mii is at the throw is priceless. Pros Bundled with the console Fun and accessible to all Finally experimenting with the Wiimote Cons Some games too simplified No tournaments or incentives to play alone We begin to write this article not without some embarrassment and some uncertainty, and the reasons are many: we find ourselves judging what is a ~given~ game to us, which is controlled in a way we are not used to, and which has no precedents in the history of video games if not in those consoles to be connected to the TV sponsored by the Mustache of the moment. It's not easy to give a focused cut to the review, ideas overlap, meet and collide and ratings on sports change as you continue to play. After many hours spent on the title, the only certainty we can give is that, leaving aside legitimate doubts and expectations, WiiSports is fun. Trying to rearrange ideas let's start from a fact: WiiSports is necessary. Fortunately here (and in the USA) Nintendo had the idea of including this collection of sports ~mini-simulations~ bundled with the console, giving us the opportunity to immediately experience the functions of the new Wii controller. We agree that Zelda is a great game and that every Wii or GC owner absolutely shouldn't, indeed shouldn't, miss it, but it's also true that having a Wii only with Zelda would be like buying a car with an automatic transmission and keep shifting to manual. As you know WiiSports includes 5 disciplines in one disc and in order as in the menu they are: Tennis, Baseball, Bowling, Golf and Boxing, and, to find an order also in the article, we will describe them in the same sequence.", "date": "2006-12-18", "grade": null}
