The work was also supported by the Nordic Game Program, an initiative that allows Scandinavian studios to receive certifications regarding the compatibility of their products with younger users. The project started from the desire to create a point and click adventure in which the fulcrum was not based on the solution of environmental puzzles, but rather on the creation of opportunities, through the knowledge of other characters, the participation in common experiences and the learning activities in the absence of prompts. During the interviews that Svedang has given in recent years, the desire to start from an idea that could not be rigidly classified according to traditional genres, but which at the same time traced many of those activities performed by all of us in the course of daily life, transpired. By his own admission the game he envisioned should have been a kind of Grand Theft Auto without the burden of gratuitous violence, car chases and explosions. On closer inspection it must have been above all a provocation, or at least it is the opinion that we have after spending several hours in the company of this bizarre and truly unique graphic adventure. In Else Heart.Break() the aim given to the player is to modify the surrounding reality and to do so above all through computers. To achieve the goal it will therefore be necessary to master the code present inside the terminals, going to dissect an alternative reality in which the bits have even replaced the atoms. Assuming that many players would not have possessed sufficient knowledge of source code to be able to orient themselves without a minimum of construct, throughout the story both the characters and the events will serve as a vehicle for understanding the situations, although the perspective for the performance of any activity that is implicit and never induced or guided in any way. Else Heart.Break() is a gaming universe in which hacking plays a central role Waiting, discovery and... patience Sebastian is still living at his parents' house when he receives the phone call that will change his future, for better or for worse. A representative of Wellspring, a soda can manufacturing company in the distant city of Dorisburg, seems interested in offering the boy the prospect of a job and asks him to show up on site so that he can start the business as soon as possible. A few moments later the introductory screen places us in front of a stylized passenger ship that is preparing to dock in the port of the town. Checking into the Devotchka hotel is only the first step towards discovering a new world: new acquaintances will turn into friendships, while behind the tendentious tranquility that populates the streets lie the plots of activists and hackers, fighting in confrontations with mysterious forces that control the city in complete secrecy. Just when he is trying to figure out where to find the man who promised him a job, Sebastian will meet Pixie. At first, the girl will limit herself to meeting him at some parties and events, before introducing him to the basics of hacking. The code that is used to control the terminals and modify the surrounding environment is based on the BASIC language, but obviously no specific knowledge is needed to understand how to interact with these mechanisms. Gradually the changes that can be made will become more and more varied and more and more complex interaction possibilities will open up. Obviously, to maintain the coherence of the game, Svedang had to carry out some balancing work and restrict the number of interventions that players can perform, above all safeguarding the main buildings and objects. The Else Heart.Break() problem, however, is mainly linked to the first part of the experience and to the constant feeling of detachment, due to the lack of synthesis about the tasks that can be performed. In the game, no trace of the information collected during the dialogues is kept, unless you decide to take notes separately, so as to avoid losing details or perhaps having to remember what to do after a few days off from playing. The city of Dorisburg was represented as a microcosm with its own rules; the map is entirely explorable but the places are notaccessible can be unlocked only after receiving the rudiments of hacking. The alternation of the day and night cycle marks the appointments and habits of the citizens, the characters that Sebastian meets live their lives and will continue to have personalized rhythms, without ever appearing static. After all, this is the main source of attraction of the game: a city that lives according to rules, to which the protagonist - as well as the player - must strictly comply. The people with whom it is possible to interact can be available at certain hours of the day and night, it is possible to obtain access to particular events or structures, to request useful information to understand in which direction to go or where to go to look for what is necessary for the continuation of the missions. Conversations are managed through multiple choice dialogues, many of which prove to be crucial for understanding how to proceed. Moreover, with the exception of Sebastian's bag, which serves as an inventory for collecting objects, there are no other menus that come to the player's rescue. Even the map, although present, indicates in a summary way only the main places of interest, without offering references either on the current position of the player or on the direction to be taken. There is a story as a leitmotif, but the game above all induces to explore, to understand what is happening in the city, to learn more about the people who live there and to get to know new realities or places of interest, so as to always add more pieces to your puzzle. At the same time there are frequent downtimes, a non-linearity that could be indigestible to those who don't have patience and don't want to get in tune with the staid rhythm that especially marks the early stages of the game. The sense of bewilderment could therefore make its way very soon and lead most to abandon any attempt to continue, even before seeing what the title has in store for them ahead. The flow of time according to these criteria is a specific design choice: it often happens that you have to meet people or do things at certain times, without having the real opportunity to speed up operations. The only solution is to try to sleep, but even this hypothesis can only be exploited at the correct times; alternatively you find yourself wandering around the city aimlessly, hoping to come across something unexpectedly useful, or vaguely amusing. This desire is often frustrated and the countless loading breaks between one area and another of the map, between the exterior and interior of the buildings and even between the different rooms contribute to further breaking up the gameplay. We then noticed some problems with the functioning of the cameras. Very often the fixed view becomes uncomfortable and places the shot in positions that are not at all conducive to exploration. The problem could be circumvented by rotating the view using the directional arrows, but even doing this you risk worsening the result instead of improving it, even more so if you are inside buildings. It often happens that segments of the scenario obstruct the view, or that the shot does not remain stationary in the position in which the player has decided to place it, or even that it begins to rotate during a dialogue, causing many annoyances while reading. During our game there were even some bugs, which sometimes affected the session and forced us to reload from the last useful save. In fact, we happened to get stuck inside some rooms without it being possible to interact with the door from which we entered, while in other cases Sebastian was literally stuck inside the scenario, going to penetrate some of the surrounding objects .", "date": "2015-10-06", "grade": "7.0"}
