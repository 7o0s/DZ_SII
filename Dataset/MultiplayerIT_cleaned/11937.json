{"name": "Diabolik: The Original Sin - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/diabolik-the-original-sin-recensione.html", "text": "Diabolik, together with Tex, is undoubtedly one of the longest-lived and most appreciated comic characters in our country. Born from an idea of the Giussani sisters, the series has been published regularly in Italy for almost 45 years (the first issue dates back to November 1, 1962) and has now been excellently converted into a video game by the very Italian Artematica of Riccardo Cangini, who in the years she made herself known with Druuna, Jonathan Danter and Martin Mystere: Operation Dorian Gray. Diabolik: The Original Sin offers the player the possibility of tackling situations like a classic point-and-click adventure or in action mode, with stealth sections and mini-games that will require timing and skill, depending on the case. In any case, both modes are playable entirely with the mouse. The game begins with Eva Kant (the protagonist's eternal girlfriend) mysteriously locked up in a cell. The woman will obviously try to free herself, introducing the player to the mechanics of the title. Diabolik will be blackmailed by the mysterious character who kidnapped Eva, forcing the thief to take possession of a work of art known as The Original Sin. Without saying anything about the story, let's just say that despite a slow start, this ends up captivating the player, pushing him to continue as only great adventures can do. Longevity and price The audio is also at good levels and although the reference characters are silent, the interpretation by the voice actors is excellent, as are the background music, quite varied and suitable for the context of the game. Some notes must be made for the record, for some typos in the subtitles and the fact that these sometimes do not appear completely on the screen. Speaking of longevity, the adventure mode can be completed in 10 hours, while another 10 are necessary for that action, since in any case after the first pass, certain sections will certainly be simpler. Unless you decide to start with the latter, Diabolik: The Original Sin offers about 20 hours of adventure and fun. If we add to this the excellent price at which the title is sold (20 euros) and the presence of a comic book to embellish the package, missing out on this game is truly a crime. System requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 1.2 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 256 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 with 32 MB Ram Disk Space: 2.5 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 2.4 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 1 GB Video Card: GeForce 4 with 64 MB of memory Disk Space: 2.5 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor 1.66 GHz RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: Geforce 7300 with 256 MB of memory Comment Diabolik: The Original Sin, proves to be far above expectations, thanks to a technical sector that does its job very well from all points of view and a game structure capable of making fans of the saga happy in one fell swoop comics and adventure fans. Do not underestimate the presence of two well-made modes, an above average longevity and an extremely competitive price. Pros Excellent longevity Excellent quality voice acting Functional cartoon graphics Very attractive price Cons Some frustrating situations It is not possible to skip the cutscenes Some imperfections in the texts Diabolik: The Original Sin is available for PC. Double adventure, double fun The adventure mode, as already mentioned, offers a classic scheme for this genre, with scenarios to examine and interact with with the left mouse button, often using the objects present in the inventory (accessible with the central button or with the ~Space ~). These include various ~tools of the trade~, such as diamond points for use on glass, masks, sleeping gases and so on. It must be said that in the initial stages some situations can put the player in difficulty due to the need for the protagonist to leave a safe road behind. However, once you understand this aspect, it will be easier to continue the story. By choosing to play Diabolik in action mode, a whole series of situations and mini-games will be introduced whose failure will lead to the inevitable game over. The advice in these cases is to save often, in order not to find yourself starting a chapter over again, given that among other things, it will not be possible to skip the numerous videos. Although these are not technically advanced, they go very well with what is the trait and the atmosphere that permeates the Diabolik series. In fact, the presence of full colors and sharp contours, return what appears to all intents and purposes as a dand the best combinations of video games and comics. The same thing can be said about the in-game sections, with backgrounds and characters faithful to the series. Someone could also say (rightly, however) that the graphics are not exceptional, but it is also true that Diabolik comics have always been made with a stroke that is in some ways essential when compared to American or Japanese productions. We therefore do not feel the need to dispute this aspect, considering it marginal.", "date": "2007-10-15", "grade": null}
