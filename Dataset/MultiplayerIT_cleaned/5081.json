Resident Evil 7 brings it back on track by forcing us to approach each obstacle with the angst expected in a survival horror and not with the momentum of a first person shooter. However, things are quite different, starting from the creatures that we find ourselves facing to get to the change of camera that switches from the third to the first person also as a function of a virtual reality that is finally fully exploited. In short, we are faced with a title inevitably indebted to those who in recent years have continued to hit the purest key of terror, although Resident Evil goes far beyond the jumps on the chair, the gruesome details and the perennial escape of faced with a threat too great to deal with. Between puzzles, inventory and shortcuts, the origins of the series are all felt and on the plate there are also the strength of an iconic brand, despite the obvious narrative detachment, and of a software house like Capcom which, despite stumbling quite often, can boast experience and resources in quantity. Unfortunately these have not always been used in favor of the PC version, especially in a Japan which has snubbed Windows for a long time and which often still forces PC users to bear compromises bordering on the inexplicable. But in this case things seem to work quite well and there are no major shortcomings excluding the initial one of support for virtual reality, due to the temporal exclusivity for the PlayStation VR viewer. There is also the Xbox Play Anywhere function, exclusive to the Xbox Store version, which allows you to play with the same digital copy on both Xbox One and PC. Horror in high definition with the PC version of Resident Evil 7 A graphics engine worthy of a RE? The graphics engine of Resident Evil 7 is called RE Engine and was shown for the first time with the famous VR Kitchen demo, whose technologies ended up in the Beginning Hour and, of course, in the full game. Also developed with virtual reality in mind, it is an engine that follows an increasingly widespread philosophy, aiming to improve performance with complex lighting and allowing developers to view the result of their work in real time, retouching after retouching. This allows a development team to work with greater knowledge of the facts and the interiors of Resident Evil 7 show meticulous design work, albeit undermined by fluctuating technical quality. Some textures, to be honest, seem to emerge from a distant past and, when observed closely, cause a pinch of anguish that has little to do with the horror of the Baker house, but the overall yield is not affected too much. In most cases, it is the most successful details that emerge, such as the rays of light or Mia's face, and it is often thanks to the lighting of a title that does not aim to amaze us with hordes of zombies and infinite horizons, instead closing us in a claustrophobic mansion in whose dark bowels every light plays a leading role. With such a setting it is not surprising that the load is not gigantic, so much so that it runs on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 1080p at 60 images per second, net of some drops that do not affect the experience that much. To achieve the same fluidity on PC, at least according to the developers, you need a 3GB GTX 1060, even if someone has experienced some frame rate problems, presumably related to the amount of memory. In any case, such a card, in principle comparable to the RX 480 and slightly higher than the RX 470 but in the case of Resident Evil 7 less performing than both, gives us more defined, vibrant and engaging graphics, approachable only from PlayStation 4 Pro which can also boast 4K. It must be said that in general the gap with respect to the consoles is not striking, thanks to the setting of the technical sector, but the superior lighting has a weight on the overall performance and when it comes to video games the definition and the possibility of customizing the graphics have a important role. Specifically, the settings of Resident Evil 7 allow you to put your hand to various technical parameters and allow you to exploit the hardware to the bone. The frame rate can be unlocked and there is no lack of support for 144Hz which, in combination with a powerful card like our MSI 1080 Gaming X, offer an extremely fluid experience, at least in 1080p and 1440p. In 4K resolution also an engine like that of Resident Evil 7, marked by compromises butweighed down by high-level lighting, it tests the powerful NVIDIA card, even if there are some anomalies since according to the first benchmarks the Radeon R9 390X 8GB can boast similar performance. Precisely for this you assume the performance for NVIDIA cards will improve significantly. In any case, the title is already fully playable in Ultra HD thanks to a frame rate which, although fluctuating, travels quite stably between 50 and 60 frames per second in more complex environments, with some more generous peaks. Fluidity obviously grows in 1440p, reaching 80 frames per second with peaks of over 100, and literally takes off in 1080p, almost always remaining above the 144 frames that allow us to take advantage of a 144Hz monitor. We cannot therefore say that Resident Evil 7 lacks optimization, despite the dancer frame rate and the performance discrepancy that seems to reward some AMD cards. But the performances are on average good with most of the most recent medium/low-end cards, including those indicated in the minimum requirements, and that is enough for us. This, of course, net of the anomalies that we assume will soon be resolved or mitigated by a Capcom already active on the patch front. Graphic customization and controls The numerous graphic options include very interesting functions such as interlaced rendering, which allows you to considerably lighten the weight of the engine without compromising the glance too much, and resolution scaling which releases the rendering of the image from the native resolution. This means that, by raising or lowering the relative value from 0.5 to 2.0, it is possible to reproduce a 4K image even on a 1080p screen, with all the advantages, not extreme but not completely negligible, guaranteed by the use of a high-definition source repurposed to fit into a smaller space. In doing so, it must be taken into account that the workload is that of 4K, and this means that by pushing the selector to the maximum even a GTX 1080, at least with GeForce 378.49 drivers, has some problems in constantly maintaining 60 fps, but we bet in a short-term improvement in the performance of NVIDIA cards and there are several intermediate values that allow you to improve the quality without affecting performance too much. Also, depending on your need or taste, you can enable or disable lens flare, motion blur, bloom, reflections, subsurface scattering, dynamic shadows, depth of field and antialiasing which includes FXAA, TAA, FXAA+TAA and the less soft but lighter SMAA. The options are certainly not lacking and also include the possibility of selecting interlaced rendering, the quality of the textures, from low to very high, as well as the texture filtering whose settings, ranging from low to very high, correspond to the classic progression that ranges from 4x up to 16x. Like the dedicated texture filters, the level of detail is also hidden but it's there, built into the option to change the quality of the meshes, while there's no need to guess about ambient occlusion which includes SSAO , SSAO variable depending on the needs of the game and HBAO+. Finally, there are welcome extras that include the ability to cache static object shadows to take advantage of any four or more GB of video memory available, as well as chromatic aberration, which can be turned off, and two different color spaces. color. In short, everything necessary to calibrate load and graphics performance even if the requirements are not particularly low, demanding a GTX 760 or a Radeon R7 260X. If nothing else, the estimate should be honest and guarantee a good level experience, while support for DirectX 12 is missing, but given the results, we still congratulate Capcom while maintaining a cautious step in addressing another element that is often difficult for Japanese developers: controls on PC. Things are going well from this point of view too, even if the console layout, also evident in some icons such as that of the directional cross, is a bit cumbersome on PC. Deceived by the main menu, not the most functional, we finally found the mapping of the keys and we must recognize that Capcom has learned from the mistakes of the past, giving us back an intuitive and fully playable title even using the mouse and keyboard.", "date": "2017-01-24", "grade": "9.0"}
