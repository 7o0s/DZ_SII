{"name": "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/186933-hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-la-realta-della-propria-mente.html", "text": "The path taken by Ninja Theory is interesting, because although not dotted with titles universally recognized as masterpieces, it has helped to create a certain aura of charisma around the British developer, above all for his skill from an artistic point of view: on consoles there we left with a reboot of Devil May Cry which caused a lot of discussion for the graphics and gameplay cut, but which undoubtedly was endowed with personality. Many, perhaps, expected a natural evolution towards unpublished intellectual properties devoted to the action genre, but the Cambridge guys had different plans: content development team - about 20 people - title published without external funding, sale price halved compared to the classics triple A, but guaranteeing a few hours of play of the same value. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a surprising title if it is approached with the above expectations, as it places the gameplay at the service of a theme rarely treated so completely within video games, that of psychosis. Precisely for this reason, we immediately dissolve a couple of curiosities which in the case of this title become secondary: as anticipated, it costs 30 euros and we completed it in about 8 hours. In the next paragraph, therefore, we will focus on the aspects that led to our judgment, which should be taken into consideration, for better or for worse, by those interested in the game. Playstation 4 trophies Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is one of those titles that falls into the ~very easy~ category with regards to obtaining the coveted platinum. By completing the game we have in fact unlocked 90% of the overall trophies, evidently leaving only a handful of inscriptions on the street that tell stories related to Nordic mythology. The rest is obtained by naturally continuing the adventure and winning a good amount of battles. The torments of the mind Psychosis is a mental disorder little known by most, which has no particular physical manifestations compared to other diseases and is therefore difficult to understand by those who are not affected by it. Usually the symptoms are hallucinations and delirium, with the impossibility of discerning what is happening in one's mind from objective reality, with respect to which contact is lost. Be careful not to confuse it with psychopathy, which adds a lack of empathy and remorse, but also be careful to approach it lightly, we will limit ourselves to doing so in relation to this game: it is a delicate issue, regarding which the developers of Ninja Theory have turned to study groups and scientists in order to learn it fully and reproduce it in the video game in a credible and above all honest way. In the form of an adventure into the world created by the mind of Senua, a Celtic warrior who has suffered a series of traumas since she was a child: the father who isolated her at the first signs of imbalance, the violent death of her loved one, the beliefs of Norse mythology in which the leaders of subjugated tribes were sacrificed as gifts to the gods. A constant struggle with the inner darkness that can only exist if light is present: the bigger the shadow cast, the greater the danger. We don't want to reveal further aspects of the ~plot~ to you because it is right that the player experiences it in the first person; what we can tell you, however, is how Senua's torments have been reproduced from an aesthetic and gameplay point of view. Let's start from the latter, set in third person with a close-up view shifted to the right; like Resident Evil 4 and the new God of War, so to speak. The progression is completely linear except for a couple of moments that can be tackled in reverse order, based on a series of fights - which represent 20-30% of the experience apart from the final part - and puzzle solving environmental, always with a high symbolic value integrated with the narration. Often you come across barred doors with some runic symbols depicted on them, which are to be found by exploring the setting perhaps from specific angles. In other moments the protagonist faces the illusions generated by her own mind, and then she has to find her way by looking through ~portals~ that reveal passages. And again, reliving the fire of your own village, with the flames representing the danger to be overwhelmed. In these situations it is a question of solving basically simple puzzles, exploring environments that are fairly large in size but linear in articulation, using R2 (on PlayStation 4, the title is console exclusive but also available on PC) to reveal the next step. The system of coBeating is associated with Senua's will to defeat her own fears, which manifest themselves in dark creatures with disturbed aspects; usually the clashes take place one on one, but you have to be careful of the attacks coming from the other monsters on the battlefield. The scheme of the commands foresees the parry with R1, the dodge with X, light and heavy attacks with square and triangle; finally the circle to give a kick in order to break the defenses of the opponents equipped with a shield. Everything is quite simplistic following the classic script in which timing and counterattack at the right time count, with a small sample of moves available. A last possibility is given by throwing a beam of light capable of slowing down time, available following a certain number of avoided or successful blows. In this regard, the level of difficulty can be chosen at any time - without affecting the achievement of trophies - with the new ~Auto~ option which is calibrated according to one's performance and the number of hits suffered: in any case, we suggest play Hard right now, in order to obtain a satisfactory level of challenge. There is no darkness without light That's all, neither the general gameplay nor the combat system can be compared to the best expressions present in adventure or action titles, but what struck us is how they have been integrated into the narrative and visual reproduction of the world created by Senua, that is in a masterful way. This is thanks to a double work done by Ninja Theory, who created a small jewel from an audiovisual point of view with Hellblade. If possible, arm yourself with good headphones or a positional stereo system, because the whole adventure is accompanied by exceptional dubbing - in English - and by the many voices inside the protagonist's head, which come from very specific directions and contribute to increasing overall involvement. Too bad for the lazy work done on the Italian subtitles, which often offer entire lines of characters anticipating dialogues which are instead recited with pauses and emphasis: they deserve better synchronization with the written text. In any case, the acting of the protagonist, the sampling of the voices, the quality of the dialogues are really of excellent workmanship; often the clashes and topical moments are accompanied by screams and conversations capable of increasing empathy with the protagonist, effectively elevating something that taken alone and grafted into a ~normal~ game would have been bordering on banal. The same exceptional quality can be seen in purely artistic and visual terms: Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice uses the Unreal Engine 4 graphics engine, modeled by Ninja Theory to offer a peculiar style that surprises in the range of colors and in the different filters applied depending on the situation. Among other things effects such as deformations, superimposition of writings, flashbacks have been reproduced following the testimonies of the patients and doctors consulted, in the same way symbols such as crows, branches and light, all the more intense as the shadows that are projected. In short, Hellblade denotes a certain visual research that translates very well even if it is analyzed from a purely graphic point of view, it is no coincidence that we have used the photographic mode to immortalize the numerous worthy glimpses that we have crossed. Some additional technical notes, on PlayStation 4 Pro the title offers the choice between 60hz and 30hz among the options, in this second case there is an increased resolution, equal to 1440p ~upscaled~ to 4K. HDR support will arrive later, we have preferred the greater fluidity, for a more satisfying response to the commands even if with some drops well masked by motion blur and aggressive graphic filters. In Hellblade there are decidedly exciting moments, others of extreme tension almost horror-like, capable of making the disturbances of the main protagonist live in a participatory way. When overwhelmed you don't die, you simply relive the same moment while the rot further corrodes Senua's mind, until you reach the final bars which partly explain better the process that took place in her head, partly help to understand how it is possible to have such a different perception from the one objectively (?) recognized.", "date": "2017-08-08", "grade": "8.8"}
