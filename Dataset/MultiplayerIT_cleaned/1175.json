The graphics of the game proves to be more than decent. The areas in which the various disciplines are addressed are well done and faithfully recreate the original counterparts. Unfortunately, the audience always proves to be made from cardboard templates (but still done better than other titles), except for some cases such as the race judges or athletes who train during your rehearsals. However, everything has a ~fake~ look, with textures that use a color palette that is too highlighted compared to reality. The faces of the sportsmen are well made, offering different series of expressions depending on the situation (nice faces full of anger or satisfaction at the end of each race), even if we have the same person for most of the disciplines (man or woman) not even there was a single pair of athletes for each nationality! These then all prove to be affected by a strange skin disease that covers her with freckles and enormous veins! Overall, everything is left to look at but more could have been given in terms of texture. three! Two! One! start! The audio sector proves to be adequate and well made: in addition to the captivating Olympic music that immerses us in the atmosphere of the competitions, we find the voices of the announcers and reporters (the former in English, the latter in Italian) who comment on the events and the public , ready to applaud us enthusiastically if we get good results or to remain in embarrassing silence in case of bad performances (complete with criticism from the speaker). The ambient noises are all there, and it seems to hear the show live. It is possible to use multi-speaker systems, thus recreating a stadium atmosphere! Select your country Strangely the game's multiplayer limits the number of participants to two. These can play simultaneously in certain tests (such as running) and take turns in others (weights and aiming above all) but in any case there is no possibility of introducing other players, unlike the titles of the past where multiplayer was encouraged. If twenty years ago interaction was limited, in 2004 we would have expected something new. Select your country Too bad because competing against the computer is extremely frustrating: after whole minutes spent pressing the buttons like crazy you will see it darting in front of you and this prevents you from carrying out group challenges that would have made the races more interesting and balanced (you will hate the AI of the game because he wins too much!). The bitter legacy... We have found more or less successful Olympic simulations since the days of the Atari 2600 but what unites these titles is the control system, annoying as never before. If twenty years ago the interaction was limited (and therefore we could still be satisfied) in 2004 we would have expected something new. Of course it is no longer a question of fiddling with joysticks but buttons but the result does not change. It was appropriate that at Eidos they experimented with something new. Athens is none other than the legendary 1984 Olympics Games adapted to the present day with a few more disciplines. Comment Athens 2004 brings this summer's Olympics to our PCs, in a decent package but featuring a gameplay that hasn't changed one iota in this type of game in twenty years: press the buttons as fast as you can (in this case you have to crush even two with alternation!), take aim trying to be precise. Stop. Certainly the graphics and sound contribute not a little to recreating the right Olympic atmosphere but the innovations are practically nil. The fact of having introduced a second button to be pressed immediately after the first aggravates things by increasing the sense of frustration in case of out of sync (and therefore poor performance in competitions). The multiplayer limited to two people strangely is only ideal if you're with a friend. Recommended for lovers of Olympic competitions and for those who enjoy smashing buttons without racking their brains. The others can override. Pros: It's always exciting to relive the Olympics Nostalgics of Atari and old coin-ops will enjoy Cons: No real multiplayer Outdated gameplay MOMENTS OF GLORY Athens 2004 is part of a series of particular titles which for years has been the cross and delight of those who love these world competitions. Unfortunately, the control system is the bitter evolution of the times gone by, when on the Commodore 64 the joysticks had to be shaken violently to increase the performance of the athletes. This heavy legacy here evolves even worse, with the introduction of two (!) buttons to be pressed alternately as fast as possible. The game simulates a whole series of events with fidelity of detail and succeeds in replicating what we see on TV on our modelsnitor. The initial menu offers us whether to use the arcade mode by choosing random tests or whether to launch into the Olympic simulation, complete with existing rules and records. This plans to tackle about twenty events in series or just a few offering competitions such as the Decathlon or athletics. The disciplines in which we will be able to try our hand are the classics that have been seen in these titles for years: 100/200/etc. meters, swimming (divided into four styles), archery or clay pigeon shooting, weights, pole vault (or high) etc. Unfortunately there are no other sports (simulating all of them would have been impossible) but perhaps something more could have been added.", "date": "2004-10-19", "grade": null}
