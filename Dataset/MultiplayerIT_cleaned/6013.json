It's the end of the immodest dream. All I have left is the other side, and not even the medal. I'm not full of life or glory. Oh, the glory... what a deception!~ We chose the words of Mizar, knight of Asgard, because they seemed to us the most appropriate to express our state of mind once the story mode of Saint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul is completed, ~sequel~ to that Brave Soldiers who, already a year ago, he had left us lukewarm to say the least despite our affection for the legendary Knights of the Zodiac. Known as Saint Seiya, the series created by Masami Kurumada is probably one of the manga and cartoons that most influenced today's thirty-year-olds, who grew up on bread, Nutella and Lightning from Pegasus between the 80s and the '80s 90. Even if in Japan no one has ever forgotten the deeds of Athena's noble Saints - and how could they, with Bandai hammering them with models and gadgets every month? - for some years the series has been experiencing a second youth thanks to the manga Next Dimension, the horrid film in computer graphics and the sequel all focused on the Golden Knights, Soul of Gold: it is no coincidence that Soldiers' Soul is out along with the latest installment of Soul of Gold, nor that the subs look alike or that developer Dimps has implemented divine gold armors in the new roster. Nor is it a coincidence that Soldiers' Soul is just a bit better than Brave Soldiers, even if it's still not enough. The Cosmo of the Knights burns a little more in Saint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul, but we're not there yet... My Asgard If you don't know The Knights of the Zodiac, because perhaps you have never seen an episode of the cartoon or read a booklet of the original manga or its spin-offs, Bandai Namco has also thought of you this time, and instead of spreading a bignami of the story through tons of text between one battle and another, as happened in Brave Soldiers, he commissioned Dimps to create short non-interactive interludes with the game's graphics engine that adapt the salient moments of the original series: these cutscenes, completely dubbed in Japanese and subtitled in Italian, they effectively connect the various clashes and narrate the story without risking putting anyone to sleep, but they fail in the slightest to outline the often complex, profound and tormented personalities of the various protagonists and, above all, of their opponents. The most sacrificed, needless to say, are the God Warriors of Asgard, the knights of Odin that our Japanese friends never went down with - despite being the coolest of all, and this is unquestionable! - only because that lazy Kurumada himself hadn't invented them. Specially conceived for the animated series, and forcedly wedged between the chapter of the Sanctuary and that of Poseidon, the Asgard saga returns to the fore in Soldiers' Soul in not too suspicious times, given that by chance also the recent cartoon miniseries Soul of Gold is set in the same frozen wastes. This means that we will be able to fight against and in the role of the knights of Odin: they are all there, including Alcor who is not a simple ~alternative costume~ of Mizar, and for the final boss there is also a very fierce Hilda of Polaris; of course, Seiya / Pegasus with the armor of Odin stops being a DLC character and enters the roster by force, already playable in the last mission of the Asgard campaign. The other three sagas - the Sanctuary, Poseidon and Hades - have remained those already played in Brave Soldiers, albeit with some small differences. Last year we complained that Dimps, in an attempt to remain faithful to the original series, had proposed too many encounters with the same enemies: the same happens in Soldiers' Soul, but the solution was a bit limited, even if not always wisely. If in the chapter of Asgard it is necessary to face Megrez with something like three different saints, we tried to understand why, subsequently, the only knight to face Hypnos, Thanathos and Hades in the Elysian Fields is only Seiya, also considering that the first of the two gods his bronze companions faced him wearing their divine armor. Fan discussions aside, the new Story mode is certainly more enjoyable than the previous one, and by defeating the various opponents - perhaps even satisfying the optional requirements requested at the beginning of each match - a flood of goodies is unlocked, including new wrestlers or costumes from select, battle cries and material to collect in the appropriate virtual album, such as illustrations, music tracks and so on. It is worth noting that purists may turn up their noses: the Italian localization is donequite well, but it's a hodgepodge of original names and historical Italian adaptations that definitely takes neither side, but all in all it plays on the nostalgia factor. The chapter inspired by Soul of Gold, on the other hand, left us rather dumbfounded: it is a separate mode, entitled Battaglia d'Oro, which has little or nothing to do with the animated miniseries that inspired it. In this mode, in fact, it is possible to face some duels using the twelve golden knights and their brand new divine armor: while in the homonymous series the saints of Athena faced the new God Warriors of Asgard, in the Golden Battle the various matches are simple ~what if~s introduced by very short narrative sequences that justify them in a quite ridiculous way. The Gemini knight, for example, challenges Ikki of the Phoenix because, demonstrating that he has purified his heart, he wants to find out which technique is more powerful between his Genro Mao Ken and the evil ghost of the good Phoenix. They are demented gimmicks that play a lot on the fanservice, and suggest that the developer was practically forced to add them at the last moment only to implement the golden knights with divine armor on the roster. The problem with the Golden Battle, however, is not this, but the fact that each match costs a torch, and that these must be bought with the hard-earned money fighting in the other modes. Which brings us straight to another Soldiers' Soul problem. Playstation 4 trophies 41 bronze, 5 silver, 3 gold and 1 divin--- um, platinum trophies for this outing in the universe of Masami Kurumada. Obviously you will need to unlock everything and more to get most of the trophies, as well as meet the special requirements in the story mode battles and perform certain actions both offline and online. Galaxian Clone War From the previous Brave Soldiers, Soldiers' Soul inherits the roster full of clones, but this time the selection screen is a little less embarrassing thanks to the addition of the knights of Asgard who, being nine, occupy a good part of the grid and the they swell a bit. Of course, the second row is occupied only by the golden knights (twelve, of course, but for each of them there is the version with the divine armor and Saga di Gemini also counts its ghostly manifestation) and in any case four versions for each must be tolerated of the five protagonists of the Bronze Horsemen, but it is a generous roster that covers a large part of the series, ensuring fans can find the knight - or costume - that they value most. The problem, if anything, is another. Dimps has done a decent balancing act on the animations, special moves and Bing Bang attacks of the various fighters, as in Brave Soldiers there were some sensationally stronger than others. After all, the difference between the characters is marginal: each saint has a handful of combos and attack techniques that are performed in the same way and change only in animation and effectiveness, as well as two special moves that they perform by pressing the strong attack or weak attack together with a shoulder. It's rare that the special moves change for the same character just because he's wearing a different armor, but in some cases this happens too and the Seiya wearing the Pegasus armor is slightly different from the one wearing the Sagittarius armor. This time, however, it is the Big Bang attacks that risk determining - indeed, limiting - the choice of character: the developer has modified the mechanics so that they no longer consume the Cosmos bar but that of the Seventh Sense, in order to prevent players from abusing them and charging the Cosmo mid-fight just to hurl them. A year ago, we criticized its usefulness, given that most Big Bang attacks triggered a very slow and predictable lock animation; however, this time around stronger characters - such as almost anyone wearing divine armor or the deities themselves - can unleash Big Bang attacks much more quickly. It follows that you will hardly play Pegasus in his first bronze armor, once the divine armor or that of Odin has been unlocked, because the variants are simply much more powerful and versatile. The same goes for all golden knights with divine armor, for example, or for some characters belonging to other castes. On the one hand, therefore, the raw performances of the fighters were balanced, while on the other, too much weight was involuntarily given to the ~super move~ of the moment. This is an issue that players can loosely circumvent by equipping battle cries, basicallyThere are bonuses to parameters such as total health or Cosmo regeneration speed that allow for a limited level of customization but which also need to be unlocked and then purchased. Fortunately, or unfortunately, unlocking the various characters is not exactly a walk. Completing the campaign or other modes already played in Brave Soldiers only unlocks the opportunity to buy the new heroes or their costumes in a kind of virtual shop in the collectibles screen, but the cost of some of them is exorbitant: to make an example, completing the entire saga of Hades we ended up with about 12,000 gold coins, but a bronze knight with divine armor costs a good 50,000! Which means that between the additional saints, the torches to progress in the Golden Battle, the battle cries and all the other collectibles, you will have to spend an impressive amount of hours loading the Cosmo and beating the computer or other players, online and offline, just to scrape together the money needed to complete the roster. Tag simulator The Japanese developer has faithfully reproduced the characters of Masami Kurumada this time too: cel shading was the obvious choice already a year ago with Brave Soldiers, but in the PlayStation 4 version of Soldiers' Soul we tested a good anti-aliasing which makes the image much cleaner and much more faithful to the cartoon, while renouncing the soft lines of the anime. On the other hand, Dimps has peppered this iteration with some nice thinking: the filter that blurs the cutscenes of the Big Bang attacks, for example, but also the gigantic onomatopoeias that stamp the final blows when the fight is concluded with a fiery attack or a special move, replicating historical poses and cartoons from the manga. Between these goodies and the spectacularity of the new Big Bang attacks, especially as regards the devastating golden knights with divine armor, the fanservice is guaranteed, but after a few hours and having seen a bit of everything, we find ourselves with a truly mediocre that gets pretty much all the basics of the genre wrong. Like Brave Soldiers, Soldiers' Soul is also a one-on-one adaptation of the musou The Battle of the Sanctuary released a few years ago on PlayStation 3: the player is free to move 360 degrees around the arena and jump by pressing a button, but the the camera struggles to follow him, often choosing the most abstruse shots to film the action and preventing the precise evaluation of the distances and position of the two wrestlers. It follows that often the combos go entirely empty, and what is worse is that their animations, however fluid and spectacular, are very long and too elaborate, leaving the knight who missed the first blow for the entire sequence uncovered . Once the gauge of the same name is charged and the Seventh Sense awakened, it is possible to interrupt any combo to connect the last attack to a special technique or a dashing attack, but this is a dynamic that rarely occurs during a match: for the most part of time you end up chasing each other in an attempt to find a glimmer, a breach in the opponent's defenses and animations that allows you to attack him. Insane, however, that the difference in the size of some characters implies that some attacks fail because the animations do not ~hook~ them, and that no special attack hits opponents on the mat. The special techniques and impetuous attacks, then, consume an indicator of the Cosmos which is recharged manually or by ringing the combos, but you must also draw on the Cosmos to perform evasive maneuvers which, this time, consume more and more with each use: while in Brave Soldiers the best players could dodge each other by ~teleporting~ behind the opponent, in Soldiers' Soul you can dodge much less since the consumption of the Cosmos soon becomes prohibitive. As a result, you end up using it only to attack ranged with the most effective special moves, and again it depends on the knight selected, since saints without ranged attacks are automatically disadvantaged. Here, despite all the balances and changes made to the gameplay, we return to the embarrassing skits of a year ago, where the heroic golden knights chase each other at sunset to stop just for a moment to recharge the Cosmo or launch an attack special that maybe will fail only because the animation is too slow and the opponent simply continued to run without even realizing that the danger escaped.", "date": "2015-09-28", "grade": "6.5"}
