{"name": "Tannenberg", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tannenberg-recensione.html", "text": "Tannenberg is not only the ideal sequel to Verdun. In a certain sense it is its complement, of which it shares not only the same setting, the First World War, but above all the underlying philosophy. Verdun certainly cannot be defined as an immense success by itself, but nevertheless it has managed to gather around it a stable and passionate community, looking for a more technical gameplay than the average commercial online shooter. Tannenberg not only follows in its wake, but joins it completely, addressing exactly the same audience, so much so that the game launcher is practically shared. Gameplay and modes As the title suggests, Tannenberg is set on the Eastern European front of the First World War. Since the first game, those who have played Verdun will find themselves at home, despite the changes in the layout of the maps, which are much larger (at least in the Maneuver mode, the only really playable one after all): the pace of the game is not very fast, the weapons are reproduced in a realistic way and ambushes are favored over direct clashes. In short, the mechanics require you to be patient and act sensibly, coordinating with the other team members, at least ideally, also because the time to kill is very low and the space for reckless maneuvers is practically zero. The gameplay consists of an alternation of movements, strictly on foot, and stalking, where the key is to be able to surprise the opponents trying not to be discovered. In our experience, most of the time we die because of someone who managed to get around us. Often you can't even figure out where the lethal blow comes from. The key to doing better is being able to communicate with the rest of the team to give each other directions, but that's not always possible. Tannenberg offers a total of three modes, but you end up playing only one, the aforementioned Maneuver, in which you have to advance to conquer territories (capture points) from the rival army. Each zone captured reduces the resources available to the rival army and increases ours; to win you must exhaust your opponent's resources or conquer his headquarters. As we mentioned, in theory there are two other modes: Attrition, which is the team deathmatch, and Rifle Deathmatch, which is a normal deathmatch. Too bad the servers of both are practically empty and playing them is a superior company to winning a game at Maneuver. These are certainly not the best ways to exploit Tannenberg's mechanics, but in fact one wonders why they were included, their appeal is so low. No players no parties Unfortunately Tannenberg has a big problem, which cannot be attributed to the developers but which must inevitably be taken into consideration, because it ends up ruining most of the games: at the time of writing this review, the game servers were occupied by a few dozen people . Considering that the games are played between sixty-four players, the result is that you often end up facing more bots than humans, especially if you don't want to play only the most popular maps. The bots aren't terribly behaving, but in general they're uncoordinated, slow to react, and aren't a big deal when engaging. In short, inevitably their quantity ends up unbalancing the matches: the team with the most bots loses, unless there is some phenomenon on the other side. Here another small problem emerges: Tannenberg was designed for Verdun players, i.e. for people extremely dedicated to this type of gameplay, who were practically at home when they started Tannenberg. The lack of fresh players makes access for newbies really difficult, although the community is quite available and in our experience the unpleasant phenomena that are now the rule in the most famous online shooters (cheaters, free offenses and so on) have never occurred ). In short, if Tannenberg intrigues you, our advice is to follow its forums and get in touch with other players, making you like the most played maps, the only ones that guarantee decent games.", "date": "2019-03-25", "grade": "6.5"}
