{"name": "Disgaea 5 Complete", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183217-disgaea-5-complete-la-follia-completa.html", "text": "Disgaea 5 Complete is the first title from Nippon Ichi to come out for Switch and the choice could not have been wiser as it is also the best game set in the bizarre multiverse formed by the Japanese developer's strategic RPGs. The first Disgaea dates back as far as 2003 and PlayStation 2: even if not much has changed in terms of gameplay in these fourteen years, Nippon Ichi has constantly refined his experience in the various sequels and spin-offs. The appointment with the Netherworld has now become inevitable, however Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance - this is the original title - was released a couple of years ago for PlayStation 4, receiving enormous acclaim but selling relatively little. Maybe that's why Atlus decided to bring Disgaea 5 back to the new Nintendo console, including all the DLC released at the time: will it have aged well enough to be worth a look even if it's just a conversion? Atlus brings all the madness and depth of the excellent Disgaea 5 already released for PlayStation 4 to Switch Things from another world First of all, it's important to underline that that 5 shouldn't scare you, because you can safely start here even if you haven't played any Disgaea before this one. The various Disgaea, in fact, are almost completely unrelated to each other: super fans will be able to catch some sibylline quotes or references, but the bulk of the story is autonomous and practically every episode revolves around new protagonists and enemies. Disgaea 5 Complete, in this case, even acts as a prequel to the entire saga, suggesting that it is set long before the original Disgaea, Hour of Darkness. On the other hand, the additional content allows you to immediately embark on some side missions that unlock the protagonists as playable characters not only from the previous Disgaea, but also from other Nippon Ichi games such as Makai Kingdom or The Witch and the Hundred Knight. So how are things? Allow us a nice ~who cares~, after all that is the tenor of the story. If you are expecting an epic and dramatic plot, you are completely off the road: Disgaea 5 Complete immediately catapults you into a wacky universe, full of absurd characters, impossible-to-hate enemies and situations bordering on the paradoxical. Everything looks like a Japanese cartoon series, thanks also to the evergreen character design by Takehiko Harada and to the very structure of the plot, divided into episodes complete with previews. It is precisely the crazy characterization of the characters - thanks to the sparkling dialogues and the excellent adaptation in English, but purists fear not: they can also choose the dialogues in Japanese - that conquers the players who let themselves be overwhelmed by puns, double meanings and various follies. The protagonist this time is called Killia and is a foodie demon who seeks revenge on the evil Void Dark, a tyrant who is bringing the various kingdoms of the Netherworld to their knees. The Overlords who preside over them will therefore have to form an alliance of convenience, but only their personal interests move them. Seraphina, for example, will be our first ally only because she was betrothed to Void Dark and to solve the root problem she decided to assassinate him. Disgaea 5 Complete tells a story of betrayal and revenge with a black humor that draws more than a smile, but those who know the series will know very well that the plot, more often than not, only serves to show off missions after missions in which to exterminate dozens of enemies in the most creative ways possible. A thousand ways to die Seraphina's Pocket Netherworld will quickly become our base of operations. At first it may seem confusing: the hub is overflowing with non-player characters who wander around quietly or who offer us specific services that are slowly unlocking. From this point of view, Disgaea 5 Complete takes the player by the hand and slowly and organically introduces him to each new mechanic. The pace may perhaps seem too diluted, but in reality we are talking about a game so layered and full of possibilities that Nippon Ichi could not have done otherwise without risking driving the players crazy. At the base there is a seemingly traditional combat system. Once the mission has started - and witnessed the dialogues and skits that usually precede it - the player can deploy a certain number of units on the usual checkerboard map, drawing on an army that counts, in addition to the protagonists such as Killia or Seraphina, also the various soldiers previously recruited anonymous. At this point Disgaea 5 allows you to mix the order of movements and actions: in a traditional strategic RPG you will have tohad to move a unit and possibly make it act on its own turn, but in Disgaea 5 it is possible to move one, make another act, then move the latter and make the first act or in any case carry out all these actions in any order or almost . Positional strategy is key, to the point that it's even possible to lift characters (or characters who... are lifting other characters!) and throw them from one point to another on the map to gain ground. Each unit can hold two weapons and attack normally, use previously learned special abilities such as magic or secret strikes, and so on: monsters can even turn into weapons and be wielded by other characters for a certain number of rounds, opponents can be captured and so on and so forth. The Geo Panel system also returns to the fore from the previous Disgaea and allows you to manipulate the battlefield, taking advantage of the bonuses offered by the colored panels which can also be destroyed in real chain reactions. Disgaea 5 also introduces a brand new mechanic called Revenge Mode which is triggered under certain conditions - for example, after having suffered a certain number of total damage - and empowers the characters, unlocking devastating attacks that can turn the tide of a fight: better take them and get really pissed off or fight cautiously? The beauty of Disgaea 5 Complete is just that, and that is a design of the missions and an overall balance that allows for enormous customization of each encounter. In the Pocket Netherworld it is then possible not only to recruit new units but also to learn new skills and spells, make purchases, torture captured enemies or explore the ~worlds~ contained in the objects in a series of random missions that allow you to upgrade weapons and armor, guaranteeing an absolutely exceptional longevity.", "date": "2017-05-17", "grade": "8.5"}
