{"name": "Humankind", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/humankind-recensione-concorrente-serie-civilization.html", "text": "It is a truly flourishing period for the 4X genre, with several excellent quality titles that are attempting to assault the castle, i.e. the domain of the Civilization series by Firaxis Games, which has always represented the model to be compared with. The formula created by Sid Meier still appears today so fresh and perfect as to make it difficult for Firaxis itself to find a way to rejuvenate it. Yet human history still has a lot to say and the possibilities for interpreting society and its evolution are innumerable. as demonstrated a few months ago by Soren Johnson's Old World, who thought it well to inject a bit of Crusaders Kings into its gameplay, and as demonstrated by Humankind by Amplitude Studios, the subject of this review, which tries to completely change the cards on the table, interpreting different aspects of the history of human civilizations in a decidedly original way. After all, who if not the studio of Endless Legend, another excellent 4X, could have succeeded? The gameplay Started the game you need to create the game. The options available are the classic ones: you can choose the size of the world, i.e. of the map, the difficulty, the conformation of the territory, the duration and so on. Do you want a world with four continents, many rivers and a temperate climate? Take a seat. Do you like the idea of developing your empire on small islands rather than huge land masses? You are served. Basically you can do a little bit of everything. Over time, you will also be able to download maps created by developers and players. But let's not rush too much. Humankind's gameplay starts as you'd expect: it's the dawn of civilization and you lead a group of hunter-gatherers as they grapple with the perils of the vast world. The first thing to do is not to found a city, but to find enough resources to create a camp in a certain territory, so as to claim possession of it (a system similar to that already seen in Endless Legend). In a subsequent phase it will be possible to spend influence points to develop the inhabited center into a real city but, unlike what happens with other games, the result is not obvious, in the sense that it is not certain that all the camps become city immediately and, above all, that they do it where they were founded (you can move them if you want). Also because as cities increase, so does the amount of influence points to invest to develop the next one. A bird's-eye view into Humankind In this sense, the first phases are much more dynamic and less obvious than what has been seen elsewhere, where what matters is choosing the capital's foundation box well, in such a way as to immediately have enough resources to not perish to external threats. In Humankind the focus of the primitive phase is above all on exploration, with our hunters who have to look for the remnants of ancient populations that have now disappeared to accumulate resources and make sure they can claim other territories, so as to outline the shape of our future empire. The main dangers of this first phase are wild animals, which we can also hunt to obtain other resources, and other civilizations, some much less friendly than others. The map itself is very reminiscent of that seen in other titles of the genre, divided into hexagons and propped up as it is with indications on the available resources, in particular relating to the collection of food and production. There are also special assets, some known immediately, others that will be revealed when the right scientific discoveries have been made to exploit them. Exploration is strangely rewarding, with the high ground granting a better view of the surrounding territories (so more tiles are revealed) and the various points of interest only visible when a unit is actually within their range. With technological development some of these limits will disappear, but it must be said that when you have tanks you will not go around looking for herbs. The cultures The maps are very beautiful Humankind's goal is obviously to follow the path that leads from the Stone Age to the most modern technologies in the technical, social and cultural fields. Amplitude Studios has decided to manage progression with an achievement system that awards stars upon reaching certain milestones. The stars allow you to move to the next era, but also to adopt new cultures. And it is here that Humankind differs most from the Civilization model: where the canons established by Meier want culture to be determined at the beginning of the game, often in the game creation phase, Humankind chooses to make it a dynamic element and to give the player the choice of how to develop his people during its growth. So during a game it becomes possible to choose to embrace different cultures (ten in total), all with different influences on the population and its vision of the future, if we want to call it that. Despite the distance from what we have been used to playing up to now, it must be said that the system works well and offers a great variety to the games, clearly differentiating certain aspects. The point of arrival is always that of having a type of society set up to achieve certain goals, such as a peaceful victory based on scientific development (entrusted to the usual tree with selectable research), or a military one in which force crushes everything the rest. The seaside development is also well managed Let's say that in this case the novelty lies in the way a certain road is made to travel, not in the road itself. If we like, it is also a more sensible representation of human development, given that a civilization capable of maintaining a certain culture from the Stone Age to the contemporary one, without undergoing strong influences or changes, is itself an absurdity dictated by the need to simplify the process for playful purposes. Humankind offers a brilliant alternative, in terms of game mechanics, which creates natural and fascinating cultural mixtures. Do you want to boost production? Select Egyptian culture. Need more food? Then select the Celtic one. Such a dynamic cultural system also has another determining function: that of giving the player more options to deal more effectively (and sometimes quickly) with the most contingent problems. For example, it may happen that you find yourself fighting against a very aggressive civilization, which requires an increase in production to have more efficient troops, or that you are in trouble in scientific research and need to improve in that direction. Cultural flexibility therefore becomes very important for the conduct of matches and for embracing certain models and dealing with certain circumstances. Religions and political system The diplomatic system is comprehensive, but doesn't make many leaps ahead of the competition Humankind is a very complex title, as you may have understood, and it is not possible to account for all the systems that make it up in a review (unless you rewrite the entire manual). Be that as it may, there are some that deserve to be treated in a more specific way. The first is that of religions, which works more or less like the one seen in Civilization 6, with the various creeds that develop from an original nucleus then giving rise to a more complex theology, with its own articulated hierarchy made up of units that deal of the conversion of the population and of influencing the populations of different creeds. All this translates into a series of bonuses or maluses for the production of the various resources, which intersect with those provided by other systems. Honestly, it's not exactly the best in terms of depth, but for now there are no valid alternative models, at least for this type of 4X (if you want something more articulated in this sense, look at Crusader Kings III, which however offers a completely different game). The political system, or civics, instead allows you to make choices related to society, responding to the dilemmas that are posed to us during the game, which influence not only certain founding values of the same, but also its ideology. For example, one can choose between natural and divine law, increasing the value of progressivism in the first case, and that of traditionalism in the second. The match can be customized All the civics put together form a kind of very complex tree, which determines the kind of society we want to create. Ideologies are also influenced by the events that happen from time to time and which require us to make important decisions, which can move the bar towards this or that ideology. Perhaps it is preferable to drive out the villager who has appropriated a reserve of mushrooms, or to exploit him by making him study them until he lives? The individual choices seem simple, but if we mix all the systems involved we find ourselves faced with a very complex picture, in which our vision of the match is called into question every time: we will decide for the collective good, to stay in line with what have we professed with our actions or to obtain productive advantages? Cities and territories Founding a city means taking an entire territory As we have mentioned, the development of cities in Humankind is different from that of other 4X, because it is doubly linked to that of the terwhere they are located. Each city has its center, with the immediately surrounding tiles exploited for productive purposes. With the development it will therefore be possible to build internal buildings or structures that occupy an entire square, altering its values. There is no shortage of special buildings, those elsewhere called wonders, which provide different bonuses depending on their function. So far, however, the model does not seem too different from that of a last generation Civilization. The difference, however, is precisely in the very concept of territory: capturing a city means capturing the entire region in which it was founded, which translates into in very different evaluations compared to those made in Firaxis titles when it comes to attacking or defending. Another difference compared to the competition are the fights, which can be automatic or managed by hand, with the troops deployed taking turns. Culture is important The latter system is particularly useful when dealing with very large wars in which the forces are in substantial balance. Naturally, managing everything directly lengthens the time of the matches considerably, so after a while we tend to entrust the clashes with the most obvious outcomes to the CPU. The diplomatic system, on the other hand, is not very different from that seen elsewhere and allows you to discuss treaties and alliances with other civilizations, as well as to declare war or make concessions to have peace. From this point of view, a title like Old World, which introduced a Crusader Kings-style relationship system, turns out to be much more complex and satisfying, even if it must be said that it is deficient from other points of view. However, diplomacy is always one of the most controversial elements of 4X, since it is really difficult for the CPU to handle. Other advantages and some problems Armies deployed in the field For those wondering, Humankind's artificial intelligence performs really well, especially on the higher difficulty levels. Let's say that it is often the AI that dictates the pace of the games, forcing quick responses to its decisions and implementing interesting tactics. After all, Amplitude had already shown that it can do it from this point of view with Endless Legend, so Humankind is only a confirmation of the studio's capabilities. A praise also goes to the interface, very clear and easy to use, despite being very different from the classic models. Let's say that also in this case the experience made by the studio with other titles has been decisive and the result is a modern and captivating style, overall minimalist, which however does not give up on clarity and functionality. Be that as it may, in case of problems, there is a very clear tutorial that explains all the main functions. Of course we're talking about a 4X, so you still need some study before you start to fully understand what you're doing. But these are trivialities that fans of the genre will surely take for granted. One of Humankind's most relevant problems is certainly the pace of play, sometimes too high. We tried to play quick games and very slow games and, if in the latter we managed to enter our civilization without problems, in the first many things seemed too hasty, so much so that we lost some units along the way and we were forced to run continuously. The splendor of Egyptian culture in Humankind Of course, this can be remedied by not creating games that are too fast, or by doing it only after trying complete games, so to speak. Another small drawback of the game system is paradoxically found in the system of cultures, which can be adopted by only one civilization at a time with the cry of ~first come~. This makes sense from the point of view of the development of human history, but put this way it is another invitation to race so as not to lose the opportunity to choose the desired culture, otherwise you will have to fall back on something else. These two issues especially weigh on the middle game, where you risk losing more than what Humankind has to offer. From a technical point of view, however, Amplitude Studios has done an excellent job: the maps are always detailed and varied, as are the units and animations. We are on high levels for the 4X genre, which is usually not cited for its technical virtues. It is important to underline that in the many hours spent with the game, we have never had stability problems and we have not encountered particular bugs, a sign that the many months spent in beta have done it really good.
