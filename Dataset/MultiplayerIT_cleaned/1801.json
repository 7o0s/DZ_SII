{"name": "Mouse Logitech MX 700 Cordless Optical", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mouse-logitech-mx-700-cordless-optical.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Performance I found a good behavior of the optical unit on different types of surfaces, from any mouse pad, to the desk, even to a cloth: on each of them the performance does not seem to vary particularly. If someone wants to point out the consumption of the batteries as a possible defect, note that this is a relative and in any case secondary fact, if one takes into account that thanks to the support base, recharging takes place in a maximum of two hours - but if it is a partial it will take much less. Furthermore, the device is equipped with an energy saving system that automatically goes into standby after not being used for a few minutes; then just move it to activate it again. The only significant flaw - and unfortunately this penalizes an otherwise excellent mouse - as well as the downside of the captivating design is the chassis: conceived for the right-handed user, both in shape and in the placement of the buttons, it makes use with the hand very difficult left. Apart from that the behavior of the device is excellent. The professional user will immediately love this mouse for its seductive line and for the comfortable sensation it gives, and above all for the advanced browsing functions offered by the 8 buttons. The inveterate gamer will instead appreciate its stability and good balance, the precision of the pointing, which resists even abrupt and sudden changes of direction without losing track of the impressed direction. Unreal Tournament 2003, Mechwarrior 4, Warcraft 3, Morrowind, Hitman 2. On these and other games  of different genres and types  the performances have always been satisfactory and the configurability high. Suitable for both FPS and strategic gaming, the MX 700, with its many buttons, puts everything just a click away and significantly speeds up the gaming experience.

I can give some advice to users looking for a good replacement for purely playful products like the Razer: update the Mouseware drivers with version 9.75 or higher, which finally removes the annoying problem that afflicted Logitech peripherals in the gaming environment, making the scroll wheel unusable. With the latest driver versions, even Windows XP users will be able to overcome the inconvenience and play with all the features offered by this valid mouse. A commendable product therefore, both in technical and aesthetic realization, penalized however by the high price which does not make it affordable for all budgets. The MX 700 leaves most other optical mice far behind - including numerous other models from Logitech itself - and manages to satisfy all types of users flawlessly.Pro Accurate Convenient Rechargeable Cons Right-handed only A bit expensive [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] A first (fascinated) look... Recommended price: 89.00 Euros Bundle: Mouse, receiver unit/battery charger; two AA-type rechargeable batteries; manual and software. There's no question: Logitech designers know how to make a living. To realize this, just look at the latest mouse in the already wide range, the MX 700, an optical and cordless pointing device, which sports an attractive line without appearing too flashy, and above all it does not stop at mere appearance as regards its excellent quality. Oh yes, in this case the stereotype of the expensive and beautiful product but with poor performance is debunked; in this case it is still expensive, but definitely worth the price. The very rapid evolution of optical technology and Logitech's experience in this field have allowed the conception of this high-end product with decidedly superior performance in terms of precision and adaptability. While on the one hand the supple design and the captivating look - already typical of the MX 500 ~younger brother~ - which immediately capture the attention, the good number of buttons and the handle with a natural and safe feeling do not escape either, which you can feel once you put your fingers on the hull. Some may not like the too soft scroll wheel, but I assure you that in this case the smoothness does not lose precision when shooting, on the contrary, everything gives an idea of solidity and flexibility at the same time. The package includes, in addition to the device, the manual and the CD-ROM with the drivers, the rechargeable batteries and thereceiver unit, which also acts as a support base and battery charger. Connected both to the USB or PS2 port and to the external power supply, the base provides for complete recharging in less than two hours and allows the mouse to be stored safely and in plain sight. Installation is extremely simple, especially via the USB port, and the convenience of optical positioning is priceless: the nightmare of the ball and rotation bearings covered in dust has come to an end.", "date": "2003-01-17", "grade": null}
