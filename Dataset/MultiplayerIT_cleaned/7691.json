One of the games of the Kyoto developer to have had the greatest appreciation is undoubtedly PixelJunk Monsters, tower defense full of personality that debuted first on PS3, and later landed on PSP with a Deluxe version, which also contains the Encore expansion. Following Sony's policy of bringing some very popular games of recent years back to the Vita, PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate HD is essentially a high-definition port of the PSP edition, featuring a few small additions to the formula of what for many was one of the most interesting titles of the old portable console. Only graphics and no content make PixelJunk Monsters a listless port Playstation 3 trophies Not much stuff for Trophies lovers, since those of Monsters are all bronze and are linked to a series of additional challenges, ranging from completing a certain level without using gems or using only a certain type of turrets. To make the tower you need the tree However, it was not Q-Games who took care of this new version of Monsters, but Double Eleven, the Middlesbrough studio which collaborated in the creation of LittleBigPlanet for Vita but whose focus is currently on the conversion and publication of independent games for the portable console. The British team has thus preferred to embellish and re-propose the original title without any additions in terms of content: no new levels, no new or extra modes to unlock. This is probably the aspect that leaves you most dissatisfied: those who have already played the PSP chapter abundantly have no reason to even take a look at this Ultimate edition. The high resolution graphics are obviously not enough to replay the same levels, and the Double Eleven guys could easily have enriched the game without necessarily distorting it, adding some content that went beyond a handful of bronze trophies. In short, with PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate HD we return to wearing the mask of Tikiman, a small savage who must at all costs protect his children from hungry animals and monsters. Anyone who has played any tower defense will know the basic structure by heart, made up of waves of enemies with different characteristics and defensive turrets to place and upgrade. All in order to stop every single opponent before they reach the base in the center of the map. To build a unit, however, it is necessary to physically move Tikiman and make him climb one of the trees placed in the scenario, which already implies two particular aspects: on the one hand, the player can only place his defenses in pre-established points, which depending on the map can be more or less scattered or more or less numerous; on the other hand, you have to think carefully about your actions and their order, because the funny protagonist, no matter how hard he tries to run, will take some time to move from one part of the map to another. Monsters: Ultimate HD combines the controls via stick and directional keys with simple input via the touch screen, but after a bit of testing we preferred to go back to the old system. In addition to building turrets, moving Tikiman also serves to collect coins dropped by opponents, rummage in the trees in search of more money or collect the precious gems that appear by eliminating some monsters. If coins are spent to buy new towers, gems certainly represent one of the most important strategic elements of Monsters: based on the type and number of enemies that make up a wave, the player must constantly choose whether to spend gems to unlock new and powerful units or whether to invest them to upgrade the turrets already placed on the ground. It seems like a small decision, but one that in many cases can drastically affect the outcome of a match. These choices must be made quickly, because at the slightest hesitation you risk being overwhelmed by too numerous a wave, but in the end this is precisely the strong point of the Q-Games game. Monsters is a very difficult tower defense game. It certainly is for a matter of balancing the enemies and the strength of one's towers, but above all it is because of its always continuous and pounding rhythm. In many exponents of the genre, even among the most popular ones, there is always some more or less brief moment in which it is possible to let one's guard down without risking being overwhelmed; after all, just a few good moves and your defense is able to repel more than a few waves. In Monsters this is not the case: every scenario ismade so that Tikiman is constantly running, that the player is always having to make decisions, whether it's building an anti-aircraft turret, collecting coins or selling an expendable unit to make more money. Precisely this dynamism makes multiplayer games even more engaging and unpredictable, which online or locally allow you to collaborate to complete the same levels of the single-player campaign. It's just a pity that winning those scenarios in company does not mean progressing even in single-player, an aspect that perhaps is designed not to make the lives of the players too much easier, but which in reality ends up making a game that is not at all suitable even more difficult and severe to those users who get discouraged after the first two or three game overs.", "date": "2013-08-02", "grade": "8.0"}
