Having bought the game and installed it, created the profile and account, registered the copy and started the game, the user is still far from being able to fly in the immense skies of Condor. It takes patience  a lot  and a certain willpower, virtues that pay off little by little. Indeed, giving a brief glance at the manual, one perceives how the obsessive attention to detail has been maximum, so much so that once on the vehicle and before being carried into the air by the twin-engine specially placed at the edge of the track, a turn towards the tutorial is mandatory. Flight school is divided into five separate chapters, introduced by a brief written explanation and all in all well constructed. Learning how to manage flaps and pedals are not subtleties but indispensable necessities, just as deepening the use of air currents and performing the first stunts will be fundamental pieces in the sophisticated puzzle of fun built here. A few hours of effort are enough to lift spirits and, having understood the interface and having come to terms with the almost complete use of the keyboard, the satisfactions will not be long in coming. The mode for single player takes the very clear, almost laconic name of Free Flight: no mission in particular or a special goal; after all, when is an emergency ever solved or a glider job done? On the other hand, customization is at the highest levels starting from the route which, taking a look at the map, must be traced according to the time available and, consequently, the wind and the morphology of the terrain. As with a mechanical watch, matches will acquire progressive value as the complications put into play increase. Weather conditions and turbulence demonstrate the ability to conduct, while the different models offer cues for disparate reflections. Obviously all this realism can be calmed down by reducing certain parameters which, however, prove to be crucial in not flattening and trivializing the experience. You can also view scores and statistics, so you can set goals and convince yourself that there is a higher purpose to which you must be accountable. Group flight and air gaps Having practiced, the new Wright can indulge himself on the Net - or on the LAN, of course - choosing from a good amount of options. The games are spread across several servers and contemplate both the simple pleasure that is obtained by hovering in company, and a challenge mode that rewards the one, or in the case of team division, those who first complete the path chosen by the host. Nothing revolutionary but generally sufficient, this group scenario takes shape if you then want to pay attention to the data analysis and take a, albeit fleeting, look at the replays. Physics deserves a separate discussion, taken so seriously as to convince programmers not to include a media editor, potentially amusing but unable to make the memory of Newton and the imagination of the players coexist coherently. On the other hand, new gliders will be periodically made available for the price of a modest sum, so as not to let the veil of indifference drop. From a purely aesthetic point of view, Condor: The Competition Soaring Sim leaves rather dumbfounded. Unfortunately, the engine used does not have an impact comparable to that of many illustrious colleagues, Flight Simulator above all, and shows the side of criticism in almost every aspect: from not very rich polygonal models, to settings with almost monochromatic and fluctuating textures. However, a certain functionality remains: the feeling that the audience to which it is addressed is looking elsewhere. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Processor: Pentium 3 800 MHz RAM: 256 MB Video Card: 3D 32 MB Disk Space: 600 MB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Pentium 4 1.5 GHz RAM: 512 MB Video Card: 3D 32 MB Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz HT RAM: 1 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 7900 Comment The twenty-five readers of this article  the last one who wrote something similar was lucky  will by now have understood that voting is in this case an inexact science: Condor is totally attached to the passion of a few, who will find in it a good simulator, in contrast to the inevitable refusal of many, light years away from wanting to test themselves with such a difficult and unattractive challenge from an aesthetic point of view. Not a masterpiece, to be objective above all other considerations, but still a positive one. Perhaps the almost fifty euros required to have it, yes, those that will make everyone agree that they are too many. A demo would be perfect but, as of yet, it's not available. Pros The gliders and their well-crafted physicsand fugitive Against Technically transfixed Arduo An editor is missing Condor: Glider Simulator is available on PC. In the early days there were a few well-defined genres: when you didn't have to shoot enemies, they were moving platforms or puzzles of increasing difficulty. However, the fascinating world of video games has grown day by day, establishing itself and exponentially increasing its diffusion. If the consoles are still the territory of many but not all, the too often reviled personal computer makes use of a potential user of about a billion people, interested in the most disparate activities. Thus, a simulator for almost everything, for almost every taste and, ultimately, for almost everyone makes sense. This is the case of Condor: The Competition Soaring Sim, with which you can virtually experience the emotions that you can really experience when driving the aerodyne known as a glider. Just to be clear, we are in the presence of a rough and pretentious product, made for those who really love free flight; a large part of the resources made available to the developers, in fact, have been spent on studying physics and dynamics rather than textures and shaders. In short, if you thought Flight Simulator was for a few, get ready to find out what it means to be part of a niche.", "date": "2007-09-24", "grade": null}
