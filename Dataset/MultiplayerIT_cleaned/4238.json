{"name": "La recensione di The Fall", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/199833-the-fall-la-recensione-di-the-fall.html", "text": "Following the strange cases of the gaming market, the sequel to the progenitor on Switch landed first of The Fall, obviously creating some confusion as the two chapters are linked by the same story. The first was in fact released a few years ago on Wii U and its conversion on Switch was not even obvious given the time that has passed, so we still welcome the possibility of restoring the order of things with the arrival of the first chapter on the new console Nintendo. This is a side-shot adventure that falls into the ~2.5D~ category, with three-dimensional graphics applied to a classic 2D scrolling structure. The story takes up a theme that has already been addressed several times in science fiction, but which is treated here with a surprisingly original attitude: the protagonist of the events is in fact the artificial intelligence of a space suit, ARID, which comes into action to protect the human inside it. This already determines an atypical setting, as the ~body~ that we find ourselves moving around the levels is in fact inanimate and unknown, being unconscious, while the protagonist is precisely the suit that moves the character. The need to ensure human safety, as per the fundamental directives of ARID, triggers various particular situations, for which we find ourselves having to think about how to bypass the standard protocols in the absence of direct instructions from the ~master~, putting risking his own health or even breaking the basic rules of robotics to achieve the goal. All of this leads to a process of learning and self-awareness on the part of artificial intelligence, which progressively finds itself facing questions about its very nature and its capacity for conservation and self-determination. A suit for a friend The central argument is a sort of classic of existentialist science fiction, or the border between machine and living being, which becomes blurred when artificial intelligence is so advanced as to be able to make one's way of reasoning indistinguishable from that of a human. In The Fall, the precariousness of this border is laid bare by a series of tests to which ARID is subjected, which lead it to make the definitive leap in quality precisely in learning to think outside the box, bypassing the limits set by the man to his behavior and tackling puzzles in a particularly creative way. All this takes on a rather ironic meaning because the one who must actually resort to lateral thinking and develop solutions to the various puzzles is the player himself, who must step into the shoes of artificial intelligence also learning to exploit the mechanisms and stakes imposed by the code of programming. This double game is a particularly interesting feature, and the puzzle design is well thought out in order to leverage this contrast between mechanical action, in response to basic inputs, and an atypical solution that bends the normal patterns of interpretation of artificial intelligence. The dark story full of mystery supports the action well, which however does not dwell too much, since everything can be completed in less than five hours (between three and four in most cases), and the dark characterization of the strange planet in which ARID finds itself mysteriously missing, together with the disturbing presences of the other androids we are dealing with, works well as a stimulus to find the solution to the strange case in which we find ourselves immersed. An imperfect adventure So far we have mainly considered the positive aspects of the game, talking about the excellent starting idea, the good story and the construction of the puzzles, but The Fall presents itself as a strange hybrid also containing pseudo-action elements that demonstrate some shortcomings and in the overall demonstrate poor integration with the adventure mechanics. Basically, the interaction takes place largely as a classic point and click graphic adventure, with the possibility of acting on elements of the scenery and characters, collecting and using objects. The first problem is given by the style adopted on the graphic front: the 2D system with few colors and strong chiaroscuro contrasts always has a remarkable effect from an artistic point of view, recalling Playdead titles a bit, but it is rather awkward to put stage a graphic adventure, also considering that to examine and interact with sensitive objects it is always necessary to use the gun/torch. In short, the interface is rather cumbersome, which does not go well with the hermeticism of some puzzles, which perhaps require a littleof experiments. Another critical element are the fights, which are always rather clumsy and mechanical, even these not assisted by a particularly precise and reactive control system, so much so that we wonder if it was really necessary to include this element in a game that could probably be based simply on its graphic adventure structure. There is no doubt that the composite system makes The Fall an original title, but greater integration between the parts and a more intuitive control system would probably have significantly improved the gaming experience.", "date": "2018-05-27", "grade": "7.5"}
