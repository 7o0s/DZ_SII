{"name": "Joint Task Force - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/joint-task-force-recensione.html", "text": "Damn probable Joint Task Force will see you involved, at least initially, in an absolutely plausible scenario: following violent armed clashes and a particularly critical situation, Somalia has definitively collapsed into the abyss of civil war, seeing the Warlords face each other to conquer the power. As usually happens on an international level, the United Nations decides to intervene to stop these excesses of blood and violence, sending a contingent of peace to calm the waters. So here are the premises to allow you to take control of an elite team of the UN, precisely called the Joint Task Force, with the arduous task of restoring a situation of peace in the territory, as well as guaranteeing respect for human rights. If, from a first point of view, the plot is the usual pretext to introduce you to the action, we can assure you that it will never lapse into banality and, during the missions, it will also be able to surprise you with some small but effective twists far from being as good as WarCraft 3 or Act of War. The entire game campaign will see you engaged not only in African locations, but you will also be called to operate in mountainous, forest areas (someone said Colombia?) and towns, all always following the plot conceived by the developers. It's not RAI Obviously, working for an organization such as the United Nations, you will have to pay particular attention to the first of a long series of changes made by Mithis to the gameplay, or the Media. While in all other games (except for Combat Zone of many years ago), the mass media were bound to perform only the function of evolving the plot, or informing the player about new events, in Joint Task Force it will represent the element fundamental around which all the gameplay will revolve: in fact, through a comfortable indicator placed in the upper part of the screen, you will be able to observe how much favor you will enjoy from televisions and newspapers from all over the world. as happens in the vast majority of strategy titles, the combat system will be based on the principle of the Chinese pen It's not RAI When you start your campaign, the indicator will be perfectly in the center of the bar, thus showing a neutral situation: each of your actions will correspond to an increase or decrease in media favor, with a consequent increase or decrease in funds to obtain reinforcements . This therefore means that if one of your tanks kills a civilian, you will have to expect a strong negative reaction, while if you manage to successfully complete a secondary objective, without excessively damaging civilian and innocent structures, you will be able to collect a fair amount of favor towards you . Needless to specify that, in case you have the media against you, you will not be able to request any reinforcements, and you will have to finish the mission with a handful of men and means, a situation which given the tactical imprint of the title, will almost certainly lead you to a premature game overs; on the contrary, if you have instead managed to bring the Citizen Kane to your side, expect a continuous stream of ever more advanced and ever more devastating means, ready to crush these hateful Warlords. For your 18th birthday, I'll buy you an Abrahms Given the tacticity of the title, you can definitively abandon your tank-rushing strategies, which will only lead you to an enormous loss of men, means and reputation. As happens in the vast majority of strategy titles, the combat system will follow the principle of the Chinese morra: one unit will be particularly effective against another, but decidedly vulnerable to attacks from a third. This will therefore force you to make your contingent as heterogeneous as possible, without fossilising on the accumulation of a single unit: collecting tanks, absolutely deadly against the vehicles available to the guerrillas, will prove to be a decidedly inadequate choice when you will also have to face a single helicopter or an aircraft armed with air-to-ground missiles, such as the classic A10 Warthog. Regarding the vehicles at your disposal, and given the choice of presenting itself as an RTS title based on modern warfare, the developers will allow you to choose from a vast fleet of vehicles, all of US production (but didn't we work for the UN?) and actually exist, including heavy Abrahms and B2 stealth bombers. Unfortunately, all soldiers have great difficulty moving within the maps, especially in the presence of numerous obstacles, such as fences or rubble: often, in fact, by ordering the movement of a unit, it will proceedit is exactly in a straight line, except collide with any object and continue to go at it, forcing you to periodically check that some of your units have not become entangled somewhere. How much stuff can I destroy! With regard to the game environment, it is essential to underline the high destructibility of what surrounds you, all perfectly simulated by the advanced AGEIA physics system: following an explosion, you will see thousands of shrapnel and debris flying from all sides, poles of the light breaking on the ground bringing to the ground whole meters of wires, glass shattering and so on; if then, that an enemy soldier is found near the explosion, you will see his body thrown away, with a decidedly realistic simulation of the rag-doll, as well as immense personal satisfaction. Besides offering you dynamic weather effects, you can enjoy beautiful particle effects, such as smoke and explosions How much stuff can I destroy! If you add to this that any ~collateral damage~ modifies the game map in a sensitive and palpable way, get ready to always come up with new strategies: the sudden collapse of a building can help you hinder the advance of an enemy contingent, even if you always have to consider the reverse side of the coin, or the fact that the enemies will use these same guerrilla tactics to push you towards a certain area, specially prepared for an ambush. A beautifully crafted physical system, however, would be useless if it weren't accompanied by graphics at its height: fortunately, Joint Task Force shows all the effort made by Mithis's boys in this sector. In addition to offering you dynamic atmospheric effects, capable of actively influencing the dynamics of the game, you will be able to enjoy splendid particle effects, such as smoke and explosions, as well as the ability to zoom in at will on the battlefield, up to admire even the smallest details. However, some animations of the characters are, especially in the case of the infantry, particularly woody and in some situations not very pleasant to look at, sometimes generating curious clipping effects. I love the smell of napalm If the complete absence of managerial elements may have made those expecting yet another clone of Age of Empires turn up their noses, one can be heartened by the presence of particular units, identified in the game as Heroes: these characters, unlike what we games such as Act of War or Command & Conquer are used to, they are not war machines capable of exterminating an entire enemy contingent without any difficulty, but they will be almost as vulnerable as the classic units, except for the possibility of making use of some special abilities and using a wider choice of weapons. This choice adopted by the developers makes the decision to make Joint Task Force as plausible as possible a title particularly evident, without introducing fantastic or unrealistic elements: therefore, the decision to allow your units to take possession of weapons also fits perfectly in this context and vehicles dropped by your enemies, introducing the ability to further vary the composition and effectiveness of your army. I love the smell of napalm This concept, although not particularly new (clearly copied from Heroes of WWII), introduces a further tactical element to which the player will have to pay particular attention, working carefully on the micro-management of each of his command units, which during the campaign they will hardly reach excessive dimensions (we are speaking in the order of a maximum of twenty units). The arduous task of managing is combined with the possibility of taking direct control of any of the units under your command, as if you were moving it directly on the field, using the arrow keys: this choice, again copied from another previous strategic , allows for an even greater degree of identification during battles, in which you can take part as if it were a third-person action game. Multiplayer for everyone The possibility of facing friends in online competitions is currently offered by the vast majority of titles on the market, and Joint Task Force does not deviate from this current of thought: you will be able to engage in wild fights with up to 8 players on a fair number of maps, some taken from those of the single-player game and adapted for the occasion. You will be able to clash in devastating (for the game environment) deathmatch games, or collaborate in cooperative games: a decisive point in favor of the title is given by the possibility of takingthe control of two unplayable factions in the single-player campaign, namely the Terrorists, capable of deploying many economic units, preferring quantity rather than quality, and the Dictators, who instead have decidedly resistant units, but with low firepower . despite the significant positive aspects of Joint Task Force, a series of more or less annoying flaws undermine its playability Multiplayer for everyone Even this possibility of using new factions recalls, broadly speaking, the gameplay introduced by Command & Conquer: Generals, where the US faction (here represented by the JTF) enjoyed technologically advanced and expensive troops, while the GDA (i.e. the Terrorists) could count on low-cost and even more low-performance means, with the third solution offered by China (alias Dictators), which offered an interesting mix of elements between the two previous factions: it follows that, however satisfying and satisfying it may be to succeed to destroy the last unit of a dear friend of yours, the multiplayer mode of Joint Task Force will hardly go down in history, given the total absence of new modes and innovative elements. Final comment It seems evident that the developers of Mithis have assimilated the best elements of the latest real-time strategy (including AoE 3, Heroes of WWII, Combat Zone and C&C: Generals), to churn out a title capable of encompassing them all: despite the remarkable aspects positives of Joint Task Force, a series of more or less annoying flaws undermine its playability, first of all the classic chimera of Artificial Intelligence, which proves to be not very aggressive and incapable of developing complex strategies. However, JTF presents itself as an excellent game, strongly based on tactical action, and without a shadow of a doubt one of the best RTS currently on the market: more attention and finishing work would have been enough to bring it to the Valhalla of Videogames.Pro Absence of micromanagement Great graphics Destructible environments Cons Excessive hardware demands Boring in the long run Uninspired multiplayer For some years now, the real-time strategy genre had fallen victim to repetitiveness, due to a gameplay that was too stagnant, and it didn't matter if the troops were historical or fantastic: everything always boiled down to a continuous accumulation of resources , then launch the final attack and overwhelm the enemy. A small part of developers, to overcome this trend, decided to follow the trend started by Ground Control, totally suppressing the management part, preferring it to the purely tactical one: Joint Task Force (JTF for brevity) fits into this small circle; and with excellent results.", "date": "2006-09-16", "grade": null}
