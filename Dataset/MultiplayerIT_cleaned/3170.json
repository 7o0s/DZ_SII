{"name": "Control: The Foundation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/control-the-foundation-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Control: The Foundation has allowed us to return to the role of Jesse Faden, the new Director of the Federal Bureau of Control, to venture into a mission that takes place in the most hidden and sinister part of the Oldest House: its large and dark foundations. There is something wrong down there, among the disturbing caves that we had only seen in passing in the campaign of the game, and it seems that the disappearance of Helen Marshall is linked to these mysterious events, which threaten the very balance of the our reality. Accessible only after completing the main story, the first expansion for the Remedy Entertainment title adopts a traditional structure, involving us in the search for four different seals that we will have the task of freeing in order to restore a huge object of power, the Nail , which has the function of keeping the dimensions separate. However, the unlocking of two new skills, Creation and Breaking, will lead us to face the mini-campaign in a different order depending on the choices made. history and structure If you have read our review of Control you will certainly know that the latest action shooter created by the authors of Alan Wake and Quantum Break has a truly fascinating plot on its side, narrated in a very particular way but which unfortunately lacks the proverbial icing on the cake , represented by the dubbing in Italian: a waiver that burns especially if we consider that the game has dialogues spoken in all European languages except ours. The Foundation tries to consolidate the suggestive lore created by Sam Lake, Anna Megill and Brooke Maggs, but the relatively short duration (the expansion can be completed in four or five hours, depending on the secondary quests tackled and the collectibles you want to obtain) leaves little room for insights and the directing times necessary to build a certain type of tale. Structural simplicity is thus also reflected in the narrative, which comes out rather weakened and cannot in any way rival what was seen in the original campaign. As mentioned at the beginning, Jesse Faden's new mission will see us explore the foundations of the Oldest House in search of four seals which, once restored, should put things right and avoid the disintegration of the universe. For the ~no pressure~ series. We are therefore talking about four specific areas, connected to each other by a series of caves generally sparsely populated by enemies, so much so that, especially in the early stages, one remains a bit dumbfounded given that the challenges are lacking. The choice of which new ability to unlock first among the aforementioned Creation and Breaking will lead us to face one path rather than another, meeting different gameplay solutions. Creation in fact allows you to use telekinetic powers to make crystals sprout from certain surfaces, usable both as platforms to reach higher points and as a trap for opponents, specifically when spikes suddenly arise from the ground. Breaking instead translates into the simple ability of the Service Weapon to destroy these crystals where for some reason they block the path, but even here this often takes on a strategic value, see the floors or bridges that we can blow up while being traversed by hostile creatures . Gameplay and technical realization The excellent gameplay of Control is reproposed in The Foundation in all its facets, with the addition of the aforementioned extra skills and a power that allows you to give a further offensive value to the debris shield that the protagonist can create at any time to protect themselves from enemy fire. The arrangement of the seals leads to encountering sections organized in a different way, for example there are some that greatly emphasize the platform element mixing it with environmental puzzles while we try to figure out which path to follow to get from time to time to the desired point. There is also a very complicated side mission in which you find yourself fighting aboard a fast-moving platform in order to ~exorcise~ a new object of power, and several moments in which the bestiary created by Remedy Entertainment is unleashed against us in a decisive way, with dozens and dozens of enemies (some unpublished) who attack from various sides and often try to reset the distances in order to injure us. It goes without saying that facing the expansion with the maximum, or almost, power-ups, becomes an obligatory choice to avoid episodes of frustration and repeating the same clashes several times. From a technical point of view, the values in the field are the same as always, even if the direction artistic in this case fails to exert who knows what influence on the final result. The already mentioned side mission of the moving platform probably represents the peak of the visual experimentation of The Foundation, but we also appreciated the panoramas of the astral plane, while the caves did not give us who knows what sensations. On PC the graphics are always great see and the adjustments are numerous, allowing you to scale the experience even on less demanding configurations. In our case we were able to keep the 60 frames per second with all effects maxed out by opting for an effective resolution of 1440p (but with output at 2160p). Ray tracing obviously gives a big hand in visually enriching the game, but with a video card that is not RTX, and which therefore does not also have the important DLSS optimizations, you have to make important compromises to keep it activated at 1080p and stay on 30 fps. In conclusion... The Foundation is a nice but not overwhelming expansion, especially if we consider the value of Control's basic campaign. interesting and there is no shortage of particularly intense sequences, in which you really have to make the most of your resources to survive. The platform phases with puzzle elements are the thing we liked the most, and in general the DLC stands as a valid purchase if you missing playing the role of Jesse Faden and using the spectacular mix of weapons and powers that characterizes the experience signed by Remedy Entertainment.", "date": "2020-03-26", "grade": null}
