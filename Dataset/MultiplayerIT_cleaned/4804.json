Despite the title, the references and the artistic direction in general, Valkyria Revolution is a real spin-off set in an alternative universe: it is in no way connected to the first adventure that launched the series, nor to the two sequels published for PSP. In this way, the developer Media.Vision was able to take liberties and direct the brand towards a new horizon, looking for a future in which to evolve a series that unfortunately has never shone in terms of sales. Unfortunately, the development has gone through some problems - first of all the need to develop it cross-gen also for PlayStation Vita, with all the technical consequences of the case - which have held back the potential of a series which, with this ~revolutionary~ incarnation, risks to make more enemies than friends. This is a true story Clarified that there is no narrative connection between Valkyria Revolution and the three Valkyria Chronicles that preceded it, it must be admitted that the premises we are introduced to in the very first minutes of the adventure are decidedly intriguing. The story, in fact, is essentially told by a teacher to her pupil, both in front of a plaque dedicated to five notorious ~traitors~ who allegedly instigated the war between the Ruzhien empire and the weak region of Jutland for pure and simple revenge . The story therefore begins in the form of a dialogue, but soon turns into a flashback that illustrates in detail what really happened, putting us in the shoes of Amleth Grnkjr, the leader of the aforementioned traitors and of the anti-Valkyrie Vanargand unit. Unfortunately, if there's one thing that Valkyria Revolution lacks, it's absolutely pacing. The story translates into an infinity of cinematics and dialogues in the game engine, often separated by long loads even when they last literally a handful of seconds. If the intent of Media.Vision was to involve us in the complex socio-political panorama of a world in the midst of the industrial revolution, perhaps it should have better told us about the protagonists before the conspiracies that concern them. Unfortunately, the fault also lies with the technical sector. The movements of the characters are rigid, their expressiveness almost non-existent and so even the most dramatic moments lose intensity if the lines are recited by real stockfish. The fluctuating - but generally very mediocre - dubbing hammers a nail in the coffin of the presentation, making the experience frustrating due to the very long dead times between one mission and another and boring when the story seems to prepare for twists that never come or that we managed to predict hours in advance. Fortunately, the score by the extraordinary Yasunori Mitsuda often intervenes to save as much as possible, but even the composer seems to struggle to find his dimension. It's a real shame because the last few hours are much more interesting than the rest of the adventure, but the overall duration of the game is rather small and the ratio certainly doesn't play in favor of the result. In this sense, the decision to implement a form of ~permanent death~ regarding supporting characters is understandable: if they are shot down, and we don't revive them before the end of the mission, those soldiers are lost forever and we simply won't see the dialogues or the sequences of the story that concern them. The problem is that their influence on the main campaign and on the story of the Traitors is almost nil, so their thin characterization certainly does not encourage you to keep them alive, if not for their usefulness in terms of the time invested in customizing them. Playstation 4 trophies Unlocking the 10 bronze, 11 silver and 6 gold trophies that preside over the platinum trophy is not a particularly difficult undertaking: most literally come by themselves by completing the various missions of the campaign, while for the others you have to work hard a little more. The strategy of chaos Maybe the PlayStation Vita version was a prisoner, because otherwise it wouldn't be explained how Media.Vision was able to offer a title on PlayStation 4 that at times appears even inferior to that Valkyria Chronicles of nine years ago. The Gouache Drawing Engine has replaced SEGA's older CANVAS with the intention of staying true to the ~painting on canvas~ style of the original Valkyria Chronicles, while taking advantage of an overall streamlining in polygonal modeling and texture coloring which, in theory,it should have made the images cleaner and more pleasant. Indeed it happened, but it also made the landscapes much more confused and dull, especially in the maps that are particularly rich in detail. Unfortunately, the maps in question are relatively numerous and there is often an insistent recycling of assets and floor plans, not to mention the all the same enemies that we will face in waves. In fact, Valkyria Revolution abandons almost any claim to strategy to dive into the panorama of musou or, better, into a strange border space that exists between musou, turn-based JRPGs and real-time strategy. In fact, in Valkyria Revolution we will directly control one character at a time in teams of up to four members. The clashes all take place in real time: once we have spotted an enemy on the battlefield, we just need to press a key to attack, one to dodge or another to call up a circular menu from which we can choose whether to use consumable items, shoot with firearms or employ the alchemical powers bestowed by Ragnite, the mineral over which war is essentially waged. An indicator will discharge every time we perform an action and at that point we will have to wait for it to recharge before thinking about the next one, whether it is the casting of an elemental ~spell~ or a very simple attack with a white weapon. A whole series of factors have a transversal effect on the clashes, such as the indicator of the morale of the enemies or the elemental weak points, but in reality everything is very easy even at the standard difficulty level, also and above all due to an extremely incomplete artificial intelligence. Outflanking enemies and grouping them in a limited space to unleash some particularly effective area-of-effect attacks on them is child's play and within minutes it becomes clear that the only really important skill is the one that increases recovery speed. action indicator: at that point, just literally load the opposing teams and repeatedly press the attack button, alternating it with some area skills, to take out every enemy even if we were playing Dynasty Warriors. The indicator in question, which is so reminiscent of Final Fantasy's ATB, is the player's real enemy, especially when facing the bosses at the end of the most important missions: they are not particularly difficult opponents, but they are very tough and fighting them becomes quick more boring than exciting. At a certain point, Media.Vision must have noticed it too, since the level of difficulty seemed to us to have a decisive surge in the second half of the adventure, forcing us to repeat and complete the anonymous secondary missions to accumulate the materials necessary to customize our heroes and upgrade their equipment. This too soon proved to be a tedious exercise, based on menus that were not very intuitive and summarily explained: in practice, it is as if the developer had tried to implement at all costs a semblance of tactics in a game that had been thought, at least initially , as an unpretentious action. And that's not exactly what Valkyria Chronicles fans were looking for.", "date": "2017-06-27", "grade": "6.0"}
