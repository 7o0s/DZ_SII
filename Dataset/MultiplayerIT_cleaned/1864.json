{"name": "Robin Hood - La leggenda di Sherwood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/robin-hood-la-leggenda-di-sherwood.html", "text": "A hero in tights Entering this Robin Hood we can only pleasantly notice right away that our eyes will be treated with all respects. We start from the opening movie; I think I have rarely seen more beautiful ones. It may not be of Blizzard quality but it is still surprisingly beautiful and long enough. Nothing particularly original; Robin presents himself to the general public by saving a couple of Saxon commoners in difficulty in front of an unspecified group of Norman soldiers, inserting all the features of the case: surprise entrance, even more surprise exit from the scene, lightning-fast movements, deadly arrows accurate and so on. Could we have expected anything less? I do not believe. The dubbing and audio quality are also excellent, in any case. And here we are finally catapulted into the menus; these are similar to what you will find later in the game and in the actual action; nothing unattainable but certainly cared for, pleasant, simple and intuitive. The options present are very few but we can certainly postpone this. The story of good Robin (the quintessential example of Gidierresca's Chaotic Good) is very well known to all; in any case know that at the return of the crusades you will find your father passed away, your lands passed away too (in the hands of the king's brother) and your only hope to reach the faithful Godwin in that of Lincoln. Only that it won't be easy, as you can understand from the amount of soldiers around those lands. Thus begins 'Robin Hood, the Legend of Sherwood', a title that will allow you to immerse yourself in the part and in the tights of the famous bandit who steals from rich to give to the poor and that in the enterprise in question of money he will instead have to hold on to a large share, since he will need it for the ransom of his beloved King Richard the Lionheart. 40 missions set in the gloomy Sherwood Forest, den of good thieves, York, Lincoln, Leicester castles, ambushes and anything else you can think of with this setting. As we have already said in the preview and as you can easily guess, the graphic design of the title is of the highest level. The decision to develop in 2D and with a 'distant' vision has allowed the creation of absolutely spectacular backdrops, 'alive', full of details and visual pearls. Moving streams, beautifully 'animated' animals, lush countryside and a forest to take your breath away. Too bad that in the Close vision, indispensable for tactical reasons, the quality loses a bit of impact and ends up falling into the typical 'pixels', but from so close you can accept it. The sounds of the forest Audio question: here too we are close to excellence. The only criticism I feel is related to the great repetitiveness of the whole. 'Walking' along a particular section, it may happen that you come across beggars, guards or commoners who, of course, have personalized voices and sound effects. But if it should happen that we have to stay (perhaps hidden or waiting) in that place for a while their voice would really make us nauseous due to the continuous repetition of the exact same things. For the rest the voices are very beautiful and help to get into the atmosphere and I don't see any particular flaws even in the music of 'heart-beating' which changes pace according to the situation in which Robin or one of his trusted cronies is in that moment. Beautiful, definitely beautiful. Now we can only go on to examine the crucial aspect of such a title, or the AI (Artificial Intelligence for the less well-off) of the enemies, the real fulcrum of a title of this kind. Well, I'd say the test passed great. Practical example; our Robin sneaks up to a bush where 4 Norman soldiers are crowded a little further on. Once the bow has been stretched and an arrow has been shot, the soldiers become 3. The 3 in question, seeing their comrade fall to the ground, will first approach him and check what has happened, then they will look around for the culprit while exclaiming phrases (not really brilliant..but they are soldiers at the bottom, what the heck) like ~Hey, he doesn't move anymore..he's dead!~ or ~But who did it??~, until the probable identification of Robin and at that moment you can imagine how it will end.. all with the help of icons (exclamation or question mark) on the soldiers' heads, clear identifiers of the attitude at that given moment of the unit in question. In general, however, the enemy units will always respond in a more or less credible way, even in difficult situations such as in case of fog or at night (the locations are beautiful in those cases).And finally... Of course you won't/can't use only Robin of Lochsley but all the merry bunch of jokers; needless to repeat their well-known names. Know that obviously each of the 40 missions will have to be solved with the help of the (often crossed) skills of 1,2,3 or more 'merry-man' suitable for the occasion and that therefore cunning and sensible programming will pay much more than an indiscriminate and frontal attack. All with the presence of many goodies; scrolls left on the ground that will give you useful information on fundamental aspects of the game, skills and more. 'Npc' to interact with like beggars, who will give you fundamental information in exchange for hard cash, recoverable mostly from the corpses of enemies or from thefts, ambushes and so on. The environment is extremely interactive; you can even climb the ivy, hide from sight from enemies in any (or almost) house or cottage you find on your way and many other things. Everything will be seasoned with real pearls; for example in the initial mission (a kind of tutorial) to distract the guards inside the castle of Lincoln you will have to hit a target from afar thus making their commander believe that the soldiers in question have finally improved their shooting skills and sending them all to refectory for prize, thus leaving you free field in the square. You can stun the other guards (own skill) or attack them for all intents and purposes; the combat is done in a rather simple way. Mouse click and rotation of the same will be used to attack or parry you, attack from left or right or try some improbable number. Quite successful and effective, even if perhaps a little too simple. But on the other hand it will be one of the very few defects that you will find in this Robin Hood, a title of great visual and strategic effect. Nothing new under the sun, but a very hot soup with a great taste. What else are you waiting for? Lady Marian is not a damsel to be kept waiting too long! Welcome to Sherwood A few years ago Commandos opened a vein, you know. I don't invent any elements, but I merged them so well as to create a real-time action strategy so perfect in terms of playability, suspense, graphics and multimedia and above all the feeling of imminent danger that it was able to convey. It's an old story now; the title was very successful and soon a famous (or infamous) Data Disk was released of an impressive difficulty, but which if nothing else served to refresh the game while waiting for an imminent sequel. A few years passed and the time finally came for the Iberian Pyro Studios to present the second chapter of the Saga. It goes without saying that the beautiful title was one of the best-selling games of that year and the level of attention it had managed to attract was very high. Perhaps even too high given that, inevitably, a title similar in the theoretical and production intentions of the unknown Spellbound came out in the same period. We have already told what happened in the preview published a few months ago. In short, Desperados succeeded in the impossible mission of snatching a certain number of fans from the successful Commandos saga and the first comments that spoke of 'bad clone' were quickly replaced by others of a very different consideration. Here too nothing new, if not some small innovation related to the gameplay. Only a well-kept creation, spectacular graphics, total immersion and great involvement. Now it's finally time to see what the now famous German Spellboundians have been up to. I imagine without too much effort that the biggest problem they faced in the pre-production phase was that of finding a different, original and charismatic setting, perhaps linked to some fascinating legend. In a word, welcome to Sherwood my friends...", "date": "2002-12-23", "grade": null}
