Many interesting observations, some conscious and well-argued, others aimed only at capturing audiences or guaranteeing a vulgar return in terms of clicks or listeners. The story is old but at regular intervals it comes back into fashion, especially when the developers of a title do nothing to avoid drawing attention to themselves. The most recent example is that of Hatred, a shoot'em up that months ago was in the center of the cyclone due to its unprecedented and gratuitous violence, to the point of being canceled from Steam Greenlight, before returning online and being crippled in unanimous from the critics. Bringing a product based on very bloody mechanics to the market is not easy, in a case like the one we have mentioned it has proved to be a double-edged sword, but there are also many examples of works with rather racy contents that have achieved success precisely because of these characteristics. To try to go down this same path - not without exploiting some compromises - Pinokl Games also tried with the creation of Party Hard. Party Hard combines the killing spree of Hotline Miami with unique stealth tactics A compromise between Hatred and Hotline Miami? If, before dedicating himself to this project, the Ukrainian team only produced casual products intended for the mobile market and applications designed for social networks, Party Hard is instead aimed above all at old school players, offering an effective stealth approach and a decidedly above average. The qualities of this title had already been recognized before the release, on the occasion of the Indie Prizes held in Amsterdam last February, during which the production took home the Critic's Choice Awards. Coincidentally, among the developers of the independent scene who expressed positive comments there was also Jarosaw Zieliski, CEO of the Polish team that created Hatred. And here the circle seems to close, considering that Party Hard puts the player in the role of a heinous serial killer who at the turn of the millennium - and for reasons that will be learned in the course of history - has chosen to massacre the participants of numerous social parties located on all of America. But then, from Pinokl's point of view, what could have been the solutions useful to avoid attracting too much criticism? The first is the presence of a message, as pointed out by the leader of the study, Alexandr Potapenko. According to him, through the game, an attempt is made to convey the concept that killing innocents is not a good way to solve one's problems at all. Behind these carnage there is in fact a story, narrated by some cut-scenes that intersperse the gameplay and reconstruct the events at the same time as an interrogation in which a police officer, who has been on the killer's trail for a long time, is taking part. After the events that concerned Hatred, Potapenko himself did not hide his fear of seeing the project fail due to too many criticisms, nevertheless the very colorful and stylized graphic style - clearly of 8-bit derivation - places this work in a different light and allows it to be combined with Hotline Miami, from which it has clearly drawn chromatic and artistic inspirations but also some suggestions in terms of design. Pick up the phone, the killer is waiting for you Its own creators define Party Hard as a ~third person urban conflict simulator~, a definition which, moreover, seems to us to only partially outline the spirit of the game and its marked tactical component. The goal is precisely to crash the party on duty and successfully eliminate all the participants, taking care not to be captured by the police or shot down by any bouncers. To complete the task you need to get in tune with the surrounding environment, understand which parts of the map are most suitable for not being identified and resort to an approach as elusive as possible. Each level is visible in its entirety, through a classic top view that allows you to have the entire area under control. Although at the beginning the only melee weapon at one's disposal is the knife, there are also numerous environmental interactions to give us a hand in the crazy gesture, which can be activated to then give time to get away from the surroundings without arousing any suspicion . It is thus possible to tamper with electrical devices, place traps, start parked cars, or even poison cocktails and throw people out of windows. If necessary, it is also possible to use the contents of a briefcase, which will appear in random modesame at the beginning of some levels and will sometimes allow you to change clothes to no longer be identifiable, or to throw smoke bombs, place time bombs, get a sword and more. Often it will be necessary to hide the corpses in special places such as bins or manhole covers, in order to prevent other participants from raising the alarm. There are in fact two different ways to find the police forces between your feet: the first is for another guest to notice the presence of a body and go to the nearest telephone to call 911. In this case it will be sufficient to stay due distance from the sensitive area so as not to be put in the least bit of difficulty. The second, on the other hand, foresees that one is caught in the act and, in this eventuality, the reactions are manifold. It is possible to meet the irate guest who lashes out at us vehemently, the one who pisses himself off but does not act intelligently, isolating himself and thus becoming easy prey, and finally the hero of the moment who, despite knowing where the threat arrives, he decides to do the math and try to reach the receiver. Unlike Hotline Miami, the NPCs are not armed, so their resistance to the threat will in most cases be very small. The police forces for their part will intervene with increasing attention, making themselves increasingly difficult to evade. While on the first patrol it will be enough to run towards an exit connecting to a different point on the map to see the agent lift his heels to the cry of ~I'm too old for this shit!~, after many identifications none other than FBI agents will hesitate to arrive at the scene. At that point the skein will be much more complicated to unravel and the strategic variables less effective than usual. In addition to the graphic aspect, the top view and the tactical component, Party Hard reminded us of Hotline Miami also for the effectiveness of the soundtrack, which plays a very important role and contributes both to giving a fast pace and to entertaining. reducing the impact of the very serious actions that are being carried out to a minimum. The tones are psychedelic, akin to the disco music of the 90s, not without clear references to the soundtracks of arcade video games of yesteryear. Coming to the defects that we found during our test, it seems fair to highlight that the usable weapons could have been more varied, while some scenarios have a very similar structure to each other, which is repeated with minimal variations of an environmental nature. We also perceive some small basic inconsistencies, mostly due to the repeated stay at a party of people who have already seen dozens of murders and should leave at the speed of light, or due to the contrast between the seriousness of the intermezzo scenes and the strong dark humor imprint of the raids. However, details remain, net of an experience that amuses and keeps you glued to the screen without even realizing it. We feel the same way to make a note to the developers, who have chosen to indicate the selectable characters at the beginning of each mission as ~Heroes~: we don't want to appear moralistic, but it is also true that a slightly more consonant with the absurdity of the actions performed.", "date": "2015-08-28", "grade": "8.0"}
