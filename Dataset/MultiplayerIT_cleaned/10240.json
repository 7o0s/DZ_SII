By managing their resources in the best possible way, keeping the people at bay, using diplomacy towards other peoples and taking advantage of every useful opportunity to acquire some new territory. Ultimately, it's a winning strategy even when the playground is space, the setting is futuristic and we control the fate of an entire species that must confront eleven other rival races for dominance. Armada 2526, developed by Nitronium Games, stands as the ideal sequel to Armada 2525, an RTS developed in 1991 but never released. Its strengths lie above all in the space setting, which has been combined with a turn-based structure typical of titles such as Rome: Total War. Starting from a single planet, our goal is to colonize all the habitable worlds around us, increasing the global wealth of our system and at the same time making technological progress. The game offers us a simple tutorial to familiarize ourselves with the controls and achieve some simple objectives, then we can move on to the real campaign, choose the faction and start building an empire. Where no man has gone before The planet from which we start (the Earth, if we have chosen to lead the human race) has characteristics that we can control via the graphical interface, and which indicate its level of habitability, wealth, the presence of minerals that can be extracted from the soil , the population and the related mood. We have industries available for the construction of spaceships of various types, but the ones we need at the beginning are basically Arks (colonial ships), Corvettes (battleships) and possibly transport ships. Using the right click of the mouse, we can select another planet and define the fleet to send to explore it and, if possible, colonize it. In the event that the planet is uninhabited and the conditions for life exist, with a click we can establish our outpost there, transfer people there, create an economic system, and so on. To build an empire, of course, we have to repeat the same operation over and over again, respecting the requirements of the case (there are planets that cannot be inhabited due to climatic conditions, or that require a particular type of Ark to be founded there a colony). But what happens when we come into contact with another race? Depending on the type of encounter, we can decide to act with violence or to coexist peacefully. In reality, the second hypothesis is often necessary because we are usually at a lower technological and military level than our adversaries, but in practice we will be made to pay for coexistence through specific duties or requests. Each race is distinguished by a different character and characteristics, therefore there are the more violent ones and the milder ones, but in the end the best strategy is always to be patient, build a good fleet, take a few steps forward from the point from the point of view of production and therefore crashing anyone who stands between us and the conquest of the universe, always and in any case taking advantage of numerical superiority. Space battles There are various types of real-time strategy games, which adopt different combat systems. One element remains common among all, however: to win a battle, it is almost always necessary to present the appointment with a greater number of units than the enemy. From this point of view, Armada 2526 is no exception, indeed the choice of a ~semi-automatic~ mechanism that regulates the clashes makes numerical superiority even fundamental for victory. When our ships meet an enemy, we can opt between an automatic resolution (the combat is simulated instantly, and we are shown a simple box with the results) or control the troops firsthand, managing their movement and eventually coordinating their attacks within a very simplistic and limited context. Let's also say that this aspect of the game is very little taken care of, the spacecrafts respond to our inputs in a chaotic way and the consequence is that we will increasingly tend to resort to automatic collision, whatever the consequences. The technical realization of the game, in general, unfortunately appears mediocre, almost amateurish. In the first place there is the problem of the interface, which is far from practical in the arrangement of the various elements: using all the functions right away and correctly is frankly impossible, therefore at first it is necessary to resortre to the aids and understand well the organization of the controls. Secondly, the discreet workmanship of the star map alone is not enough to justify the lack of style and design that distinguish all the other elements. The representatives of the various races are unwatchable, with polygonal models that seem to come out of a time machine and short computer graphics films, all the same and equally ugly, which have the task of visually describing certain situations. There is some good music to support the action, but it ends up getting repetitive after a very short time and is still accompanied by effects that border on simplistic.", "date": "2010-01-20", "grade": "5.5"}
