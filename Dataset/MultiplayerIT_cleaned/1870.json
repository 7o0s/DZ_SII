{"name": "Ratchet & Clank", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ratchet-clank-2.html", "text": "Platform? shooter? Action? Ratchet and Clank, like any self-respecting duo, complement each other. If on the one hand Clank is a know-it-all, temperate and even a little ~loser~ robot, Ratchet is the classic shrewd, likeable and funny protagonist. In short, a strange couple. A necessary premise: we are not dealing with a classic 3d platformer. The game levels are filled with platforms of all types and there is no shortage of exploratory elements, but the funniest and most characteristic part of the game lies in the use of the many gadgets and the many weapons available to the dynamic duo. Classic elements therefore, flanked by an exaggerated amount of action. The aim of the game is essentially to recover infobots, or devices that reveal the position of new planets, corresponding to the various levels. Said like this, it would seem to be dealing with a classic exploratory game like there are already many, instead the Imsoniac title manages to amaze and keep you glued to the screen, by virtue of the exceptional variety of its missions and the presence of absolutely crazy gadgets, but we will talk about this later. Searches, travels and havoc! The development of the game unfortunately leaves the player with very limited freedom: the tasks to be performed are for the vast majority related to each other, and as you progress through the game you will find particular gadgets that will allow you to explore previously unreachable areas in the planets already visited. It actually boils down to the simple scheme: find the infobot, take the gadget, go back, explore the new area, find the new infobot, and so on. Nonetheless, between simple puzzles, complicated puzzles, end-of-level bosses, hoverboard races (a futuristic skateboard), exploration, devastation and more, the desire to see what will happen increases throughout the game, involving and intriguing the player, so much that you will hardly detach yourself from the TV. The question many of you are probably asking yourself is: ~What's so funny about Ratchet & Clank?~ The answer is very simple and explanatory: everything! The futuristic setting that characterizes the game makes the levels apparently all a bit similar to each other, but the design of the areas and their population are on the contrary very accurate and varied, and every time it will seem to you that the missions are really different from each other. The strong point of the game, however, are the already mentioned gadgets. Thanks to the exploration and killing of enemies, we will be able to collect bolts (bolts) which are nothing more than the currency accepted in all the gadgetron points of sale present in the game, and which will then be used to purchase a whole series of more or less conventional. Starting from the blaster, a classic old-fashioned shooter pistol, Ratchet will have a truly enviable arsenal at his disposal during the game: bazookas, weapons that suck up enemies and then use them as ammunition, flamethrowers and many, many others (about thirty base, as well as those that will be unlocked by replaying the game from scratch) that I prefer not to reveal so as not to spoil the surprise, just know that I have not mentioned the best and funniest ones. During your raids with Ratchet, Clank will be stuck on your shoulders, transforming into different jetpacks over the course of the game. What clashes and breaks the rhythm of the game are the sections in which you will only control the robot, due to its too limited possibilities. In any case, fear not, because almost all of the game will see you as Ratchet. Another aspect that will not fail to amuse the general public are the videos, linked mostly to the discovery of the infobots: fun, ingenious and at the same time functional to the plot of the game and to the characterization of the secondary characters, one of all the unmissable Captain qwark. A deadly mix of sympathy, devastation and action combined with reflective elements and some more classic ones make this game an experience suitable for all types of gamers, also thanks to a medium-low level of challenge that will not discourage anyone. The technique The Insomniac title amazes right away: the amount of objects present on the screen at the same time is truly remarkable as is the impeccable fluidity, constant on 50 frames per second except for very rare slowdowns (in total I counted about ten in several hours of play). The chromatic choices are excellent, something to complain about instead you could have on the graphic design of Ratchet, although very well done on a technical level, he is a character who is not visually convincing, fortunately where the artistic talents of the designers do not arrive, an exceptional characterization and evolution of the character arrives that allows us to overcome this flaw. The textures are the sore point of this production: average, sometimes quite flat. The management of the camera is fair, something more could have been done but overall the behavior is good. Another really nice aspect is the sound localization: the game is entirely spoken in Italian and cut scenes, tutorials and so on are played in an excellent way. The techno-like music that will accompany you during the game is rather anonymous. The controls are simple and pressing the start button offers to better control all our gadgets, the maps of the various levels and an excellent online help. There is a selector for 60hz, however given the freeze problems that occur when viewing movies, the advice is to play in 50hz mode which offers the same fluidity and speed of play. Comment Ratchet & Clank is really a very entertaining game, a meeting point of various genres and certainly one of the best videogame productions of 2002, to the point that every Playstation 2 owner should seriously consider buying it, obviously compatibly with their own tastes. The duration of the game is about 15 hours but replayability, thanks to the possibility of unlocking a sea of goodies and the presence of a new set of fantastic gadgets to be purchased with secret golden bolts, is guaranteed. To complete it 100% an average savvy player should take about 25 hours, not bad. Maybe it won't be a masterpiece, but it sure is the best exponent of the genre on Ps2. Pros + Fun for the duration of the game + Gadgets and crazy story + Great game variety and excellent technical realization Cons - Clank sections are monotonous and break the rhythm - subdued textures - Musical accompaniment can be improved After the purple dragon, Ratchet and Clank make their debut in the world of video games, the first strange anthropomorphic animal and the second intelligent robot. On the other hand, the role of the bad guy on duty is this time worn by President Drek who, worried about the environmental conditions of his planet, reduced to a toxic waste dump, has decided to build a new perfect habitat for his fellow citizens, stealing the best parts of the planets of the solar system, causing them to subsequently disintegrate due to changed physical conditions. The task of Ratchet and Clank, led by the player, will be to neutralize this plan. Will our heroes succeed in the arduous undertaking?", "date": "2002-12-20", "grade": null}
