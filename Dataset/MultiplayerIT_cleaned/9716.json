Ubisoft's first-person shooter with strategic elements has always gained public acceptance on any platform thanks to the plots inspired by those created by the American writer and screenwriter Tom Clancy, famous above all for his spy novels which even led to coining a new term for his literary genre, the techno-thriller. And to the introduction and enhancement, in the first episodes, of those tactical elements that have practically always been absent in the genre. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Predator, the first title of the series on the PlayStation Portable, refers precisely to the first episodes, thus focusing on strategy at the expense of more immediate action. The plot of the game is, as often happens in these productions, a cross between real facts and political fiction: the imaginary and now famous team of American special departments called Ghost is in the jungle of Sri Lanka to prepare the way for the invasion of forces which will take place within seventy-two hours and to hunt down the criminals who committed a massacre aboard a civilian ship and who the CIA seems to have identified as a group of extremists whose headquarters and training ground are near of a village right in the island state mentioned above. But the truth is not always as it appears... Imminent danger The game comes with a third-person view and the camera positioned behind the protagonist who is surrounded in every situation by two other team members almost always controlled by the CPU (you can play cooperatively on a local network with two other players) with both tactical and healing support duties (a wounded soldier can be rescued and rescued by other comrades). Each of the ~ghosts~ has its own characteristics such as name, statistics and specific training in some military field (shooter, sapper...). However, at any time it is possible to switch from one's character to a companion simply by pressing the triangle button, otherwise, leaving their management to the game's artificial intelligence as mentioned, orders can be given to him using the circle button, establishing among other things if we follow them without them being noticed or in a more brazen way, visible and ready to fire on everything that moves. The AI of the men of the team proves to be quite good in these cases, with the support Ghosts taking cover when attacked or looking for a valid position to take down the terrorists undisturbed, while the same cannot be said of the opponents. In fact, they are rather limited in their behavior and often ignore the presence of soldiers a few meters from them even if not camouflaged, they run towards the bullets during the shootings or act in a rambling way by opening fire from improbable positions ignoring even the obstacles. Obviously this does not mean that it is easy to eliminate them or complete the various military operations that will involve them. All in all, the enemy still moves in large numbers on terrain congenial to him, he knows where to hide and when to attack. It can be anywhere and anyone, between crowded markets or hidden among the inhabitants of a village. But it would have been better to have counter terrorists who were awake rather than senile. Search and destroy Speaking of the game structure Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Predator provides a series of missions that can be tackled in random order with actions that take place within villages and rural areas with the aim of eliminating the terrorists present there and then look for any allies among the population. Also for this reason you have to be very careful when performing an action, planning every move in the best possible way: in the game there is a reputation system linked to civilians so killing too many of them, even if by mistake, will mean having no information from the survivors or support from no gender. And if it is true that exploiting the environment, the tactical map and acting by surprise are among the fundamental rules for a good Ghost, it is also true that without the confidential information obtainable from the local population, the intrinsic difficulty of each attack increases exponentially. Each mission is organized so that the gamer can act freely, thanks to rather large maps that allow an adequate analysis of the surrounding terrain and the disposition of the enemies, planning whether to circumvent a group of terrorists or bring it down with direct action. Forget the furious shootings, the Rambo-like assaults with white weapons: even if this is possible and necessary in some cases, it is better to actcunning, taking advantage of all the material with which the ~ghosts~ are equipped. As tradition for this series, there is no shortage of more or less futuristic technology: air support, motion sensors, prototypes of new weapons and droids. The latter almost represent a mini-game in itself as you have to move them between enemies without being noticed, taking advantage of their small shape and remote-controlled car appearance, in order to identify the position of the opponents and report it on the team map. Curiosity A code is available within the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Predator product to unlock some special content in the Tom Clancy's HAWX 2 game. By entering this code in the aerial warfare simulator, in fact, you can get the special Ghost Recon pack which includes a exclusive skin and a new weapon pack for the Mirage F1. In the jungle It is in these situations that, in our opinion, the lack of a feature that would have further embellished the product making it more complete is felt: the possibility of hitting the enemy from behind. Consistent with the type of game and with the missions you face, being able to kill a terrorist by grabbing him from behind in silence wouldn't have been bad. Indeed, it probably would have given greater depth to the gameplay itself. Another flaw, but smaller since in any case you don't miss it so much, is the impossibility of jumping with your character. Once you have completed a mission, gaining experience in the field, you will be able to customize and upgrade your men while also having access, based on the result achieved, to new weapons, equipment or aesthetic elements. Speaking of aesthetics, while presenting a globally nice graphic in its overall vision, with discreet polygonal models for the protagonists and a good lighting system, the product appears unfinished in many aspects. The scenarios are not very detailed, the enemies as well, some of them are even animated poorly and in general poorly defined textures dominate the scene in all levels. All compounded by the total lack of antialiasing. Despite all this, the absurd game occasionally manages to snap in the most chaotic scenes. Instead, the audio sector is better with good background effects that faithfully reproduce the typical sounds both of environments rich in vegetation such as forests (animals, wind, movement of the grass, footsteps), and of furious shootings. The dubbing, in English (but there are subtitles in Italian) is good, like the music, taken entirely from the previous chapters of the series.", "date": "2010-10-20", "grade": "6.3"}
