{"name": "Dear Esther", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dear-esther-la-recensione-su-ios.html", "text": "It sounds a bit strange but republishing this title now on mobile platforms, seven years after its first release (11 from the initial one as a mod) and with all the changes that have taken place in the gaming landscape - strongly helped by its own existence - looks like doing him a disservice, as we see in this review of Dear Esther on iOS. On the one hand we would like to say that, like certain great works of art, this title by TheChineseRoom is substantially eternal and capable of withstanding any test of time, on the other it is easy to realize that his way of presenting himself certainly made more sense a dozen years ago than now. Ironically, this downsizing takes place largely thanks to the proliferation of that hybrid genre that Dear Esther helped to give birth and evolve, presenting itself to the public with an impact that, at the time, was disruptive and outside all the imposed schemes from the gaming tradition. For those unfamiliar with it, the title in question was born way back in 2007 as a mod based on Source Engine by Dan Pinchbeck, becoming a real videogame product a few years later thanks to funding from the Indie Fund and the addition of Robert Briscoe to enrich the aesthetics on the artistic front and Jessica Curry for the musical accompaniment. A fascinating and seminal work came out of it, having in fact founded what can be considered in all respects an official sub-genre of adventures, today usually defined as ~walking simulator~, accepting a label not without a certain irony which was originally buckled with a certain disdain. Like all works that undermine the canons imposed by the logic of genre and use of media and artistic expressions, the reception was controversial but the first reaction to Dear Esther was above all one of amazement, faced with that perfect combination of settings to be explored , the musical accompaniment and the fragmented narrative base, whose quality of writing had very few precedents. To see how the perception of a game of this kind can change based on the historical period, however, it is enough to see how the evaluations were already decidedly colder about five years later, at the time of the console release, when the genre of narrative adventures already counted several high caliber exponents. It may be a somewhat prosaic point of view, but after trying titles capable of playing with the rules of video games and storytelling, achieving expressive results of great impact such as Gone Home, Oxenfree, Firewatch, Soma, The Stanley Parable and others, among which the subsequent games of TheChineseRoom themselves, returning to Dear Esther or living it now for the first time can bring out the limits of this experience more, which however deserves great respect and still retains its expressive power. The places of the soul Dear Esther has forcefully renewed the discussion on the very definition of a video game, precisely because of its push to explore its boundaries, presenting itself as a work capable of bending the standard rules of the medium to allow the staging of a story according to a vision particular of the authors. The interaction is limited to the maximum, allowing only to move to explore, through a subjective view, the wonderful sceneries of a mysterious island that seems totally uninhabited, listening to a narrator who tells a fragmented story in the form of letters, often apparently without head nor tail. Such an elementary form of interaction has the express purpose of creating a connection between the atmosphere of the settings and the fragmented, twisted and smoky narration but capable of stimulating emotions even in an unconscious way, activating the receptive synapses that push one to enter those environments and let yourself be carried away. Dear Esther's lyric is hermetic but uses the combination of images and text to create a strong connection with the player, who directly experiences the protagonist's melancholy and desperate journey as he wanders around the island. The uncoordinated story of a man who experiences the drama of abandonment, calling into question memories and figures of the past to deal with the pain, gradually takes on meaning and pushes us to get to the bottom of it to understand everything, even if in the end it remains open to different interpretations which can lead to reliving it several times to fully understand it (at least as much as possible), also considering that it lasts less than two hours. The interactive component of the ~game~ is substantially entrusted to this work of identification and decoding, which dissociates itself from total passivity with this narrative solution, leaving the player the possibilityability to modify the listening/reading times by focusing on the settings and contemplating the panoramas which are the visual extension of the story. It's something much simpler and more basic than what other adventures of this type have done since and this is precisely the main problem of Dear Esther, besides the fact that it loses some of its original immersive power on the screens of mobile platforms. For the rest, the game corresponds precisely to the Landmark Edition released on consoles after the original, with the addition of the commentary and the possibility of selecting the settings to explore once unlocked, with no further novelties applied beyond an excellent job of conversion.", "date": "2019-10-09", "grade": "7.5"}
