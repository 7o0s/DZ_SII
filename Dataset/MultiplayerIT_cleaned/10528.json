The desirable and appreciable series of subsequent DLCs has begun to materialize in these days, with the first of the three packages planned to expand the original product; subtitled Demons of the Badlands, contrary to what is indicated by the trend of the gaming market, does not focus on the multiplayer component, but instead focuses on the main story by expanding the story and offering further details on the plot. An explosive game In the Red Faction: Guerrilla timeline, this expansion takes place a few years before the events of the main game, and therefore the protagonist is also different. This time it is in fact a woman, named Samanya, who is part of the Marauders rebel group; the setting is also new, the Mariner Valley, unfortunately however completely disconnected from the main area and therefore quite limited, just as some vehicles and weapons available are unpublished. It is evident that, although Demons of the Badlands actually represents a prequel at a narrative level, within the game economy it is an adventure to be played once the original title is completed; this is because the character of Samanya is already particularly developed with regard to the weapons available and the number of explosive charges it can carry, thus eliminating the growth factor experienced instead in the role of Alec Mason. The result is that this expansion does not constitute a further and higher level of challenge for Red Faction veterans, but on the contrary is positioned as a kind of more fun, immediate and all in all accessible toy with which to offer a massive dose of destruction explosive to those who have simply not had enough. Furthermore, weapons and objects are no longer carefully unlocked by spending the points earned, but on the contrary they are simply added to the player's availability as the story progresses. The plot unfolds through three main missions, starting with the liberation of Samanya's sister held captive by the EDF; there is obviously a handful of secondary objectives, exactly as those who have had the opportunity to play Guerrilla know well, which are resolved in the usual amusing but now repetitive categories of saving hostages, demolishing certain objectives and transporting materials with the Martian means of locomotion . Little new with regard to the aesthetic component, which while modifying some details such as the architecture of the structures and - as mentioned - the vehicles and little else, still remains absolutely close to what was seen in Guerrilla from every point of view.", "date": "2009-09-16", "grade": "8.0"}
