{"name": "Shadow Hearts: Covenant", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-hearts-covenant.html", "text": "The Great War Contrary to what happens for other more famous sagas, see the various Final Fantasy, we are faced in this case with a true sequel, and the number ~two~ that distinguishes, at least for the Japanese and American market, this Covenant does not have a function let's say fictitious, that is suitable to indicate the simple succession of episodes without any narrative connection between them, but it serves precisely to indicate a real continuation of the first episode. Shadow Hearts Covenant is set a few years after the events narrated in the first chapter of the saga, which had seen, in its conclusion, Yuri's victory over Albert Simon and the terrifying divinity he evoked, and Alice's momentary rescue. In a Europe devastated by the outbreak of the First World War, the German invasion troops led by lieutenant Karin Koenig, after having penetrated into France, in their progress within the transalpine territory occupy the quiet town of Domremy, Alice's birthplace, where Yuri had decided to move in with the unfortunate young woman. A strange legend hovers over the French town which tells of a mysterious creature that appears at night near the town. Soon the Kaiser's soldiers understand that this legend actually has more than a foundation since they will collide and will be completely destroyed by an anthropomorphic demon inside the local church. Not even the intervention of an exorcist sent by the Vatican, Nicholai, manages to stop the fury of the unusual enemy. Of course, the rest of the story will be up to you to find out by playing this SHC. Battle System From the gameplay point of view, the game offers what we usually see in any good self-respecting RPG: large areas to explore, dungeons, forests, cities to visit and in which to interact with the inhabitants to discover some side-quests or to collect useful information or even enhance our characters in the various shops scattered throughout the streets of the various urban agglomerations. Conversely, the same cannot be said for the combat system. In fact, unlike the latest themed productions, such as Star Ocean 3, which provide for clashes with enemies in real-time, in SHC the battles take place with the old but always loved turn-based system, the same already appreciated in the previous chapter, but more evolved and perfected, even if the ~canonical~ order which provides for alternating player-monster actions is here replaced by a more interesting ~turn-system~ which provides for specific movements for each creature participating in the battle, similar to what we have seen in Phantom Brave by Nippon Ichi. In short, enemies and allies will act according to their respective speed of action and not by alternating first one group and then the other. Furthermore, the arrangement of our characters on the battlefield has its own significant importance as it allows us to create terrifying combos depending on how they will be positioned. And speaking of special attacks: their Level-Up will no longer be determined by the usual number of battles won, but rather by the type of objects available to the character who must carry them out. These special objects can be recovered around the various levels or be obtained at the end of some quests. A Ring to strike them... These items can also modify some aspects of the so-called Judgment Ring, which once again is the real fulcrum of the Shadow Hearts Battle System, the key element through which to build our attacks and beyond. As the term itself suggests, it is none other than a ring present on the screen during the fights, characterized by a series of colored sectors that identify the various types of action that our character can perform. At its end it has a red zone dedicated to more powerful attacks. This works a bit like the Wheel of Fortune or the loading system of some golf games: you have to make the indicator stop at the point of the ring within which the ~move~ that we want our Pg to make is enclosed. In this sense, therefore, a good choice of timing in pressing the appropriate button is fundamental. The dimensions of these areas can be increased to facilitate the execution of the commands, as mentioned, with the discovery of some objects (and this consists of the enhancement of the Judment Ring we mentioned a moment ago). This method for determining attacks, in our opinion, is also excellent because it constantly focuses the gamer's attention on the combat itself, without allowing the monotony or mechanicalness of certain attack commands typical of other RPGs to take over, unless that you do not choose to use the automatic modepresent among the options. Like the characters, the Ring can also be affected by some status ailments. Therefore, for example, it may happen that you see him disappear from view just before making an attack choice and then entrust yourself to the help of Lady Luck to complete an action. The growth of the characters takes place in a somewhat anomalous way compared to any other J-RPG. First of all, the distribution of EXP points seems very clever to us. Only four available party members can be deployed during battles. However, once the fight ends, the EXP points will be equally divided even with those who did not actively participate in the fight. In practice, those who remained in the rear will on average have half the points that will go to the main team instead. In this way when in the more advanced stages of the game the characters have to be alternated, perhaps in an important side-quest in which the specific presence of Gepetto rather than Ouka is required, just to give a concrete example, we will not end up with little Pg balanced, perhaps too developed some, little or nothing others, effectively allowing an easier upgrade for everyone. This is not limited only to the increase of one's skills through the points earned in battle, but is also determined by the type of object equipped by our party members. In fact, each character can increase their physical attack skills even with the discovery of some objects which then determine a general enhancement. Magic System Compared to the old Shadow Hearts, however, the Magic System is the technical aspect that has undergone the most radical changes. Here too, instead of presenting us with characters with their own abilities to be strengthened and upgraded through the continuous use of the various spells, in Covenant we find a new element of growth and learning of these magical powers, the so-called Crests, objects identifiable as books of spells which contain particular spells capable of giving the character to whom new skills are assigned, such as ~Cure~, ~Slow~ or special Attack Powers, etc., all skills that in other role-playing games are generally the default for the various PCs . Obviously Yuri, who possesses the power of Fusion (he can transform up to twenty types of creatures), is excluded from this type of magical development. The rest of the troop, however, can be customized as we please. There are an infinite number of these elements, so it becomes essential to calmly plan the magical evolution of the individual elements of our party. That's not to say that our virtual heroes don't have any intrinsic characteristics that distinguish them, by default, from one another. We have said about Yuri and his transformations, but the other characters also have certain abilities of their own, such as Anastasia who has the special ability to be able to ~see~ the information on the enemy's HP/MP, or Lucia, who thanks to her tarot cards can attack opponents with a very personal devastating weapon, assisted in this sense by his particular affinity with some elements such as darkness. In the light of what has been described up to now, it seems quite clear how much this title can offer to the J-RPG enthusiast thanks to the infinite opportunities for growth of their characters. A visual show One of the negative causes that influenced the lack of attractiveness of the first episode of Shadow Hearts in the eyes of most J-RPG fans was undoubtedly the poor graphic quality offered by that game, more from Psx than from Ps2 (but we explained why in the introductory paragraph of this article). This time, however, the Aruzes have done things right in that regard. Starting with the locations. The small areas of the previous episode of the saga have been replaced by much larger locations always made with the pre-rendering technique, but thanks to the splendid textures that cover the 3D-like structures, everything appears to the eye as something qualitatively fulfilling. Just look, for example, at the attention given to the detailed graphics of the Gothic buildings, very well done, complete with atmospheric light effects that filter through the windows and glass windows creating splendid shadow effects. Ditto for the dungeons or forests that we will find ourselves exploring. The character design appears to be spot on. The three-dimensional models of the characters have an excellent aesthetic characterization and are made with a fair number of polygons. Even on them the touches of class are wasted: details such as the gloves with religious representations of Karin or the pressed costume of Yuri are just aexample of the excellent work done by the Aruze artists. But perhaps the qualitative apex is reached in the representation of some types of magic, absolutely spectacular, and in the filmed interludes made with the same graphics as the game where it is possible to admire the facial animations and the beauty of the various characters. In short, to conclude, the graphics fully do their duty, creating the right visual atmosphere and totally immersing the gamer in a universe populated by creatures of the night. In this supported by a respectable audio sector (and it could not be otherwise since the soundtrack was created by the duo Yoshitaka Hirota / Yasunori Mitsuda, already authors of the music of the first Shadow Hearts) which offers our ears a truly original soundtrack which mixes various musical genres with each other, with a good assortment ranging from pure gothic to a sort of techno-horror. Another positive note is the dubbing of the characters present in the aforementioned intermediate scenes: simply one of the best ever heard in a video game. Conclusions The year that has just ended was conditioned by ups and downs in the production of Japanese role-playing games. What has just begun, however, seems to have started off on the right foot thanks to Shadow Hearts: Covenant, a title which, while remaining within a certain errepigistic tradition, presents a unique gameplay of its kind and a general quality of absolute value. In our opinion, the Aruze Team game was the best RPG of 2004, and will be one of the best of the new year, capable of competing on equal terms with future masterpieces such as Final Fantasy XII. Pros: Technically satisfying. Atmosphere, storyline and Oscar-winning Battle System. Great longevity. Cons: Lack of localization in our language. In the current galaxy of Japanese RPGs, the Shadow Heart series is now without a doubt one of the most interesting. Indeed, after the release of this second episode that fills the (technical) gaps of its predecessor, rediscovered by many thanks to Covenant, the saga that began way back in 2001 by the Aruze Team is considered by many as one of the greatest exponents of the genre, also due to a whole series of details that in fact make this series unique (the third episode seems to be already in the works) in the eyes of the most demanding gamers, as we will be able to deepen in the course of our article. First of all the setting: contrary to almost all the rest of the themed productions, here we are faced with a historical setting in Europe at the beginning of the century, before the outbreak of the Great War (Shadow Hearts) and during (Covenant), with a which skilfully intersects with the events of that world tragedy, even if obviously seasoned with dark-gothic fantastic elements. Then its main characters, atypical for a Japanese-style role-playing game, and finally a very interesting game system based on the so-called ~Ring of Destiny~, all key elements that explain why, for example, the first chapter, in spite of a not excellent technique, probably due to the fact that the game was designed for the Playstation and only later diverted to Ps2, it was one of the most loved of the genre, even if only by a small circle of enthusiasts. SH was snubbed by the general European public, dazzled by the beauty of a similar title released in that period, namely Final Fantasy X. However, strengthened by the consent of that small circle of users who were able to appreciate its qualities, and eager to present a product in line with the most famous 128Bit productions, having taken note of the ~mistakes~, let's call them that, of the past, the Aruzes (the same authors of the interesting Koudelka for Psx), rolled up their sleeves and after three years have returned to the fray with this Covenant, a title that risks literally beating the competition and carving out a well-deserved space in the heart of every good Rpg-gamer.", "date": "2005-02-11", "grade": null}
