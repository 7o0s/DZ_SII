You can play outdoors or indoors, possibly in a large place. One player counts for a predetermined time on the so-called den (usually a wall), while the others look for hiding places. Once the count is over, the finder starts wandering in search of the hidden players. His goal is to find them and then run to touch the den, so as to capture them. The others, on the other hand, have to wait for the right moment to come out of hiding and run towards the den, to win. If desired, they can also touch captured players to free them. There are variations, but in general the rules used are the same everywhere. Now let's change the game. Do you know the catch (or tag)? It's even easier than hide and seek. It is always played in a relatively large area and sees one player trying to catch the others by anticipating their moves. What do two children's games have to do with Dead by Daylight? Let's put it this way: merge hide and seek with tag, decorate everything with the tones of a splatter horror film and you will have a fairly precise idea of how the Behavior Digital Inc. title works, a permanent presence in the Steam top 10 for a few days , despite having come almost out of nowhere. But let's not rush too much and try to understand more precisely what we are talking about. Remaining well hidden, we have reviewed Dead by Daylight: let's find out, but without exposing ourselves too much Victims and executioner Dead by Daylight is not introduced by a significant storyline. It is a four-on-one multiplayer game in which one player plays a killer and the other four victims who must manage to escape. At the beginning of each game, the killer does not know where the four survivors are and must wander around in search of them, scouring the places where they might be hiding. To flush them out, he must pay particular attention to the noises they can produce, such as the explosion of a generator they are trying to reactivate, or the cry of crows that fly away when they are annoyed by the presence of a survivor. After finding them, the killer must be able to stun them with his weapons: a first shot will wound them, weakening them, while a second will throw them to the ground leaving them at his mercy. Once a Survivor has landed, the Killer must grab them and ram them into one of the butcher hooks found throughout the maps. At this point he just has to wait for the appearance of some demonic claws that will drag the victims into the darkness after having mortally pierced them for the last time. The survivors for their part must obviously avoid being found by the killer, being careful not to generate annoying noises and leave visible traces. For example, it is better to run only when being chased, because doing so leaves trails on the ground that reveal your position. The objective of the survivors, identical in each map, is to find and activate four electric generators and then flee from the exits that will open. The activation of the generators is not an automatic operation and carries risks. Meanwhile, it requires time, which can be shortened by collaborating with others. The developers have found a sneaky and effective way to make this mechanic interesting. When interacting with a generator, a bar appears at the bottom of the screen indicating the status of the repair. From time to time, at random intervals, you may need to press the spacebar with a certain timing, to avoid causing crashes. In case of failure, not only does the time needed to repair the machine increase, but a small explosion is produced which, as we said above, can attract the killer's attention. In addition, the player playing the brute always knows where all the generators are, which are where he concentrates his efforts to find victims. Ichnombente Darkness Obviously the most interesting mechanics are those concerning the ~social interactions~ between the killer and the players. The description of the basic mechanics should have made you understand that playing the role of survivors you spend a lot of time hidden crawling in the dark, always attentive to any sign that indicates the presence of the killer, first of all the sound of his heartbeat which when is audible indicates its proximity. Once discovered, a survivor has several chances to escape. Obviously he has to run away, but if he wants he can also look for passages that slow down the pursuer (the killer is very slow in overcoming windows or barriers), or hiding places where to slip, hoping to go unnoticed. There are also objects that help in thesurvival, such as the flashlight, which can be used to annoy the killer, or the medkit, useful for healing after taking a hit. However the substance is that it is always better not to be seen and practice in the repair of generators. Of course, when a player is caught and used like a beef steak, the others can try to save him by detaching him from the hook, but it is a difficult operation, often thwarted by the killer himself who tries to anticipate the players' saves by giving them real ambushes. At the end of each match, regardless of the result, blood points are awarded, in variable quantities depending on how one behaved on the field. Blood can be spent to purchase skills from a web pattern. Once a scheme is exhausted, i.e. you have bought all the skills, you level up and a new one appears with different skills. Each of the four survivors has their own specific skills, as well as the three types of killers. Skills are not shared between characters, who must be managed individually instead. Repetitiveness The gameplay of Dead by Daylight is interesting and in many ways original, although it is not the first game to propose the formula immortal enemy against sacrificial sheep that must survive him. The work done by the development team to balance everything is remarkable, despite the emergence of some flaws after the arrival on the market: for example, the Wraith really seems to be the strongest assassin, thanks to its ability to become semi-invisible . However, these are problems that will surely be resolved with future updates, given that the development team has promised continued support for the game, with new content (some free, some paid) and constant revisions of the gameplay. At present the biggest flaw of Dead by Daylight is the repetitiveness. Of course, the maps are well done and offer a good variety, presenting environments typical of horror films: there's the classic rural house, there's a creepy junkyard and so on. Unfortunately they are few. The same goes for the characters too: the survivors are differentiated, but in the end, using them you always do the same things (even rightly so, since it's not a shooter); assassins offer more variety, but soon you tend to use only the one that gives the most advantages (the aforementioned Wraith). To this it must be added that there is only one modality, without variations of any kind. In short, a few hours of play are enough to experience everything that can be experienced and, if you are not captured by the gameplay, you end up abandoning Dead by Daylight without too many remorse. Finally, there are problems with accessing matches: there is no server browser and private matches cannot be organised. The result is extreme difficulty playing with friends, with players jumping from one lobby to another trying to find them, thus lengthening the waiting times of the others (if all the survivors are not there, you can't start playing) . Fortunately, the game is very stable and during our tests there were no connectivity problems (lag, high ping and so on).", "date": "2016-06-21", "grade": "7.8"}
