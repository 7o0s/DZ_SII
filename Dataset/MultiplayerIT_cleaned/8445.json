{"name": "WWE 2K22", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-2k22-recensione.html", "text": "We were waiting with some anxiety to be able to get our hands on WWE 2K22: as fans of wrestling and wrestling games, we have observed the evolution of a franchise that has probably been carried on for too long by the same people, who, however, had lost contact along the way with what makes a similar product fun. A boundless repertoire of moves and an enormous amount of modalities make very little sense when the movements and combat dynamics are slow, wooden, frustrating in their determination to represent this sport entertainment more like a painstaking, cumbersome simulation than anything more akin to a fighting game. Something funny, indeed. WWE 2K20, despite all its enormous problems, had a great merit: making sure that the franchise was finally questioned, rethought in its deepest mechanisms. Were the new series coordinator and the Visual Concepts guys able to relaunch the brand as we hoped? Partly yes, partly no: we explain why in the WWE 2K22 review. Gameplay WWE 2K22, Ultimate Warrior greets the audience Let's start with the positives: the gameplay of WWE 2K22 is actually improved compared to previous editions. One could maliciously say that it would have been difficult to do worse, but it must also be recognized that it is not easy to balance an experience of this type, making it immediate and engaging while maintaining a minimum of variety. Once in the ring, our aim is in fact that of inflicting a sufficient amount of damage to our opponent for it to be possible to pin him for a count of three; but how to achieve this goal? The developers have begun to rethink the experience from the controls, which are now much more immediate. Yes, it's true, it doesn't make much sense to assign the heavy attack to the A button when practically every action game for decades has used Y, but otherwise we're here: X for the fast attack, A as mentioned for the heavy one, B for make the grip, Y for instant counterattack: the function that was previously entrusted to the triggers. Having grabbed the opponent, we will be able to use X and A in combination with the left stick to perform various moves, or press B again to throw him against the ropes. 'is doubtful. However, some perplexities remain about the implementation of the block (Y held down), which in a wrestling game in which grappling counts above all does not have this great utility; and dodges, which can actually benefit us but which we will inevitably end up ignoring in favor of a more traditional approach. Amazon offer WWE 2K22 (Deluxe Edition) - - PlayStation 4 99.98 See Offer There is also a new reversal, which is performed by pressing X, A or B after they have grabbed us: if the button is the same as our opponent's, the counterattack will succeed. Furthermore, it was thought to limit the frustrating moments of blocking down by making sure that one can get up instantly by consuming one of the three indicators for the specials. Even the hateful timing-based minigames (freeing yourself from a submission hold, exiting the pin) have been replaced by the good old button mashing: that's good. To this system are added the QTE-based comebacks, very nice and simple to perform, and an intelligent system that gives the right value to the finishers, making these moves capable of closing the match when performed when the opponent is in difficulty: an excellent solution for reproducing the dynamics of WWE matches more faithfully, here too as opposed to an approach that previously failed on this front, thwarting our efforts. WWE 2K22, Brock Lesnar hesitates to enter the ring with Roman Reigns The action is faster thanks to the almost instantaneous activation of certain manoeuvres, see the running attacks, but some uncertainties remain on the front of collisions, interactions and artificial intelligence, which manifest themselves very clearly during the encounters of couple: our teammates ~stumble~ over the referee and so the continuous interference on the pin makes it impossible to close the match, unless all opponents are annihilated. In short, the new formula represents a step forward but still needs a quite a lot of work and during the meetings one often gets the feeling that the experience is still linked to the old counter system, only with different buttons and some variations on the theme which, however, struggles to find an appropriate place within the gameplay . modality WWE 2K22, the first match of the Showcase mode with Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero The main screen of WWE 2K22 allows you to access six different modes, none of which is new. The highlight of the offer, if we want to define it that way, is the Showcase dedicated to Rey Mysterio's career: a total of only twelve matches that however span a large period of time, from the beginning in 1997 in WCW to the most representative matches of 2020. Introduced and commented by Mysterio himself, the performances boast a remarkable scenographic factor, given that every few in-game graphics give way to the real video, to underline the extraordinary visual fidelity of the game (we'll get to that later). Unfortunately, however, the meetings are punctuated by a long list of mandatory actions that must be performed in order to move forward, with the result of a fragmented and frustrating experience, in which one often also collides with the shortcomings relating to collisions and the artificial intelligence of which we have already spoken. WWE 2K22, ~Macho Man~ Randy Savage is about to perform his iconic elbow drop on Hulk Hogan The Exhibition allows you to create single matches of any type, from normal one-on-one matches to the Royal Rumble, from handicap matches to Fatal 4-Ways: stipulations already seen in the past in the series, nothing new here either, but with the over 160 characters available (which include over thirty wrestlers fired in recent months, it must be said) are undoubtedly the most immediate and fun content, with which to give life to dream matches between legends of the past or more recent feuds between superstars of the WWE. The most substantial modes in terms of content are Universe, that is the closest thing to a traditional career mode, with the possibility this time of impersonating a single wrestler or of taking part in all the matches of each event; and Il Mio GM, which re-proposes its managerial formula after several years. Having chosen a general manager, we will have to obtain better results than our direct competitor and to do so we will need to focus on big names, special stipulations and other mechanisms, although some prerogatives for success appear questionable: it is the popularity of the wrestlers and not the difference category to produce ratings, since the world began. WWE 2K22, a card in MyGM mode The My Ascent mode is also making a comeback, which will see us create a character from scratch and start from the Orlando Performance Center to make a name for ourselves, grow as athletes and communicators, to finally debut on the main roster of one of the main shows of the WWE and fulfill our dream. Unfortunately, no substantial progress has been made compared to the past, but above all there are too many uploads that could sap your enthusiasm and from the point of view they make very little sense: a wait of about seventeen seconds each time, on Xbox Series X, to load a simple dialogue? Added to this content is the traditional editor for creating everything from superstars to move repertoires, from videos to arenas, and the online sector, represented by multiplayer matches and the My Faction mode. Thanks to the first updates of WWE 2K22, Visual Concepts has managed to fix many of the problems with the servers experienced during the review and the first days of publication of the game, making the online experience much more consistent than when we carried out the test. Graphics and sound WWE 2K22, Edge at ringside after a victory If the contents of WWE 2K22 are not exciting, it must certainly be recognized that Visual Concepts has done a remarkable job in terms of graphics and sound. There are still situations of obvious imbalance between certain characters, many have a ~premium~ look (including several female wrestlers) and others are a (nice) bit sketchy, but in any case we are faced with the best wrestling game ever from the point of view from a visual point of view. The soundtrack is once again a rich mix of signature songs and entrance music that is unlikely to disappoint fans, as well as the English voice acting that can be enjoyed in My Ascent mode, performed by the superstars we see on the screen . Finally, as regards the commentary of the matches, we found it quite varied and effective.", "date": "2022-03-12", "grade": "7.0"}
