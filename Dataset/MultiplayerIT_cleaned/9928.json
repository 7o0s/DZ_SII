So far we have seen this videogame trend expressing itself on the App Store especially in the sub-genre of ~tower defense~, those strategic details in which in each stage we must resist the attack of an ever-increasing number of enemies, placing our defenses in the best way and strengthening them not as soon as possible. Land Air Sea Warfare, however, looks like a classic RTS with a war background, in which our aim is to annihilate the opponent (or opponents, up to three, controlled by the AI) within a single scenario , moving dozens and dozens of vehicles by land, air and water. We talked about ~a single scenario~ not by chance, as one of the peculiarities (and limitations) of the product developed by Isotope 244 lies in the lack of any game mode, with the experience being renewed thanks to the numerous options and random stipulations that can be accessed from the start screen. Let's see how. Paper, scissors or rock? When you start a game, Land Air Sea Warfare can automatically generate a stage and the objectives to be achieved to achieve victory, but these are elements that we can also determine manually, choosing from ten types of environment (mainland, oceanic, islands, oasis, choke point, center point, outlands, islets, swamp, continental, fortress), four climatic variables (grassland, volcanic, tundra and desert) and five difficulty levels. As mentioned above, it is possible to face one to three AI-controlled enemy armies, adjust the technological level available to the units, determine the size of the map and how unexplored areas are displayed, and finally decide the useful conditions to achieve victory: the total destruction of all enemies or only the bases, the arms race or the elimination of one's companions at the end of the mission. Whatever the choices made, the stage is loaded quickly and we find ourselves in the classic starting situation of every RTS, i.e. with an operational base and a certain amount of resources to be used to build floating structures or terrestrial stakeouts, from which to then give the off to the manufacture of energy plants and vehicles of various types. The construction phase takes place relatively calmly, in the sense that the enemy will hardly dare to attack us if he does not yet have enough troops to eliminate us completely. We can therefore dedicate the first few minutes to an exploration of the surrounding areas, with the gray areas that thin out as in Warcraft 3 and the presence of any unit to allow us to build new buildings even far from the initial settlement. The moment you bump into the enemy, things quickly heat up. The combat system is based on automatisms that work quite well, with the vehicles starting to fire collectively towards the closest target but which we can also direct towards a desired target (for example a factory). The interface allows us to organize up to four groups of units, group them and command their movements with a simple touch of the screen. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the controls leaves much to be desired and is not sufficiently ~assisted~ to remedy the small size of the objects on the screen, moreover we have repeatedly seen a group mysteriously ~deselected~ after a couple of moves. Finally, the graphic sector turns out to be too repetitive in the textures and ~edgy~ in the selection elements, with an often difficult visibility of the troops.
