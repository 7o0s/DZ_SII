In short, all the international teams are there to battle it out once again on the turf of the stadiums of the old continent to win a trophy. Also in the purely videogame field, the challenge this year promises to be more exciting than ever, with the ~enemies~ of all time, Konami and EA, fierce and ready to collide to earn the scepter of ~King~ in the field of football simulations, thanks to their productions on the subject. Although once again it is the Canadian company that has an advantage over the competition, given the excellent results obtained starting from the 2008 edition with a series of products that have been able to renew themselves for the better from year to year until transforming the series into the which is now recognized as the football simulation par excellence, and a solid base consisting above all of an extremely varied gameplay that gives the player full freedom. But will it be like this again this season? Once the game is loaded, the menu that awaits the player is aesthetically different from last year's, even if the layout of the contents remains similar. The differences are rather marginal and mainly concentrated in the interface, which requires fewer steps than in the past. Through it you can access the various modes of FIFA 13, which are largely the same as in 2012 even if some can boast more options, and a totally new one. For this reason, and therefore to be able to focus on the most interesting news, we are dismissing Season immediately, very similar to the previous season apart from the addition of new matchmaking options, a trophy cabinet and new division titles. A future in the national team In the same way we briefly mention the presence of one's own virtual footballer and the challenges to increase his characteristics, the creation center integrated with the official website for players, clubs and tournaments, an area reserved for training complete with prize trials, then Support the your Club and Xbox Live, available with the usual friendlies, customizable challenges and with the added novelty of being able to play an entire season, a factor that adds promotions, relegations and titles to the 11vs11 game dynamic. Like PES 2013, we were unable to try the entire online part for the same reasons, and also in this case we can limit ourselves purely to the description. The most substantial and interesting news in terms of content comes from EAS FC and the Career mode. The first is present in two different forms: the traditional EA Sports Football Club, which once again represents the culmination of statistical production and data collection across all game modes, this year, among other things, accompanied by a coin virtual that accumulates by playing and which can be spent to unlock historic teams, balls but also small help for online and offline. And the new EAS FC Match Day, which now includes options for friendlies. In addition to this, however, there is also a very intriguing novelty: if you are constantly connected to the EA servers, updates are downloaded relating to the real matches of the week, the teams, the form of individual players, the injured list and that of the disqualified, the module changes made by the coach and so on. All this information not only affects their respective counterparts in the game, depriving the starting eleven of some important pieces there too, but also on the commentary, given that during the game the reporters refer to the absences on the field of a champion rather than the previous the two contenders or the current position in the actual championship. During a Juventus-Milan or a Barcelona-Real one can therefore happen to hear those who comment highlight Pato's absence among the Rossoneri or Puyol's among the Blaugrana, as well as the fact that the four clubs finished first and second in Serie A and in La Liga. Also in this session you can also play the games of the week and those of the month. However, the fulcrum of the single player component is, as always, the Career mode, which in FIFA plays a particularly important role given that it potentially guarantees dozens of hours of gameplay for those who like to put themselves in the role of a club or national team coach (with this new option you can take part in the various qualifying rounds and international themed competitions) or in that of player, choosing whether to impersonate a real athlete or his own virtual alter ego. In the firstcase, after having decided on the look (overalls or jacket and tie), the physique and complexion of the coach, to then move on to more managerial aspects such as the possibility of taxing sales, starting immediately with the trophies (complete with lots of draws ), the adventure begins, and as always in this mode you can do practically anything to better follow and control your team. In this sense, the developers have tried to give more prominence to the identification aspect by increasing the amount of news related to teams and tournaments, to the expectations of the fans and those of the management. In the same way there is a constant dialogue with their players who go to the bench, and with the press. But the most interesting aspect remains the transfer market, which in FIFA 13 has undergone a series of tweaks to try to make the role played by the gamer more realistic. In addition to an artificial intelligence of the other managers that operates in a more logical way (even if it still commits naiveties from time to time), there is the welcome (it was about time) introduction of the possibility of inserting technical counterparts within the negotiations to lower the cash to invest in cash on the price tag of the coveted player. Faces from FIFA As per tradition, FIFA 13 offers many club championships fully covered by official licenses both for the tournament and for the teams that participate in it. However, our Serie A is present without the tournament logo and with Napoli which unfortunately does not have the shirts and the official crest: the Neapolitan fans will therefore have to wait for the probable DLC that EA will release in the future in this regard, given that the Canadian company seems to have made a last-minute deal with the Campania company. Meanwhile fans will be able to console themselves with the real faces of Cavani and Marek Hamsik. The same cannot happen for the fans of other teams, given that once again the faces of the various Vucinic, Vidal, Milito and the singer company are not the real ones. As far as Serie B is concerned, the only club that can boast official kits and branding is Novara: however, finally, the other teams not covered in this sense have logos more similar to those of the teams they represent and the coloring and design of the their jerseys are almost faithful to the originals. Finally, the absence of the Camp Nou in Barcelona has been confirmed, for which EA no longer has the rights, and the updating of the team rosters on the last day of the transfer market, with the various Cassanos at Inter, Bendtner at Juve, etc. However, a couple of mistakes should be noted: Drogba who is in force at Barcelona and Hulk still at Porto. Watch the numbers In the latter case, however, it is necessary to take into account the budget available to the club to which one wants to give one's own element, since if the latter has a high salary, the potential new club could refuse its services and effectively force the user to spend cash only. It is not clear then whether the man offered in return can refuse the destination for issues related perhaps to the low prestige of his next destination by breaking the bank: during our tests, at the helm of the Juventus Champion of Italy, in fact, Giaccarini refused to go to West Ham as a partial bargaining chip, but he did so only for a mere economic issue (he didn't reach an agreement with the English club), while De Ceglie didn't bat an eyelid and accepted to be included in a negotiation that brought full-back Ansaldi from Rubin Kazan to black and white and him to Russia. In this regard, the mode in question deserves a separate discussion if you play it as a simple novice footballer. If you are part of a big team the manager will try to loan him to some second-tier club to make him gain experience. However the user can refuse the offer and stay. But in this case, contrary to what happened last year when nine out of ten started starting even in place of established champions, this time he will have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts to earn his own space, satisfying the minimum requests of the coach and making the most of the few occasions that will happen to him, otherwise he will often go to the stands. For the rest, in general there are more variables both in the purchase phase (for example a footballer can ask for a permanent position as owner to change the scene) and in the sale phase (it is possible to request an evaluation of the player using a specific option), as for example the fact that the richest teams tend not to sell their quality players, or that alongside the value of each athlete's card there is a more important one, which is that of the transfer market. This means that if player X is officially worth 25 mimillions of euros it is not said that the company to which he belongs is willing to sell him at those figures. If the athlete is important to the team or has many requests, it is easy in fact that the price of his card can rise dramatically or that an attempt to enter into a negotiation can be rejected. The search for talent has also undergone several changes, above all as regards the growth curve of players, which now rightly foresees a technical maturation of young players even when they are not employed in every game, but are still part of the first team, ideally training with more established champions and participating in the successes of the club. In short, Career remains a mode without any inclination to imitate more complex managerial simulations, but with the new features introduced it is decidedly more interesting to experience. Xbox 360 goals FIFA 13 gives gamers no less than forty-eight achievements to unlock. To do this it is necessary to satisfy the most diverse requests of the game such as for example repelling a free kick with the barrier, playing the first game with your Virtual Player, winning all the daily matches of the week in EAS FC in seven days or triumphing in a cup during the Head to Head seasons. Truer than true In our lengthy analysis we obviously haven't forgotten about Ultimate Team, the ~game within a game~ that allows users to create their own ideal team by basing purchases and exchanges on a complex ebay-style system. For reasons of space and in order not to limit ourselves to writing a few lines on this mode much loved by fans, we prefer to direct you to our tried one available at this address. Here, however, after having extensively dissected the game options, we finally prefer to focus on the actual gameplay. In this sense, there are five focal points on which the developers have focused this year to improve a playability that was already based on very solid foundations. The first is the so-called first touch control, an element linked in particular to both normal and continuing stops. Thanks to it, what happens in the ball control phase is now contextual to what happens in that moment on the pitch, therefore to the technical characteristics of whoever makes and receives a pass, to the intensity and precision of the same, to the way in which receives the ball, field conditions, etc. Obviously, someone like Messi will struggle less to keep the ball than an honest midfield pedaler with unsophisticated feet, who instead will either control badly, losing the ball, or will take more time to tame it. The second parameter EA has worked on is the system that manages dribbling. In this sense, the development team has tried to simplify a good part of them by tying their execution to the left analog stick. Based on the game situation and how the controlled player positions himself in front of the opponent, various types of feints can be created, even by moving only the stick, aided in this by a new set of animations which we will discuss in detail later. What has just been described does not mean that making certain moves is easy, but only more accessible to everyone. In fact, it is always possible to use the left bumper or the two triggers to develop more complex plays, for close control of the ball, or to protect it from in front or behind. Great attention was then placed on the impact engine, of which almost all the most evident bugs of the last edition have been fixed for a completely renewed management of collisions between players and with the ball. Just to give some concrete examples, luckily we no longer see pairs of players from the same team clumsily hindering each other in an attempt to go on the ball together (basically now one of the two tries to get away from the trajectory of the ball or from that of his partner); the different physicality of the players is more felt both in the way they move and in the way they act in the tackles, with the bigger ones making their size more felt on the smaller ones, now more likely to fall or lose contact with the ball if properly hindered, perhaps, in the case of a defender controlled by the user, with a quick and non-repeated pressure of the X button (Square on PS3) to operate a slight jerk that makes the opponent lose his balance, or after a slide realistic. Also for this reason it becomes important to know how to choose the time well for insertions or to get out of the way, especially in aerial play, where, contrary to what happens in PES, there is nothing pre-calculated and the system that calculates and manages the physical impacts works duty.
