{"name": "NBA Clash", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-clash-recensione.html", "text": "Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the United States and it is therefore completely natural that a wide selection of basketball games is available on the App Store and Google Play: some dedicated to simulated realism, such as the recent NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition; others, many others, set according to an arcade approach that often introduces interesting and innovative solutions. -on-one and mechanics similar to a real-time strategy, recalling the blockbuster Clash Royale in the management of cards and characters. Tantalizing, right? Gameplay NBA Clash, teams face off on the court Let's start from the gameplay, which is introduced through a simple tutorial when you start the game for the first time. Using a portrait-style view, with a vertical overview of the field, our goal in NBA Clash will be to lead a team of three players to victory, reaching eleven points before our opponent: simple and fast. What is surprising are the controls and, in general, the management of movements. The athletes on the field automatically move towards the other team's basket, but then stop waiting for our inputs: touching the player in possession of the ball will indicate him to shoot, touching one without the ball will signal the pass, draw trajectories in depth will trigger dunks or alley-oops, and so on. The same goes in the defensive phase: touching the player closest to the ball will make him jump in an attempt to block a possible shot, a slide will indicate him instead of trying to steal the ball, while touching another team member will call him as a reinforcement. Naturally the point is to prevent the opposing team from scoring, regaining the ball and quickly projecting towards their basket, but there is an extra consisting of the cards present in the lower part of the screen, which ensure special abilities linked to individual athletes. Just like in the aforementioned Clash Royale, the matches are strictly in online multiplayer and the matchmaking is almost instantaneous, which eliminates expectations, but creates some doubts about the fact that there are bots crowding the servers, as well as many human users who however we are sure we have encountered them during our tests (also because we have taken them). Structure NBA Clash, Clash Royale-style card management The original and innovative NBA Clash system needs a bit of running in to be fully understood and exploited to the fullest, but after a while it manages to return great satisfaction. Around it the developers have built a structure which, as mentioned, takes up that of the Supercell classic, with the same use of cards and packages, as well as the four slots for opening the timed boxes. As per the script, the first hours are characterized by the abundant release of free items and unlocked achievements, which allows you to create fairly competitive decks and in line with our style. Obtaining the same cards allows players to be upgraded by paying a small amount of gold, and the lack of an action energy indicator will see us playing games without problems or waiting times. Technical realization NBA Clash, a meeting on the field of the Lakers As mentioned above, NBA Clash has just undergone a technical overhaul and the graphics of the game looked great to us. The matches begin with a view that slowly moves across the field, framing it from above vertically and reflecting the elements of the stadium on the parquet at this juncture, to then eliminate this effect to prevent it from creating problems with readability of the action. The players are well characterized and have a decent set of animations, the special effects that accompany the activation of skills know how to add spectacularity to the exchanges and the sound sector supports the experience in a surprising way, thanks to a series of songs that immediately enter your head and prove to be decidedly spot on for the theme.", "date": "2022-11-25", "grade": "8.0"}
