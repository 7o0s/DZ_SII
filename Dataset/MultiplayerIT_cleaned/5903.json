{"name": "Rebel Galaxy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/158796-rebel-galaxy-lultima-frontiera.html", "text": "Rebel Galaxy is part of a narrative that has a strong following even if it is not particularly easy to sell. For many spaceships and cowboys are two incompatible elements but in both cases we are dealing with a frontier made of huge empty spaces, with new trade routes, majestic visions and unknown populations. It is no coincidence that a western vein is present in a good part of science fiction, even if not always explicitly. Unlike what often happens, Rebel Galaxy between southern music and space saloons is reminiscent of both Starcraft and the Firefly series, it does not hide certain inspirations and it is certainly not a bad thing. But suggestions aside, how does it behave at a playful level? Rebel Galaxy is a classic space simulator with non-simulating gameplay Space Cowboys At first glance, apart from the particular setting, Rebel Galaxy is the classic space simulator that is based on trade, quests, combat, warp speed travel with the possibility of changing the route in real time and ships to be upgraded. The possibilities granted to the player include the extraction of minerals from asteroids, factions to support or antagonize, mercenaries to hire as wingmen, illegal trade, bounties, a lot of space stations and the inevitable random encounters which, in addition to breaking the monotony, allow you to recover precious cargo. Finally there is the dynamic economy which varies day by day and whose prices are influenced by narrative events which can also see us involved in invasions or convoys to be intercepted. All embellished by a pleasant technical sector and a soundtrack that goes perfectly with the space western setting. Considering that all of this, net of outsourced work such as the soundtrack, was built by just two developers, there is reason to be amazed. Even if the two are Travis Baldree and Erich Schaefer, people with productions of the caliber of Diablo behind them, nothing we have mentioned so far shines for freshness or innovation and in this period the competition in the space sim genre is definitely on. But there is one point where Rebel Galaxy clearly stands out and is both the defining element and the most controversial one. Before dealing with it, however, let's complete the essential list of possibilities that will allow us to better understand the title. Let's start by saying that the spaceship fleet is quite rich with vessels that are very different from each other also in terms of size, all equipped with a lot of slots that allow you to install all kinds of weapons, defenses and extra systems. The purchasable components include turrets, hull reinforcements, engines, boosters, energy shields, very expensive subsystems and a lot of sidearms that are very important. And here we are finally arrived at that distinctive element that concerns the combat of Rebel Galaxy. Pressing a key allows us to enter Precision Striking mode and therefore allows us to rotate the camera without altering the ship's course. Basically we can cannon from the side like in a vintage naval battle. It is an original setting which, given the very high reactivity of the spaceships, does not linger too much on the tactical dimension but offers great satisfaction. But for this concept to work, the developers had to give up something... and we're talking about the third dimension. The space of Rebel Galaxy develops in two dimensions allowing us to change course only in the longitudinal direction. During the fights, the ships still move a few meters up or down, which allows the whole thing to remain somewhat believable, but it is clear that this limitation can be too heavy for many players to digest. Yet it is an interesting choice that puts us in front of an arcade approach which, thanks to an intuitive and understandable interface, takes the form of a fresh and very accessible space simulation. Stubborn enemies and too lucky Rebel Galaxy, also arriving on new generation consoles, does not give up almost anything from the point of view of space simulation while strongly detaching itself from the genre and for this very reason it is fresh and accessible. The first missions are simple, accompanied by comprehensive tooltips and help us improve the equipment, but it doesn't take long for difficult assignments to become available that we will soon find ourselves facing amidst ambushes by pirates and enemy factions. In short, things can get complicated but the aim of the enemies is not infallible, the energy shield is pretty powerful and it is almost always possible to escape even from the most desperate situations by dosing the boosters and keeping an eye onor the radar which is very easy to interpret thanks to the two-dimensional setting of the action. However, it is not possible to hope to get away with forgetting to keep your ship updated and to do so you need credits that can be obtained more quickly by collecting information from the bartenders and sifting through the news available in the stations where, usually, we also find ourselves facing strange figures who they guide along the narrative dimension of the adventure. The plot is not particularly complex but there are some noteworthy characters who manage to involve us just enough. Too bad for some models, for the portraits of the pirates all the same and for the fluctuating dubbing, but considering the production shot, there is no need to be too picky. The problems of this game are quite different and they don't even concern the repetitiveness that in Rebel Galaxy, thanks to various random events that also guarantee discounts and fame, is not more marked than what we have seen in most space simulators. The problem, more than anything else, concerns a certain feeling of falsehood that castrates the dynamism that should underlie any title of this genre. And instead we are faced with almost inevitable enemies that appear on our way regardless of the route we are following or any attempts to get around them. Of course, as we have already said, it is almost always possible to escape from all ambushes, but the mere fact of knowing that there are ships that artificially appear on our route cracks the magic that undoubtedly dwells between the lines of code of the Double Damage title. Furthermore, the enemies continue to attack relentlessly, regardless of the power of our ship and the number of victims we have caused them, thus making them even less credible and further compromising their involvement. Yet Rebel Galaxy works and it does even when enemies move freely around us who are nailed to two dimensions. Compromises and forcings are lost in the freshness of the combat which gives us a lot of show seasoned with lights, carefully differentiated effects depending on the weapon and explosions. There is no landing at the stations and the polygonal mass is visibly limited but the soundtrack adequately compensates for the technical shortcomings, unfortunately excluding that of the Italian adaptation, which is completely absent.", "date": "2015-11-11", "grade": "S.V."}
