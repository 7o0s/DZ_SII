But you're not the only one who is put to the test. You know I had a wife? Beautiful, right? But we were expecting our first child and we were just over what two little boys. I was terrified. Becoming a father... how would we have done with the money? But she was calm, she had faith that it would go well. She has always had faith. Then one day she went to visit a friend of hers. An accident and.. God takes away.~ Joseph Seed's monologue in Far Cry 5, masterfully interpreted by Luca Ghignone in the Italian version of the game, seemed to us the perfect introduction for the review of Joseph: Collapse, the third and final DLC of Far Cry 6 and therefore the package that closes this peculiar Season Pass dedicated to the most famous villains of the Ubisoft series. A conclusion worthy of expectations? Setting Joseph: Collapse takes us to an alternate but not very atmospheric version of Hope County If in Vaas: Insanity (review) we found ourselves wandering in a dreamlike and distorted version of the Rook Islands and in Pagan: Control (review) we instead explored a splendid reinterpretation of the Kyrat, the setting of Joseph: Collapse is obviously that of hope county and Pagan, proposing very similar dimensions and an aesthetic often contaminated by what happens in the ending of Far Cry 5, as well as by the post-apocalyptic expansion New Dawn, between portions of incinerated woods and ruined buildings. However, the overall design is substantially less successful than that of the Kyrat. Engaged in the now classic five ~cycles~ that are the same but progressively more demanding, within this ~nightmare~ version of Hope County we will find a series of unlockable shelters where we can stop to catch our breath and spend the credits obtained to buy permanent upgrades, that survive the roguelite formula of the experience, and to ~pump~ the weapon cases available in lootbox style but without microtransactions, fortunately. Then there are several places of interest, where you can complete the main missions of the DLC and therefore collect the three parts of Joseph's cross that will allow him to literally cross Eden's Gate, or come into contact with visions that go deeper the relationship between the ~Father~ and his disciples, in particular the lieutenants John, Jacob and Faith, without however revealing a background that has not already been told in Far Cry 5: a notable lack when you focus strongly on the fanservice. Gameplay Joseph Collapse includes locations we visited in the Far Cry 5 campaign The formula of Joseph: Collapse is therefore the one we already know: a roguelite shooter with a few too many problems in terms of hitbox, but which in some sequences recalls a frenetic and fun run & gun style gameplay. Turning around the map, you face the ~shadows~ of the members of the sect created by Joseph Seed to earn credits, unlock new upgrades to increase your chances of survival and try to complete the final challenge in order to then start the game from the next cycle. Game over implies the loss of the resources collected up to that moment, but with several exceptions: the aforementioned permanent traits, the weapons unlocked by overcoming specific challenges and even the credits, where certain upgrades have been obtained. At night the situation becomes more complicated due to the presence of ghosts who try to explode on us, while the inevitable boss fights will see us this time fighting the aforementioned John, Jacob and Faith as well as their endless hordes of followers. Graphics and sound Joseph: Collapse, a platform section where you have to destroy certain objects to purify the area As already mentioned, the Hope County represented in Joseph: Collapse unfortunately does not boast the suggestive panoramas of the dreamlike Kyrat that we visited in the role of Pagan Min, on the contrary it presents itself as a rather dull and generic scenario. The presence of structures seen in the Far Cry 5 campaign causes its prices to increase a bit, as well as the visual references to the New Dawn expansion, but in general there is not much to be enthusiastic about. The sound sector stands up almost exclusively on the excellent interpretation of Greg Bryk, given that clearly the dialogues are only in English and there is no dubbing in Italian, as unfortunately happened for the base game: a choice that we still struggle to understand for one of the most famous franchises by Ubisoft. Finally, the music reveals itself sonly functional to the action. In conclusion The roguelite formula imagined by Ubisoft for the Far Cry 6 DLC unfortunately arrives with shortness of breath at the third and final appointment, the one with Joseph Seed. Compared to the packages dedicated to Vaas Montenegro and Pagan Min, Joseph: Collapse cannot in fact boast sufficient narrative content to justify the purchase. Almost all the ~visions~ of the protagonist relating to his lieutenants do nothing but rehash things already known to those who have completed the Far Cry 5 campaign and the New Dawn expansion, and so the important component of the fanservice is missing, together with a much less inspired setting compared to the colors and architectures of Pagan: Control.", "date": "2022-02-07", "grade": null}
