How can we stop them? Well, if Devil Invasion were a normal ~tower defense~, as you see many on the App Store, we could organize a border line made up of positions that are as resistant as they are capable of causing damage, then place any turrets in a further back area to eliminate any monster able to get past the first zone. The title developed by the Korean Touchmine, however, is instead a classic puzzle game and our goal to complete each stage is to align three or more elements of the same color on a board. But how do these two souls combine? Simple: in the upper part of the screen we see the advance of the demons, who march towards our defensive positions and must be stopped before they get too close to the castle; in the lower part of the screen, however, we have the classic board with asymmetrical boxes, full of elements to align. It's almost magic, Johnny Luck has it that our alter ego in Devil Invasion is not a simple warrior, but a powerful wizard. The board he uses to align the elements translates his spells into reality, unleashing devastating blows against the gigantic demons that threaten to destroy the castle. At the beginning of the game we are asked what kind of elemental magic we intend to use against our enemies, and each of them requires a certain number of red, green, gold or blue objects to be prepared. By aligning the elements on the board, therefore, we are going to fill the counters with these ~ingredients~, which as soon as possible allow us to hurl the fury of fire, water, air or earth on our opponents. This is our most powerful attack, but not the only one: shield-shaped elements are also hidden between the boxes which, once coupled and eliminated, start an offensive maneuver. In each of the numerous stages available, the same story repeats itself: the monsters advance and we must be quick enough to put together the elements necessary to repel them, with a degree of difficulty that clearly increases as we proceed. Also at the beginning of the game we are asked if we want to play the game on an easy, normal or difficult level. Well, things change substantially according to our choices: at the easy level it is possible to get the better of the enemies in a relatively easy but far from obvious way, while at the normal or difficult level the frustration is felt a lot: entrusting our fate and the effectiveness of our attacks on chance rather than on our strategic skills is not the best of life, and puzzle games with a time limit (this is the situation in the end) are not famous for their ~lightness~ , On the contrary. In this case we must also add a certain lack of precision in the control system: to align the elements on the board we have to drag them with our fingers, but these are very small objects and on more than one occasion it happens to move the wrong one. The technical sector effectively supports the action: the battle that rages at the top of the screen is quite well represented, with good use of colors and decent animations, while the music is a bit repetitive.
