{"name": "World of Warcraft: Shadowlands", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-recensione.html", "text": "Almost a month after the launch of World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, having sunk the claws of our pandaren into the maximum level content, we can say with some certainty that the new expansion has all the credentials to be remembered, over time, as one of the best in the long history of the MMORPG. As we have already written in our first test, in fact, we liked the campaign that took us from level 50 to level 60 very much, as well as the new setting of the Terretetre, the Covens characteristics and the various characters we met in this colorful Afterlife. MMORPGs are fickle business, though; subject to grafting, updating and balancing, they always risk changing course suddenly, and not always for the better. Those who played the previous expansions will well remember Warlords of Draenor's sensational beginning and its rapid and inexorable decline, for example, not to mention the barrage of risky decisions that made Battle for Azeroth one of the most controversial expansions of World of Warcraft. In short, the power of Shadowlands will only be understood in a few months: the review of an expansion, in this sense, serves to tell you if the game deserves your attention now, in the period in which it was released, and our own overall judgment it could change at the end of its life cycle. Shadowlands, however, has a lot to offer to those who love World of Warcraft or are new to playing it, for better or for worse. The Congregations We have already discussed the transition from 50 to 60, now let's see how the progression behaves once you reach the maximum level and have closed the campaign at the gates of the first raid, Nathria Castle. The subsequent missions in fact serve to introduce us to a series of mechanics that are intertwined on several occasions, while maintaining fundamentally separate identities. The most important choice to make, after all, concerns the Covenants: we have known them during the campaign, we have temporarily used the specific skills that change by class or specialization, and then the time comes to decide which side to take. The choice of the Coven may depend on several factors. The two temporary skills of a Congregation will definitely become part of our arsenal, regardless of the area in which we find ourselves, so the more methodical ones will prefer the one that guarantees the best performance in combat. Some might instead prefer the aesthetic aspect, leaning towards the Coven that unlocks the mounts or armor they value the most. Someone else may just want to continue the storylines started in the campaign, as choosing the Covenant unlocks a specific new storyline. We, for example, have chosen the Kyrian of the Bastion for our Monk and the Night Fae of Ardenwild with our Wizard: in the first case, we have continued to fight in the conflict between the Ascended which also involves the mythical Uther, while with the Wizard we have find yourself chasing Tyrande and helping none other than Bwonsamdi. The storylines of the Congregations then converge in some expeditions, which acquire a narrative sense: you can also repeat Spires of Ascension a thousand times in search of a jewel or other loot, but without playing in the Kyrian Congregation you will never know why you ended up there. Progression in the Covens develops through about thirty steps that are unlocked by acquiring Fame, a special currency awarded through various activities. Each new Renown rank unlocks new quests, new content, upgrades, or loot, continually granting another milestone to reach. In this sense, therefore, the Leagues have excellent value in terms of replay value. Changing Coven is possible but very penalizing, so the ideal path remains to grow more secondary characters to discover every aspect of the intricate story of Shadowlands. Fame's catch-up system allows secondary characters to line up with the main ones in a short time and without particular effort; moreover, the Anima - the currency needed to unlock the different features of each Covenant - is of secondary importance in the progression. Obviously players who aim to see everything with each character will have to be prepared to devote many hours a day to World of Warcraft, but for a casual player, and for those who focus all their spare time mainly on one character, Covenants are accessible and full of opportunities. We also appreciated the effort with which Blizzard has integrated in a lesser and not entirely derivative way some more or less appreciated features of the past: the Constraints ofthe soul are practically the Legion Artifact weapons in rose water, but they still offer a minimum level of customization, and the followers board is also back, albeit enormously resized and redesigned. And fortunately, we would add: it is still possible to follow the missions remotely with the smartphone app, but their importance, compared to the past, is much lower, and they constitute only a secondary and vaguely passive addition to the already large stack of accessible content. The Maw Blizzard has once again opted for a fairly interesting narrative and content solution: the expansion begins in an area that becomes inaccessible after the prologue, only to be unlocked in the endgame and after finishing the main campaign. It happened in Warlords of Draenor with the Jungle of Tanaan and in Legion with the Broken Shore, while in Shadowlands this task falls to the Maw. We will end up in this nasty underworld several times during the campaign, but only at the maximum level will we begin a series of missions that will lead us to explore it more and more thoroughly. The Fauce is a very peculiar place towards which we have ambivalent feelings, so to speak. It is the theater in which to spend a few minutes a day to complete daily missions that increase your reputation with Ve'nari, an NPC who offers us a safe hiding place and various services, as well as a series of missions that serve, in fact, to unlock each activity inside the Fauce. In the Maw, the player is continuously subjected to the scrutiny of the Jailer, the villain of the expansion who observes our deeds: the more activities we complete in the area, the more the risks we run increase. At some point we will end up being regularly bombed, trapped, attacked or even kidnapped by Sylvanas Windrunner's Valkyries, and our stay in the Maw will become practically impossible, also because Blizzard has integrated a vague roguelite component: a currency accumulates in the Maw called Stygia which is used to purchase the goods of Ve'nari. By dying, a part of the accumulated Stygia is lost, and the only way to get it back is to return to the corpse. If you die again on the way back, though... well, we get it. For this reason it is better to venture into the Maw in groups, since it is not even possible to summon mounts and therefore one is forced to walk or use the rare transport points. We are not sure, however, that we fully appreciated Blizzard's idea. Overall, we liked the risk component. It makes the experience adrenaline-pumping and forces us to choose our battles carefully, in order to avoid increasing the Jailer's attention too much and losing the opportunity to achieve specific objectives. We have experienced the Maw in the serenity of the PvE context, and we dare not imagine what stress it must be in War mode. The kingdom of the Jailer offers various rewards, but none of them seemed to us of particular value: the problem of the Fauce, in fact, lies in the banality of the proposed challenges. In practice it is a question of going around the map and defeating any rare enemies, alone or possibly in a group, but if we exclude the campaign missions that bring us ever closer to the Jailer and Sylvanas, the Maw becomes practically an annoying daily task to hurry up as fast as possible. Fortunately, you only have to dedicate a few minutes a day to it but, in fact, from this point of view, the overall sense of an area that, perhaps, will be developed more in the updates to come, is somewhat lost. Torgast Tower of the Damned is probably the content we were most curious to play. Widely advertised by Blizzard as the first true roguelite experience in its MMORPG, suitable for solo players and small groups, Torgast has all the potential to become one of the most beloved activities in World of Warcraft if the Californian developer can succeed to smooth out the various angularities. Torgast is worth explaining to those who have not followed the evolution of Shadowlands: in terms of narrative, Torgast is the prison in which the Jailer has trapped the main heroes of Azeroth such as Anduin, Jaina, Thrall and Baine. Our task will be to explore the Tower to find them and, at the same time, become more powerful. Torgast is in fact the place where we will accumulate the Soul Ashes, a fundamental currency for building the new legendary equipment with the help of the mysterious Rune Engraver. Let's go step by step. Exploring Torgast, outside of the campaign missions that take place within it, means accessing one of the two wings opened each week, alone or in a group. Each wing is cmade up of eight blocks of increasing difficulty: having chosen the block to explore, we will have to overcome six floors to reach the exit. Completing the block earns Soul Ashes, and the harder the block, the more Ashes you earn. So far, it's all pretty ordinary. Torgast, however, is anything but an ordinary experience, at least on the surface. The blocks change structure randomly, and the maps, enemy layouts, and side-quests change with each playthrough. Each player in the group increases the total number of deaths which, once depleted, also triggers a timer: at which point the plan must be completed before a gigantic monster called Trucidasque reaches us and blasts us out. Enemies in the Tower drop a currency called Phantasma which resets every time we leave Torgast and which can be exchanged at special NPCs inside for so-called Anima Powers. Powers are temporary bonuses that disappear when you exit the block and give the player the most strategic and bizarre bonuses: you go from simple statistical modifiers to secondary effects of the various skills that can make the difference in fights. The randomness of the Anima Powers obtained in matches represents one of the most enjoyable aspects of Torgast, also because the difficulty scales with the number of players in the group, allowing everyone to tackle the content at their own pace. There is still something to fix in terms of balance - the first corrective patch has already changed some aspects of the experience, and not entirely in a positive way - but in our opinion Blizzard has to work on the structure more deeply because, after the initial enthusiasm for a new and certainly innovative content for World of Warcraft standards, Torgast turned out to be nothing more than a long, exhausting grind of monsters. Unless you play in a group with the appropriate equipment, completing a block still takes a long time and the only reward you get at the end is a currency and some coins, if you manage to finish the game: it can also happen of wasting a lot of time getting nothing done, and that's not good at all. Torgast's currency, Soul Ashes, is still very important because it is used to craft the new legendary equipment. In this sense, Blizzard has listened to the players and revised and corrected the process that began with the random legendaries in Legion: the players had greatly appreciated their implications in terms of gameplay, minus the completely random component in the find. Shadowlands takes the best of both worlds, as currencies and materials are now consumed - which, moreover, restore a certain importance to all crafting professions, finally - to combine them into an object that allows the player to choose, within certain limits, the slot and even the secondary stats. As for the legendary powers, finding them is a kind of game within the game: the Adventure Guide itself tells us how to get them, which bosses to plunder and so on; the chances of receiving them are usually very high and so one feels motivated to expand the collection of memories of the Runecarver. Then you can still equip only one legendary at a time and you have to ~farm~ materials and currencies to increase their power, so commitment and perseverance remain necessary, but the mechanism is much more meritocratic than in the past. Challenges and secrets for everyone The collecting component has become very important within World of Warcraft: it stimulates the more hardcore players to complete all types of content and keeps the attention of the more casual players who can decide how to spend their time, aiming for many objectives within the reach of solitaire players or small groups such as feats, mounts, toys, pets, and so on. In this sense, Shadowlands is literally a monument to compulsive collecting. Blizzard has literally filled every map with secrets, challenges and collectibles, environmental puzzles, real puzzles that sometimes require a fair level of collaboration: the most striking example is the rare Macabre monster in Selvarden, which must be summoned by making the ones dance with the other three players at the same time! The game designers have exploited the complex geometry of the maps, which develop in all dimensions much more than in the past, to fill every path with obstacles and force players to use their brains and cunning, at least until it is possible to fly even in the Shadowlands. We only feel like criticizing the arrangement of flight masters and transport systems which, without the dear old Whistle, make travel from a map", "date": "2020-12-17", "grade": "8.5"}
