It is a software that automatically generates, often in a completely random way, the conformation of a dungeon: dimensions, objects, enemies, events and so on. In the case of Dungeon Raid, we are faced with a puzzle game that bases its charm on a solution of this type, managing to offer extraordinary playability and involvement despite a technical sector that defining essential is an understatement. But how exactly does it work? From the start screen it is only possible to choose whether to start a new game or continue a previously interrupted one, then select a difficulty level among the three available (easy, medium, hard) and face the pitfalls of the dungeon that the title created by Fireflame Games has generated for us. The graphical interface shows us in the upper part of the touch screen four slots that can contain as many bonuses, while in the lower part we find respectively, starting from the left, the indicator of the amount of gold coins collected, the attack values of the enemies, the shields available for the armor, our attack values and finally a ~container~ with our vital energy inside. In the middle is a 6 x 6 square board featuring swords (which allow us to carry out attacks), shields (which fill up our armor gauge), potions (which restore our life energy), coins of 'gold (essential for the purchase of upgrades) and finally the enemies, represented by skulls that can change in appearance depending on their ability: the initial opponents are wiped out in a group by a single sword blow, while the special ones are not they only manage to injure us significantly, but they also prove to be very resistant to our offensives. The power of alignment We've talked about swords, shields, coins and enemies, but how does Dungeon Raid allow us to align these elements so that we can interact with them? Simple: just touch a single object with your finger that is in contact (horizontally, vertically or obliquely) with at least two others of the same type, then draw a line that connects all these elements and then leave the touch screen for them to disappear. After that, the empty spaces on the board will be filled by the objects that are immediately above the eliminated ones, therefore with other elements falling from above. Through this maneuver we can collect coins, restore our vital energy and the shields of our armor. And the enemies? For them it works the same way, but swords and skulls must be aligned together: the former individually have a certain offensive value (shown below, as mentioned above) which must be subtracted from the number that expresses the resistance of the opponents. It therefore happens that the weaker enemies can be destroyed simply by aligning an entire group to a single sword, while on the other hand the special enemies must be aligned together with many swords to obtain the same effect. By earning coins and experience points it is possible to purchase permanent upgrades (for example an improvement in strength, defense or dexterity) or bonuses that can be spent only once (for example the one that eliminates a special enemy of your choice). As is often the case, explaining the gameplay of Dungeon Raid is much more complicated than trying it firsthand: just take a quick tour of the integrated tutorial to immediately understand how things work, then practice more with each game. Finally, the game includes a ranking (which can be shared via Game Center) which stores the results obtained for each difficulty level.
