The ambitious title produced by Square Enix and developed by Crystal Dynamics caught us off guard: we followed it for months as if we were on a roller coaster, between deafening silences and exciting announcements, except to approach it with a certain skepticism after a not exactly brilliant beta. To better understand the analysis that will follow, we invite you to read our test from a few days ago, to all intents and purposes the first part of this review which serves to close the circle on our reasoning and to make you understand, we hope, if it is worth buy Marvel's Avengers at launch or not. The Key to Extinction Multiplayer Edizioni will also publish a novel by October, written by Greg Keyes, which will act as a prequel to the events told in the game. Entitled Marvel's Avengers: The Key to Extinction, the story will tell some important background, better outlining certain characters who will play a key role in the Crystal Dynamics game. In The Key to Extinction, the Avengers will have to deal with the Zodiac, a team of super villains who have obtained their powers thanks to an ancient, deadly artifact. The single player campaign During the end credits we couldn't help but think that if Crystal Dynamics can deliver on its promise to support this project with updates that should punctually prolong the story, then Marvel's Avengers could already be considered half-successful, and that at the net of the many problems that peeked out before, after and during the finale. A somewhat hasty conclusion, to tell the truth, perhaps because it doesn't really conclude anything given that the story continues immediately in the missions of the Avengers Initiative and will continue in the future as the developer adds new heroes to the cast. Ironically, the very last lines are among the least successful moments of a campaign that at times reaches very high peaks. The writers of Marvel's Avengers deserve applause not so much for crafting a discrete narrative, but for understanding these iconic heroes that we've mocked for months, considering them pale imitations of the actors who played them in Disney movies, and who instead managed to stand up on their legs from start to finish. Already within a few missions the dialogues, interpretations and Italian dubbing had conquered us, helping us to better get used to the absolutely anonymous character design. In the intermission cinematics and in the exchanges during the missions, the Avengers that we know in the films and comics come back to life in this video game, sharing those traits so human and characteristic that made them the idols of entire generations. If Captain America and Thor come out more sacrificed due to their marginal presence in the campaign, the other Avengers are a joy to play and see interact. Even assuming a minimal smattering on the part of the players, the writers have managed in a few lines to convey all the camaraderie, empathy, solidarity and why not, the rivalry that characterizes this team of eccentric heroes. Kamala Khan fits wonderfully into the cast, the young Inhuman who tries at all costs to reunite the divided Avengers to stop AIM's plans: the campaign is to all intents and purposes her story, a path of growth and acceptance that remember what real heroes are made of. The villains, on the other hand, are less convincing, and if it is true that the nemeses make the heroes, then MODOK is one of the less prudent choices of this campaign. Already far less famous than Thanos, Loki or Ultron, the leader of AIM is a tragic figure that the writers failed to fully convey, giving him an obsession that the story never concretely explains. Unfortunately MODOK is the only villain worthy of the name, given that the others are even less popular or carve out tiny if not completely secondary spaces. Nonetheless, the campaign runs like a pleasure, thanks above all to the linear setting which forces the player to control very specific heroes in the various stages. This has allowed Crystal Dynamics to concoct extremely spectacular and daring sequences, drawing on perhaps even too grandiose ideas that the developer has translated into video with difficulty, making technical compromises that have sometimes risked nullifying any creative effort. Notnevertheless, the campaign passes through truly memorable moments that will glue to the sofa especially fans of the film or paper Avengers. The multiplayer problem Accessible from the very first moment on the home screen, the multiplayer sector of Marvel's Avengers called the Avengers Initiative exists parallel to the main campaign, in the sense that the progress made with the heroes in one mode is reflected in the other and vice versa: the game does not fail to inform us that the Avengers Initiative could anticipate future events to those who have not yet completed the campaign, since it uses the same hub, only projected into the future, when the Avengers have already gathered. It's an acceptable compromise that allows players to team up and step into the shoes of all six heroes at launch without having to spend a dozen hours in single player. In this sense, the multiplayer mode of Marvel's Avengers is cunning, because it allows you to tackle each mission in the company of up to three friends, or alone with the help of up to three bots. So at the moment no content would seem precluded to those who prefer to play on their own, and this is undoubtedly an added value. Playing together with friends is obviously advisable, although it is possible to communicate by voice - the only system allowed - even with random users found through the matchmaking system. It is clear that titles like this gain an edge when chatting while beating up enemies, also because Marvel's Avengers does not want to be a phlegmatic and technical action game like a Dark Souls or a Sekiro, but rather a colorful, chaotic button mashing that can be traced back to the scrolling fighting games of the 90s. Nonetheless, Crystal Dynamics has managed to design an interesting combat system: the heroes are extremely diversified in terms of mechanics and individual skills, which can then be further developed by assigning the points earned at each level up in the dedicated menus. If initially the mechanics may appear extremely basic, the scene changes significantly already around level 15, when many more customization possibilities open up which influence not only the individual dynamics, but also and above all the group dynamics. The standard difficulty level of the four that can be selected for each Marvel's Avengers multiplayer mission is never so demanding as to force sophisticated strategies and skill combinations, let alone the farm of objects or experience, but already raising the bar becomes more advisable, as well as satisfying, to seek a synergy between the heroes in the team and the bonuses that give their powers. It is a sensation that is only perceived after several hours of multiplayer and at higher levels, of course, but perhaps the main problem of Crystal Dynamics' vision lies here, which struggles to combine the carefree screen action with the RPG mechanics associated with the equipment, to the growth of characters and factions. In fact, each hero essentially progresses on two floors that remain separate for too long: one is the aforementioned system of customizable skills, the other is the one in which there is random loot, the equipment that we often find in missions and which does not change the appearance of the characters, leaving that task only to the numerous collectible costumes. The look that does not change in the long run becomes the least of our problems: the equipment - individual for each hero, except for some accessories, and impossible to exchange with other players - often guarantees various types of effects, can be upgraded or disassembled to accumulate the necessary resources and improve other pieces. In reality, you will spend a large part of the game pressing the key that automatically chooses the best equipment based on a value that determines the average power of each character, making him more or less inclined to face certain missions. The strategy and micromanagement of statistics and bonuses only finds its place at the highest levels, when perhaps it becomes necessary to wear specific protections or use precise effects against certain opponents. But it's a long way to go, and very repetitive. The multiplayer mode is therefore this: repeat missions after missions to grow each character to the maximum level, then improve his equipment. The variety of content, however, is debatable. The Avengers Initiative is divided into a generous number of missions, sometimes more articulated and divided into different phases, but most take place in the maps already visited during the campaign, reconfigured if necessary. This means that you will meet again soonto repeat tasks that are very similar, if not identical: defeat a certain number of enemies or mini-bosses, protect some NPCs, destroy specific targets, and so on. Once the campaign is completed, the feeling of repetitiveness comes within hours, and it becomes difficult to imagine the same experience multiplied by six times and then for all the heroes that Crystal Dynamics will add over the months. In this sense, we were particularly disappointed by the shortage of iconic bosses at launch, practically only Taskmaster and the Abomination although the Avengers boast a plethora of important enemies that we would have liked to face even on several occasions. On balance, the multiplayer mode of Marvel's Avengers does not deviate from the typical offerings of GaaS; however, although it boasts a team of charismatic, diversified and very fun to play heroes, it too soon shows its side to a loop that can only be satisfying if nibbled and which can get boring in a full immersion for many hours a day. That said, there's no shortage of reasons to keep playing over time. Between comics, costumes, emotes, plates and so on, there are tons of collectibles to search for or unlock in the so-called Challenge Cards, practically a list of individual rewards that reward the growth of individual heroes. This is where the notorious microtransactions come into play, but we want to be very clear: they are really irrelevant. They allow you to purchase the currency needed to buy the rewards in the Challenge Cards in packs without completing the corresponding small tasks, but a little effort and perseverance is enough to take everything without paying a penny. In this sense, the microtransaction dynamics had no weight on our final evaluation. Graphics and technical aspects If the campaign pleasantly surprised us, and the multiplayer has strengths and weaknesses that will weigh differently on the shoulders of different types of gamers, the technical sector of Marvel's Avengers is a completely different issue to deal with, and no less complicated. The look of the Crystal Dynamics game is remarkable, especially in the details, and the 3D models of the various heroes have been animated with over the top care and attention. When we fight as Iron Man, Thor, Cap and so on, we are effectively controlling the same heroes we have loved in the comics or movies. The artists at Crystal Dynamics have painstakingly reconstructed them, reserving some of that diligence for the wide-ranging maps, full of details and destructible elements, and the choreographed campaign sequences that seem to come directly from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But then, when you start moving, and look more closely at the screen, the spell is broken and all those shortcomings that made us think of a rushed release and code that perhaps should have come out between few months. The most striking is certainly the instability of the frame rate which, on a very noisy PlayStation 4 Pro, and by selecting the 4K mode from the options instead of the Performance one, struggles to constantly hold up to 30 frames per second. When it drops below that threshold, it's not catastrophically, but it's still noticeable and happens often, especially in the more geometrically complex maps and especially when the heroes start fighting, throwing up an impressive amount of particle effects. In the spectacular sequences of the campaign that we mentioned above, a noticeable slowdown can be enough to ruin the scene - and sometimes to send Game Over - and it's a real shame: it is clear that the Crystal Dynamics guys have not managed to optimize the code in time for the release, and we can only hope that these problems will be solved in the next updates, also because at the moment we really don't feel like recommending the purchase on a smooth PlayStation 4. Our review of the PC version will arrive shortly, so we will be able to further dissect that technical sector as well. The frame rate, however, is not the only problem to mar Marvel's Avengers, which suffers from a significant amount of bugs and glitches that Crystal Dynamics is slowly trying to solve, but which reconfirm the haste that characterized this release, moreover already postponed at least once. Fortunately, they are minor bugs that rarely affect the gameplay, but between dialogues a little in Italian and a little in English, strange animations, characters who don't speak or who speak with their mouths closed and heads floating in mid-air without a body, the overall picture appeared quite worrying to us. In our judgment, the Californian developer should pass", "date": "2020-09-04", "grade": "7.0"}
