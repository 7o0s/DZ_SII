Furthermore, the case of Virtua Tennis was emblematic because the developers of the AM-3 team were able to transform a somewhat ~niche~ sport into an amazing arcade experience, so brilliant in its simplicity that it did not fear rivals for several years. It is therefore with a pinch of nostalgia that the ~aged gamer~ approaches Virtua Tennis 4, discovering on the one hand with pleasure, on the other with a little perplexity, that the game has remained fundamentally the same since its origins. Back in the hands of AM-3 after the interlude of the 2009 episode, the new SEGA tennis returns in fact the same feeling as always, with the players who do not accuse the fatigue and who therefore can sustain even very long exchanges before giving up in front to a particularly fast and cut shot, or to a volley that catches them unprepared at the net. Furthermore, depending on the ~specialization~ of the tennis player, it is possible to fill a particular bar located in the upper part of the screen and then make a ~special shot~ when it is full: it is not a maneuver that leaves no way out, but it can put the opponent really in trouble. Apart from this little novelty with a distinctly arcade flavor, there are actually few elements that testify to a real evolution of a franchise which today, unlike in the past, finds itself having to compete with a Top Spin in great shape and capable of offering the public enthusiasts the realism they crave so much. The neck is unscrewed, the head is removed Xbox 360 controller in hand, Virtua Tennis 4 immediately reveals itself terribly immediate: while the left analog stick allows us to move the character, the four buttons on the pad are used to perform cut, full, drop and volley shots. Regardless of the type of movement of the racket, our shots will be more or less effective depending on the timing, the position of the player at the moment of impacting the ball and the direction pressed on the stick to direct the shot. Skeptics wait to turn up their noses, however, because these elements alone are not enough to frame the gameplay of the new SEGA product, which needs to be ~digested~ and mastered in its (although not many) facets before you can even win an exhibition match against an established athlete. By the way, there are twenty-one tennis players that we will be able to use for quick matches and within the Arcade mode, the latter set up as a tournament made up of four matches with as many terrains to characterize its performance and a progressively higher level of challenge (l We found the last opponent really difficult). Many of the characters are unlocked as you progress through the World Tour, and ultimately the roster offers a great mix of today's biggest names in tennis and some past stars. Speaking of World Tour, it is one of the innovations introduced by the developers in Virtua Tennis 4, undoubtedly the most substantial given that it is a career mode that develops through five large ~zones~ and sees us engaged in a number awesome of events. The first step is the creation of our player, using preset models or working fine thanks to a fairly powerful and detailed editor; after which you find yourself following a sort of ~game of the goose~ style board, with cards (which can be ~shuffled~ or purchased) instead of the dice. Depending on the card, we will be able to advance one, two or three boxes on the path; and depending on the square we will have to face a different situation, in which tennis matches play almost a marginal role. There are in fact various types of training that allow us to develop the skills of our character, and which see us hit clay plates with the ball, play against an opponent with the possibility of raising net walls, collect chicks on the field and deposit them near a hen without being hit, score a ~goal~ by throwing a soccer ball towards a goal defended by a moving table, and so on. These minigames (accessible directly from Party mode, if desired) turn out to be very nice and varied, but in the end it is the results on the character's performance that push us to face them with piace, given that with each passed test the athlete we have created will become stronger, faster and more resistant. Right left; left right In parallel with the ~physical~ growth of our player, there will be an increase in his popularity based on the number of stars assigned to him, a determining factor also and above all for qualifying for the various tournaments scattered around the map. The movement system, which sees us move ~by chance~ from one square to another, hides more than one pitfall: we could find ourselves skipping the square from which a particular event is accessed, or happen upon a ~malus~ square which makes us lose some stars. Our champion, the Spanish Pierpablo Grecos. These are possible accidents along the way which, however, with a little experience, can be avoided. On the other hand, the implementation in the World Tour of the tiredness factor is very interesting, represented by an indicator that decreases after every public appearance, every challenge and every training session, and which can only be restored by stopping in a ~hotel~ box to enjoy the necessary rest . If it happens to face a game with the condition indicator at a minimum, our player will find himself injured in some way and this will imply a series of limits in terms of mobility and effectiveness of shots. In short, it's better not to let it happen, but the fact that such an event can occur and that therefore we find ourselves having to balance travel, challenges and the necessary physical recovery in the best possible way is certainly a stimulus. Finally, in support of the table and the events we find two particular shops: one, of the conventional type, allows us to buy clothing and equipment to personalize our athlete; the other is more like a sort of advanced course, where you can buy new shots and skills to get even stronger. Virtua Tennis 4 also offers a multiplayer mode, with the possibility of playing our games against the CPU while waiting for an opponent (a bit like Super Street Fighter IV) or entering rooms created by other users to challenge them in a match single or double. The presence of the ranking and the numerous objects that can be unlocked as experience is gained are certainly a strong incentive to continue the online experience, which however seemed to work very well, without episodes attributable to the lag. He rejects on the fly, adjusts a sock Let's go back for a moment to 1999 and the first Virtua Tennis. The game's graphics were extraordinarily fluid, of great impact, but in close-up shots the players turned out to be squat and ~heavy~, with physical structures decidedly distant from the real ones. Ups and downs, therefore, that somehow we find again after twelve years. The polygonal models of Virtua Tennis 4 are in fact graceful and realistic, they move fluidly, boast an excellent level of detail and ultimately convince, but their animation sets are identical, especially during the fast cutscenes between a rally and the other, and we also note the lack of decisive frames when there is a sudden change of movement, with results that are not very pleasant to see. Luckily the highlights are quite spectacular, the ~direction~ of the matches proves to be sufficiently dynamic and finally the rendering of the scenarios is excellent: numerous and detailed audiences, three possible views and an interesting ~tilting effect~ which makes the shot less static than what we are used to seeing in a tennis game. The action is accompanied by a sound sector in full SEGA style, which you love or hate but which basically leaves no mark either for the music or for the effects. The PC version is confirmed to be very light and well optimized: on the test configuration, at a resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels and with all effects at their maximum, we always played at sixty frames per second, without experiencing drops.", "date": "2011-07-12", "grade": "7.5"}
