In an industry that seems to be moving more and more towards a mature and dark approach, the Welsh team proves to be an ideal archetype of the indie developer: ironic, irreverent and undoubtedly stylish in proposing extravagant titles and content. With two games underway, Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims and The 2D Adventures Of Rotating Octopus Character, one of those not-essential but welcome titles arrives exclusively on Wii U: a fairly valid product, ideal for turning on the console between one AAA and another, able to tickle the arcade palate of players of the past. Given the lengthening of the development times of next-gen titles, the perception is that indies are increasingly becoming a delicious side dish, a sort of small status symbol to vainly put on display, very pleasant in the immediate future but unable to become a persistent product in time. Scram Kitty and His Buddy on Rails represents all this, and even more: the Dakko Dakko product embodies the excellent work which, captured by the rampant - we dare say almost Renaissance - publishing cosmetics that is enveloping more and more manufacturers, Nintendo is working to make its eShop a happy home for independent developers. Scram Kitty, despite not using the Wii U symbol Gamepad in any particular way, still finds its way into an interesting mix of platform, shooter and technical arcade. Let's see why. Scram Kitty brings good indie quality to Wii U, despite some questionable design choices Space cats When the cats are kidnapped and taken to a space station, there is no other solution than to arm yourself and set out to find them. Scram Kitty is a rail shooter that is really on rails, as the movement of the protagonist is linked to the curves of the level design and cannot be detached from them except for short jumps. With 29 levels overall (including tutorial ones) and 70 cats to recover, the title provides an average of 4 cats per level, each linked to a completion characteristic. They range from the standard conclusion of the same, to killing a particular enemy, to the time race up to collecting all 100 coins scattered here and there. All combined with precise platform phases that rely on gravity to calculate the drifts in the jumps and R-Type style shooter sections or double fiery spinning jump (Mars Matrix?) In which to make your way through hordes of enemies. The fusion of genres is accentuated by a decidedly difficult degree of challenge capable of engaging even expert players, thanks to a learning curve that is anything but immediate. To advance in the level grid it will be necessary to collect an increasing number of cats, so as to make the progression not a mere reaching the end of the scheme, but something more complex. Naturally, the game doesn't end at the seventieth cat collected, but continues in a sort of survival end-game challenge in which you run at breakneck speed between schemes in which coins increase the seconds counter. It would seem like a hardcore paradise, but a couple of reservations are in order. Pots and litter boxes Scram Kitty works immediately: fun, ironic, draws from milestones of the past, puts a little bit of everything on the plate and does it with style. However, the problem lies in a level design that does not take off and which in the long run appears to be a victim of dj vu, as it is not too varied, limited in ambition and not always stimulating. In addition there is a management of the shot depending on the degree of angle of the character on the tracks: a nice idea that at the beginning fills most of the effort made in playing, but which in the long run declines in the scale of interest and becomes more of an obstacle to fluid gaming than anything else. Much of the frustration in advanced battles derives precisely from having to divide the brain between platforming and calculating the degree of inclination to shoot enemies, with the result that, when it loses playful preponderance, the shooter phase becomes more of a burden than anything else as a visibly secondary element. We are not saying that the realization is insufficient, mind you: simply, the idea of creating such an accentuated combination between curves and line of fire is fun only in the first game sessions and then becomes almost an obstacle to the platform phases, which are the ones that they will acquire more and more weight in the advancement. Another flaw is the complete absence of some sort of online ranking: especially in the end-game phase it would have been nice to be able to compare with the timing of other masters of the platform deThe title Dakko Dakko, but no tables or official statistics. Gamepad or TV? Gamepad and TV pass the ball according to the player's preferences, as they are both zooms of the other, alternating more or less wide view according to their own tastes and needs, by pressing the now well-known Select key. Don't expect unique features or uses of the resistive second screen, there aren't any. U parallax Although purely a stylistic artifice, the depth effect that arises from the background planes creates a small tribute to the three-dimensionality of the current Nintendo portable. Dakko Dakko does not deviate from the typical stylistic canons of indie, choosing to go on the safe but always appreciable sown: relying on a pop-art style and a rather lively techno sound system, the title makes the 60 frames the playful and visual essence . The result is positive, with advanced phases enriched by a few more effects and a playability that responds perfectly to commands, however much they need training. Given the muscles of Wii U, the task is certainly not onerous, but at least there are no slowdowns of any kind throughout the adventure, which we remember to be long. An apparently fast start immediately gives way to a sudden increase in difficulty, with the result that only the first quarter of Scram Kitty flows nonchalantly, leaving the rest of the title with the burden of making you sweat more than seven shirts. Provided, of course, that you master the commands quickly and manage to find that satisfaction necessary to complete each level one hundred percent.", "date": "2014-05-23", "grade": "7.5"}
