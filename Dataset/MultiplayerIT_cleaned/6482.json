In fact, the balance between an ~honest~ freemium product and one that isn't is delicate, and in the case of Dungeon Hunter 4 the problem resided in a balancing of the difficulty that adapted the strength of the enemies to the progress of the character, making almost entirely the enormous work of strengthening carried out between weapons and objects collected in the dungeons is useless. We were therefore faced with missions characterized by an artificial difficulty, all in order to monetize as much as possible through the inevitable in-app purchases. Has Gameloft learned from its mistakes for the fifth chapter? After playing almost half of the rich Dungeon Hunter 5 campaign, completing various levels several times in favor of grinding, we can say that the situation has substantially improved and that this time it is possible to complete the adventure without necessarily having to dip into your wallet . Of course, to do this it is inevitable to repeat some phases and, above all, to take advantage of one of the innovations introduced with this episode, namely the possibility of invading other players' dungeons to steal gold from their chests; at the same time organizing our underground so that it can in turn resist the assaults of some bad guys. Various facets of an experience in which you have to extricate yourself from multiple energy bars and different currencies, focusing on passing from one level of experience to another so that all the counters reset, giving us extra minutes of action. Maybe we were lucky, maybe the choice of warrior and a weapon like the Soul Stone Staff (effective from both short and long range) helped us to take advantage, the fact is that the hours spent with Dungeon Hunter 5 they gave very different sensations than those, often of frustration and impotence, that we experienced exactly one year ago. Dungeon Hunter 5 represents an interesting reworking of the Gameloft action RPG experience Button mashing The class system has been simplified, allowing us to choose a character from three categories but to equip him with the weapons we prefer, using two different slots to alternate as many tools. In our case we had started with a warrior armed with a poisoned double sword, quick and effective in hand-to-hand combat, and a magic stick as a reserve. As we progressed through the missions, however, we realized that the approach from a distance worked much better and exposed us to fewer risks, so we conveniently ~merged~ the swords to enhance the rod, leaving it as the character's only weapon and concentrating on its enhancement. Even the upgrade and crafting system has changed, adopting the now traditional mechanics of fusion between different objects and evolution where a certain degree of effectiveness is achieved. This type of operation requires gold coins, but as already mentioned there is always a way to scrape together some without necessarily having to repeat missions after missions. Speaking of grinding, this aspect of the experience has remained intact, but an interesting variation has also been included here, namely the increase in difficulty for already completed stages, which brings with it not only stronger and more numerous opponents , but also and above all richer prizes, in particular the precious potions for restoring health. Then there is the friendship system, framed in the perspective of an asynchronous co-op in which, basically, we choose another user's character to assist us in battle, using his skills but under the control of artificial intelligence. There is therefore no real multiplayer, but be careful not to reject these implications a priori, because they bring with them further advantages in the freemium area, giving us ~tickets~ with which to redeem chests full of new objects, to equip or to fuse. If we want, the big problem of Dungeon Hunter remains the lack of a complex combat system, in particular due to the lack of the parry, which makes the gameplay a matter of pure strength where instead it would have been the case to reward the skill more . It is possible to perform somersaults to avoid dangers and increase the distance between us and a boss, but in some cases the amount of enemies is such as to force us to button mashing (if we can call it that, considering that the attacks work even just holding pressed the button), resulting in battles that are as spectacular as they are simplistic, the outcome of whichto is determined solely by the level difference. On the technical front, the results obtained by Gameloft are completely similar to those appreciated in Dungeon Hunter 4, even if some design choices leave a little dumbfounded. Let's say that artistically the fourth chapter had made a better impression on us, while in terms of yield and performance the situation appears unchanged and even here there is occasionally some uncertainty that brings the frame rate well below the threshold of 30 frames per second , at least on iPhone 5s. The sound is good, between convincing effects and well-acted dialogues in English, while on the controls front we would have preferred that the virtual stick repositioned itself on contact rather than remaining fixed on the screen, but even so the interface appears precise and responsive.", "date": "2015-03-18", "grade": "7.8"}
