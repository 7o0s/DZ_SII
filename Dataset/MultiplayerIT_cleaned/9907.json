However, what the Apple online store certainly abounds in are puzzle games with colored blocks, Tetris-style, as simple in their concept as they are immediate and intuitive for the occasional player who owns an iPhone. Sigma in particular fits into this prolific trend quite quietly, while offering a slightly different vision of the classic game concept and inserting elements of another great successful puzzle game, Bejeweled. Roll that passes you The game interface in Sigma is already the first interesting novelty compared to what has been seen so far: in fact, it will be necessary to slide two rollers of colored bricks with your fingers, placed on the sides of the screen and separated by a wall; the only communication space between the rollers will be given by a central slit, capable of letting one block pass at a time in both directions. The final aim will obviously be to gradually eliminate the ends of the blocks closest to the wall, joining the bricks of the same color in groups of three or more, horizontally or vertically. To transfer the blocks from one roller to another through the slot, simply turn the mechanism, place the small square with the appropriate color in the center and touch the ~sender~ side with your fingers; the other part, ~recipient~ of the block, will in turn have to be moved until it finds at least one pair of blocks of the same color, position it in line with the slot and thus create the conditions for elimination. Once familiar with the touchscreen controls, everything will take place in a fraction of a second and very naturally even if, due to the excessive sensitivity of the controls, it will often happen to start the blocks inadvertently or to move the reels out of time: nothing that a little practice can't limit, however. As the number of blocks exploded simultaneously increases, particular bonus bricks will be granted: the bigger the ~combo~, the more powerful the bonus granted will be, which starts from the simple destruction of a row of tiles up to the cancellation of the entire part of the reel displayed on the screen, joining seven blocks of the same color and thus activating the ~nuclear bomb~. Three game modes can be selected right from the start: Sectors, Time Attack and a simple Multiplayer mode limited only to comparing the scores obtained; the difficulty levels available in the options will be three as usual, namely casual, normal and difficult. In the Sectors, equivalent to a sort of arcade mode, six levels (corresponding to the first six letters of the Greek alphabet) must be overcome to unlock all the available themes of the game. To advance in level it will be necessary to accumulate as many points as possible, the progress of which will be indicated by a line placed above the screen, but at the same time the maximum time must not be exceeded; this trick gives a bit more anxiety in the course of the game, which will therefore reward a more intuitive approach than the reflective one typical of puzzle games. Unfortunately, little to say about the unlocked levels: in fact they change only for the color rendering and the effects of the explosions of the blocks, but they do not implement any significant novelty in the gameplay. The Time Attack will allow you to challenge yourself to improve the points record in one, five or ten minutes, after which the game will end in any case; Finally, the multiplayer, which can be activated both via bluetooth and wifi, will be limited as mentioned to a mere comparison of statistics, as it is not possible, for example, to send malus to the opponent after a combo of particularly numerous bricks. The degree of general difficulty, starting from the normal setting, offers a good level of challenge only in the last stages, especially due to the lack of time available in performing the combos; on a difficult level, however, the problems will begin even earlier, again due to the narrow time limit. On the technical front, as always, the speech must be evaluated considering the category to which Sigma belongs: the graphics are very simple but without any problems. The themes, which vary as already mentioned only for the color palette used, are not all completely successful, however given the necessary haste with which a scheme must be tackled, they will certainly not be priorities of interest to the player. The fairly anonymous background audio is fortunately fully customizable and will therefore be possible to listensing one's own songs, a function that is particularly welcome and not always exploited well, given the particular vocation for music of the Apple terminal. Finally, like many other titles by now, the Plus + achievements manager will also be present here. The tested version is 1.1 App Store links", "date": "2010-07-13", "grade": "7.2"}
