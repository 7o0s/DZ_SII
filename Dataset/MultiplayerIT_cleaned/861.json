The path to obtain revenge is not linear at all, we will be able to decide how to get to our objectives by varying our behavior at sea from time to time. During navigation, it will be possible to attack ships, dock and plunder ports, collect bounties, destroy the enemies we will encounter or capture their vessel and expand our fleet, and so on. All this translates into the possibility of replaying the title over and over again, obtaining always different matches also based on the choice of one's nationality and consequent alliances that will be modified assault after assault. finish in about 15 hours of play, has a great addiction factor on its side: very often you will find yourself continuing to play, precisely because the objectives are never extremely distant from the point where you are, and at the same time each mission is not never too long to complete. A pinch of strategy.. There are many different types of ships and vessels available in Pirates, from the smallest ones to huge battle galleons. One of the interesting aspects of the game is also linked to the management features for resources and for planning battles at sea. For example, enslaving enemy ships will require more personnel, which will lead to increasing our reputation as a pirate, but will also increase the demands for food and treasure division among fleet members, to avoid mutinies. At the same time in marine battles we will have to evaluate different aspects, such as the number and category of vessels that will attack, based on our offensive capacity, or we will have to take into account the wind direction to obtain tactical advantages, and still decide the type of attack and weapons to use, to attempt a boarding or to destroy the ship with cannon fire. One of the interesting aspects of Pirates is also linked to the management features for resources and for planning battles at sea This new test by Sid Meier, however, is not limited to clashes between fleets in the open seas, but offers numerous subgames and more or less scripted interactive events. Giving the idea of the many mechanisms that animate the game is not simple, but to give some examples we can mention the various fights with bare hands in the inns or with the sword drawn against the captains of other boats, in an attempt to conquer them. These situations have a series of pre-established events and endings, but to complete them and obtain a victory we will have to resort to our reflexes, by pressing the different keys on the pad according to the sequences that will appear on the screen. By getting the sequence right, we will hit our opponents, and after a few phases of combat we will win the fight. We will find a similar situation in other phases of the game, specifically during grand galas, we will be able to dance with the lady on duty, often the daughter of some influential character, and if we respect the right times, winning the girl's graces, we will obtain interesting rewards. .. expressed in the form of bonuses, objects, clues or anything else useful for the various missions. All this to give the idea of a truly unusual structural variety. Pirates, compared to the PC version, has undergone some changes, some of a technical nature, such as the lowering of the general resolution of the game, others of a practical nature such as the change of view during particular game sessions, or the different angle of the camera in other . The same goes for the cutting of some redundant elements to adapt the title to the immediacy and practicality of use typical of Console productions. The Xbox version, however, also enjoys the balances made based on the feedback received, with a different balance of difficulty, the correction of some bugs and above all the inclusion of an entire multiplayer section, absent in the PC version. The Xbox version, however, also enjoys the balances made based on the feedback received, with a different balance of the difficulty, the correction of some bugs and above all the inclusion of an entire multiplayer section, absent in the PC version The multiplayer in Pirates, possible up to four players, is not a secondary addition, indeed as simple as its conception may be, in practice a clash between vessels in different arenas, it is extremely fun and well done. The speed and modality of the clashes between vessels turns out to be different from the single player campaign, and first of all it changesthe speed of action, clearly higher, to better adapt to this type of game. It is also possible to insert one or more ships controlled by the CPU, in order to balance or make the clashes in the available maps even more unpredictable. In this regard, it must be said that there are not many multiplayer arenas, but their conformation is designed in such a way as to be able to exploit the characteristics of the maps to obtain advantages in battle. The downside is that there is no Xbox Live support for multiplayer, but only for support of any Live Aware add-on content and features. Speaking from a technical point of view, Pirates, while not getting the prize for best graphics production on Xbox, defends itself fairly, also thanks to the artistic style used. In particular, the creation of the seas and the clashes between the Caribbean waves are well implemented aspects, leaving other sections of the game a little subdued, such as certain clashes on land or certain animations during some subgames, which turn out to be decidedly wooden. The frame rate in marine battles is always stable, there are some slowdowns in a couple of subgames, but they don't particularly detract from the action. Note of merit for the soundtrack which is certainly spot on for the atmosphere of Pirates! Comment Sid Meier's: Pirates! turns out to be, even in the Xbox version, a title that should not be underestimated. Its most important positive sides are the high replayability factor and the variety of action during the unfolding of the main campaign. Speaking instead of the aspects that would have been better developed, apart from the technical realization that could be decidedly improved, we find two main suspects: the presence of too many scripted sections in the subgames, and in certain fights outside the Caribbean seas, and a lack of development of multiplayer via Xbox live. A must for lovers of the pirate world in general, which they will find in Pirates! one of the funniest titles in the genre and a product that lends itself best to accompanying the sunny August afternoons during the holidays. Pros: Replayability Atmosphere Multiplayer well done Cons: Some obvious graphic limitations Too many scripted situations Lack of Live support for multiplayer To keep us company during the summer season, a very special action adventure is coming to Xbox. Remake of the original Pirates! dated 1987, and at the same time port of the version landed on PC at the end of 2004. We were talking about a particular title, in fact it is so, the new Pirates has fully maintained the charm of its first appearance on PC, obviously adapting to the new technical and aesthetic standards . The background is simple, after having properly customized our alter ego, assigning him various skills, it will be the time to set sail in the Caribbean seas with a well-defined goal, revenge. Get justice for a governor who years ago ruined our entire family by imprisoning them. During the course of the game, therefore, we will find particular missions and targets that will lead our neo-pirate step by step to reunite with his loved ones, putting a spanner in the works of the bad guy on duty.", "date": "2005-08-03", "grade": null}
