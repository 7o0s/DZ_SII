After spending dozens of hours with the Overkill Software title on PC, we approached this new incarnation with a bit of distrust, aware of how often reductions on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are complicated for less developed development teams noble, despite an architecture that on paper should maximize conversion operations from the Windows platform. Well, unfortunately the graphics of the game confirmed our fears, unable to reach a frame rate higher than 30 frames per second (thankfully rather stable) and therefore deliver that fluid and reactive ~gunplay~ that one would expect from a first person shooter of this genre, in which you often have to shoot against relatively distant targets. Fortunately, by increasing the sensitivity of the view it is possible to obtain a decent compromise for the use of the DualShock 4, otherwise afflicted by an unbearable latency, which makes it really difficult to hit the target if not relying completely on the even necessary aim assist. But let's go in order... Despite the somewhat subdued graphics, Payday 2: Crimewave Edition is a rich and solid shooter We have a bank Four professional criminals collaborate with several mysterious figures, who plan increasingly complex heists for them. This is the idea behind Payday 2, which in the Crimewave Edition is enriched on various fronts: new characters in addition to the starting quartet, new clients, new missions and new objects, with a view to a structure that immediately reveals itself solid and multifaceted. We will be able to start with simple chores, for example burglarizing some shops in the center, and then move on to more complex operations, such as emptying safety deposit boxes or even attacking the vault of the most important bank in the country. The possible final reward will change depending on how (and if) we complete each mission, and will allow us to purchase new weapons and equipment in order to be more effective during firefights, as well as more resistant and responsive when we are attacked. By gaining experience and leveling up we will also obtain skill points to be used to unlock extra skills linked to four different classes, each with its own specializations: some focus on stealth and make medikits available to survive as long as possible, others concern the technical aspect of burglary and explosives, still others transform us into a war machine with devastating power and infinite magazines. We will be able to choose the type of character we want to be, especially after becoming familiar with the philosophy of the game, but everything will have to be placed in the perspective of a team that will necessarily have to find its own balance in order to obtain good results. Four under a skull Payday 2 is a cooperative-based multiplayer shooter, which can be played alone with the support of artificial intelligence (not very brilliant) but which, of course, only gives its best when we select missions from the server and interface with other users . It may happen that you find yourself in a team of novices who don't know how to behave in certain situations, catch the player who stays still or the one who leaves prematurely, however the planning characteristics (especially in the more advanced missions) and work organization do not go well with this kind of eventuality, making for a frustrating experience. Luckily during our tests (obviously carried out with the game out and the servers open, also to have the real pulse of the functioning of the online sector) we came across a few episodes of the kind, indeed finding a surprising number of aware users waiting for us, perhaps with already a few hours behind on the old-gen version of the game. The approach to the games can be varied, it is possible to try to carry out a coup without triggering even an alarm, therefore by carrying out various preliminary explorations and neutralizing security systems and guards, or not giving a damn, wearing the ordinance mask and opening the fire as soon as theunfailing emergency response teams. To aim for stealth, however, it is essential to move within a close-knit team, preferably made up of people we know. In fact, we will have to respect deadlines, operate with precision and in an organized way, as well as put the specializations we mentioned earlier on the plate in order to be able to open doors and safety deposit boxes in acceptable times. Playstation 4 trophies The forty-three Trophies of Payday 2: Crimewave Edition are divided into two categories: on the one hand those that are obtained simply by completing specific actions for the first time, on the other those that require the completion of different actions than usual, and which therefore you actually have to plan during the games. This type of setting makes achievements quite interesting and fun to get. Imperfect crime The perplexities on the front of the technical implementation that we expressed at the beginning of the review concern the general picture of a product that was originally published two years ago, and that even on PC did not shine for the definition of the graphics, much less for the quality animations or for interaction with the scenario. It is clear that revising certain limits after a long time, moreover without an adequate frame rate to patch it up, can only reiterate the now consolidated gap between first party development teams and those that do not enjoy the same collaborative relationship with the hardware manufacturers. Of course, the shared architecture in this case should have made a difference. Beyond this aspect, as mentioned, discreet but far from brilliant, Payday 2: Crimewave Edition stands out for an effective and engaging soundtrack, as well as for an online sector that in our experience has proved to be solid and free of uncertainties. with the usual somewhat excessive timing for entry into the game but without episodes of lag or glitches worthy of note.", "date": "2015-06-14", "grade": "7.7"}
