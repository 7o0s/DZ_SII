Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. When it comes to space-based action shooters for iOS devices, the first title that comes to mind is Galaxy on Fire 2. However, there are also other productions of great quality and interest , maybe with less thickness but equally enjoyable... maybe free, like Quantum Legacy. Available on the App Store since February, the game developed by Miles Godspeed can be downloaded and installed for free on both iPhone and iPad thanks to the universal format, it has recently been updated to support the Retina Display of the new Apple tablet and stands as a sort construction site, which from update to update is enriched with new elements that make it progressively better. Furthermore, if in your opinion it is a worthy product, it is possible to purchase a 79 cent ~token~ via in-app purchase to support the work of the developers, a team made up of three people who for over nine months have been creation of a shooter which, as we will see in a moment, has all the credentials to conquer a large number of fans. The protagonist of Quantum Legacy is a shrewd star pilot, engaged in a series of clashes to free a space sector from the disorders that have been undermining its livability for years now. In practice, no space is dedicated to narration, which turns out to be one of the few limitations of the game, and we immediately get down to business: within a certain number of levels (currently four, but new ones are added periodically) the our goal will be to identify and eliminate threats, whether they are moderate-sized ships or huge vessels equipped with turrets and advanced defense systems. Hits here, hits there The fulcrum of the gameplay lies in the fights rather than in the exploration, and from this point of view the interpretation offered by Quantum Legacy has a clear arcade flavor and simplifies things a lot, giving up a whole series of features that could have made the experience even more fun and multifaceted. In any case, the firefights with the other spacecrafts are engaging and well represented: our spacecraft can lock on to its targets via a touch on the screen, approaching them very quickly if they are at a certain distance, while the turn is managed by tilting the device and thus exploiting the integrated accelerometer. u Once engaged in a fight, we must act on the buttons located at the ends of the touch screen: the one on the left activates the energy shield, the one on the right activates the homing weapons. All equipment can be upgraded by unlocking new items between missions, and even this aspect has seen changes over the weeks, with the addition of new tools that are even more effective, such as deflectors that return to the sender enemy bullets. Winning a challenge becomes a matter of timing and precision, in particular you have to activate the shields at the right time to avoid overloading them and do the same with the cannons, dosing the maneuvers and trying to ~read~ the opponent's offensive in the best possible way. shift. The technical sector is really excellent, even more so if we consider that the game can be downloaded for free and without any limitation: the polygonal graphics are defined and precise, with a good design for the spacecrafts and space stations and equally good light effects, while the atmospheric musical accompaniment and the dialogues (in English) complete the work.", "date": "2012-04-28", "grade": "8.0"}
