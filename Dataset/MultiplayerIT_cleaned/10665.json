{"name": "Missili sul Live Arcade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68654-rocket-riot-missili-sul-live-arcade.html", "text": "Shoot'em up on just two axes is a particularly popular genre in recent years, reborn from the ashes of arcades and 16-bit consoles to find a new home within the welcoming walls of the Xbox digital delivery service 360 and Playstation 3. From Geometry Wars onwards, a race has therefore unleashed for the best reinterpretation of mechanics that are not new but of unbeatable immediacy, immediately amusing and perfect to be adapted to products to be sold at low prices; Codeglue, the developer, and THQ, the producer, have therefore decided to have their say and jump into the fray with this Rocket Riot, on sale exclusively for Microsoft consoles via Xbox Live Arcade, a variant on the theme that is little publicized but absolutely worthy of consideration. Missile riots The action takes place in rectangular environments, moving a funny character and trying to kill enemies or complete the proposed objectives. Nothing to tear your hair out of at first sight, but it's after a few minutes of play that you begin to understand the originality of a product that primarily focuses on consistency, making driving your alter ego equipped with a jet pack more difficult as it is subject to gravitational attraction and the opposite acceleration, and then complicating things thanks to the possibility of interacting, destroying, with each element present on the seabed in a colorful orgy of constantly moving 8-bit-style boxy images, with several enemies trying to find their way to the skin of the player and a load of power ups - the classics, from the upgrades of the paraphernalia up to momentary immunity from blows - not indifferent. All along a sixty-level single-player campaign, often focused on the request to eliminate all opponents on the screen but also capable of clashes against some bosses and strokes of genius such as a reinterpretation of American football and that of ~Water, fire, little fire!~. The control system based on two analogs and a trigger lends itself to being mastered in no time and overall the experience flows fun, suffering from a certain repetitiveness only towards its conclusion. Finished properly Set aside the main mode, some delicious side activities will remain, above all the classic option to play a game during which to resist as many waves as possible, playable even the local with three friends. Competitive multiplayer instead ranges from team and non-team deathmatches to the more original request to survive wearing a special golden livery, without being able to shoot and with the opponents all engaged in acquiring that special status. Nothing sensational, but an interesting diversion. Technically, as already mentioned, the developers have gone back to the 8-bit era, coloring the screen with three-dimensional shapes and figures - against a scrolling always in 2D - more or less complex but always with a good impact. The audio is less exciting, which however does not annoy and is lost in the explosion of visual stimuli.", "date": "2009-06-30", "grade": "8.2"}
