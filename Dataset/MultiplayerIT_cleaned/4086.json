In truth, the title in question is the sequel to a game released before the famous shooter by Studio MHDR for Xbox One and PC, which inserts Bendy in a sort of franchise capable of ranging even between quite different situations and atmospheres, given that the previous (and little known) Bendy and the Ink Machine is even a sort of subjective horror, which arrived last April on Steam. Considering the amount of time taken by Cuphead to arrive on the market after its first presentation it is possible that the Joey Drew Studios team has still drawn inspiration from the work of the Moldenhauer brothers, but let's leave the benefit of the doubt, recognizing if nothing else a remarkable ability of variation on the theme, at least in terms of gameplay. From a subjective pseudo-horror, in fact, Bendy's new adventure is a sort of ~endless boss runner~, so to speak, in the sense that it is an endless runner mechanic applied exclusively to boss fights. The perspective is typical of many titles of the genre: framed from the front, with the boss chasing him inexorably from the background, the protagonist finds himself running on a pre-established path with the possibility of following three parallel tracks, jumping from one to all 'other at any time to try to reach the bonuses and especially avoid the attacks. It is a game mechanic that is entirely based on the speed of reaction within a limited set of possibilities and solutions, as befits an endless runner, but declined according to a very peculiar taste, which makes it distinguishable in the midst of the boundless quantity of titles of the genre in the mobile sector. Run and jump The control system is based on simple touches on the screen, the classic ~swipe~ that allow you to move the character to the right or left on parallel tracks by moving your finger in the desired direction or jump by moving it upwards, all you need to run on the pre-established path and try to avoid the attacks of the boss chasing us in the background. In the midst of all this it is also necessary to collect weapons of various types scattered around the levels in order to throw them at the enemy, trying to reset his energy and thus win the battle from a distance. The application of the endless runner mechanics to a succession of boss fights of this type represents a good intuition on the part of the developers, who have thus managed to create a rather convincing variation on the theme, as well as having found a way to characterize every single level is very particular, which becomes a sort of direct challenge against an incumbent enemy. From this point of view, the shot in front of the protagonist also finds a good application, which at first may seem disorienting in a game so focused on reactivity, but soon proves to be necessary to always put the boss at the center of attention. Beyond any starting points, there is no doubt that Cuphead has represented some source of inspiration, as also demonstrated by the composite structure of the boss fights: although the levels generally do not offer a great variety of situations or variations on the theme , there are different phases that intervene in the clash with the enemy, which tends to assume different configurations and behaviors as the battle progresses, making it particularly engaging in this way. The graphic style adopted mixes 2D elements with other 3D ones with an interesting scenographic effect, even if we are quite far from the marvels staged by Studio MDHR, which derives from the obviously different dimensions of the two productions. In any case, that is enough to give a strong and specific identity to Bendy in Nightmare Run within the mobile landscape. The game is a free-to-play that makes extensive use of in-game currency, represented by cans, to unlock new levels, modes and accessories to customize the protagonist, but these are elements that can all be conquered simply by playing, seen that the cans are scattered throughout the levels, so the system seems decidedly balanced.", "date": "2018-08-31", "grade": "7.8"}
