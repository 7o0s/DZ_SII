Even with an effort, rivers of video games go unnoticed by our eyes, risking making us lose experiences that, instead, should have been tried and made known to as many people as possible. This is the case of Opus: Echo of Starsong, a narrative adventure distinguished by puzzles and RPG elements which, above all, stages an unforgettable story, one of those that have no borders. Indeed, they go beyond their own to speak to anyone at any time. In its mix of genres, in which even simple 2.5D exploration phases alternate, Opus: Echo of Starsong slowly reveals a plot that transcends time and space, whose most precious lessons are the difficulty of learning to love and accepting yourself while living your life, without depending on the judgment of others. A bittersweet story, because it starts from the future to go back and recall a past that is now too distant, with the regret of those who have done everything but perhaps not the only thing that matters. We reviewed Opus: Echo of Starsong on PC and we can't wait to tell you about it. A story that transcends time and space Opus: Echo of Starsong, let's retrace the story through the memories of the old Jun The game opens with a now old man who is about to explore a cave that has remained untouched for decades: he is a respectable head of the Lee clan, too important a figure to allow himself such a risk, as he is repeatedly told. He sends all these protests back to the sender, declaring that he is no longer anyone but himself, and continues. Use a strange object to unlock the heavy stone entrance, a staff from which comes a song. Among his words, filled with regret, we read that he has returned to fulfill a promise made to a woman many, too many years ago, something he was unable to do then and wants to keep at least now. It is among his memories of sixty-six years before that the story of Opus: Echo of Starsong takes shape, telling us and reminding himself that the bonds forged during a journey like his can transcend the boundaries of time and space. There's always a bittersweet trace when we find ourselves reliving someone's memories, the knowledge that something went wrong but we have no idea what and, piece by piece, dread the moment when we discover the truth. The story staged by the Taiwanese studio SIGONO is as beautiful as it is moving and builds in intensity until a bittersweet conclusion. It tells of a young Jun, exiled together with his guardian Kay for having dishonored the clan and looking for a way to restore the lost honor; of his fortuitous encounter with Edalune (Eda) and Remi, two girls linked by something deeper than blood, one a witch and the other a skilled pilot. Against the backdrop of a science fiction universe that is dealing with the aftermath of a terrible war, fought for the possession of a mysterious and powerful source of energy called lumens, people who couldn't be more different from each other will find themselves collaborating after an incident with a group of pirates. Opus: Echo of Starsong pays a lot of attention to the lore, both through the numerous exchanges with the many characters who populate the game world and through the numerous collectibles (two hundred and forty-six) that we will be able to collect during the adventure. Opus: Echo of Starsong, Kay repeats the oath made to Jun when he was a child The developers' commitment to creating such a vibrant universe, even in its misery, deserves every single word read, but basically it is commendable for the construction of the characters. Their depth and characterization is built step by step, also relying on flashbacks that shed light on their past and help to make certain situations even more tragic and heartfelt. The altercations between Remi and Jun, the latter's suffering for being responsible for the collapse of his entire clan, Eda's obsession with someone she can't forget, Kay's devotion to her young master: they all have something that defines them, making them unique in their own way, multifaceted in their being no longer simple characters but virtual people: with an experience, a goal, strengths and weaknesses, in a constant series of situations that helps paint a clear picture of what it means to endure the difficult consequences of the War of the Lumens. The game is not localized in Italian but, if you know even a little English, don't miss the opportunity to immerse yourself in the story of Opus: Echo of Starsong. There is no rush to travel it, you are left with all the time in the world to readand explore, even in the face of a rather simple gameplay but varied enough not to let such a touching story slip adrift. A simple but captivating gameplay Opus: Echo of Starsong, Jun prepares to use his scepter to proceed Despite being a game that makes storytelling its cornerstone, Opus: Echo of Starsong also offers a good variety in gameplay: none of its elements, puzzles in particular, can be said to be difficult, but the presence of RPG elements combined with exploration makes it interesting, especially when we consider the randomness with which different events can occur. Starting from the puzzles, they are all structured around the use of so-called ~starsongs~, songs that only witches like Eda can produce after hearing the voice of the lumens. Registered in special scepters called Echo Synthescepters, they allow you to interact with ancient technologies that exploit the lumen as an energy source: sometimes it is a question of conveying the aforementioned energy simply by using the scepter while others, specifically when you find yourself in front of entrances from to open, you have to find the right rhythm by aligning the sounds with the symbols on the door. In some cases it may happen that two different samples of starsong are needed, prompting us to look around to find the missing one, but beyond this it is a very simple interaction, to be seen almost more as a small break within the narrative flow. On the other hand, however, we have its RPG structure to make it captivating. We are in a solar system and we are runners looking for lumens, exploring anomalies or unknown areas is the first thing to do as soon as you wake up: here resource management and ship development come into play both to make them travel greater distances and to resist the dangers or pass unscathed some tests that require the tampering of external signals. Each point of interest on the map requires specific units of fuel to reach, which in turn is obtained by buying it in settlements or by superficially exploring the ruins (i.e., without having to dismount the ship and switch to a 2.5D exploration). To do this they are however, specific kits are necessary, which in turn can be purchased in the settlements: going unprepared means only wasting time and fuel. What we will find is random, it could be used both to upgrade the ship and as a bargaining chip: trade is one of the main activities we will carry out in the game, because resources cost money, they are consumed faster than you think and we must always be ready to replenish in order not to find ourselves in unpleasant or disadvantageous situations. This means planning trips, deciding whether it is worthwhile to immediately drain an area of all its resources or keep something aside in case of future need (resources do not regenerate, there are a certain amount of attempts available and that's it) but, more importantly, be ready for anything. Opus: Echo of Starsong, one of many explorable areas We have no idea what awaits us upon arrival or during the journey, since random events can occur both on site and en route: generally these are threats to be overcome by hacking into other people's systems or distorting the signal, a choice that is left to hand to us and above all to the game, should we choose to take the risk. Each action has a specific difficulty and, based on the power of our means, the result oscillates between one possible extreme and the other: it's like rolling a dice, which can be modified during the game to have a higher starting result of 1. The impossibility of accurately predicting the result, as well as any reward obtained, is what makes each event unique in its own way and this applies to any type. From dangers to tests of luck (as regards Jun), coercion (in the case of Remi) or diplomacy (Eda), everything is left to chance which, however, can be slightly bent by obtaining or purchasing objects that increase the starting value below which we cannot go down. These events, combined with occasional secondary missions and above all multiple choice dialogues that determine most of the exchanges, constitute the RPG component of the game, which is joined by the slightly more managerial one when it comes to the ship , its upgrades and careful consumption of resources to move from one fixed point to another. There is so much to explore in Opus: Echo of Starsong, and contrary to what one might think it can last at least ten hours if you are explorers curious enough not to miss any corner of the galaxy. In its simplicity, the gameplay is engaging and diverse enough pTo keep the attention span always high, but the core of the game still lies in the story, in the messages it tries to convey. Opus: Echo of Starsong, a very personal moment between Eda and Jun We have already written it and we repeat it, the care taken in the construction of the setting and the characters shows all the heart of the developers: from each png we are able to obtain valuable information on the game world, on the life of those who survived the war or were born after its consequences, managing to grasp all the hope and resilience that lies beneath the desolation that reigns. Jun, Jay, Eda and Remi's journey is fascinating, especially in the way it is shaped against the backdrop of political machinations far greater than themselves; their characterization is accurate, as well as the concept of family that is created in being members of the same crew. A dive into memory and the past that is linked to a present, a bittersweet ending in which, however, you can feel the same warmth and hope of the past. Artistic sector Opus: Echo of Starsong, the relationship that is slowly being built between Eda and Jun is among the best parts of the game The aesthetics of Opus: Echo of Starsong is very well done, with visual novel phases that alternate with animated 2.5D sequences and well-finished character artwork, but the audio sector is the real strong point of the game. The sound design is utterly memorable, even outside of the puzzles where it does a great job of conveying emotion. The traces you will hear throughout the adventure are variations of the starsongs used to proceed, more elaborate versions capable of creating a perfect atmosphere. It's hard to find real faults with Opus: Echo of Starsong, but one thing actually made us screw up the nose: the lack of manual saves and the need, for automatic ones, to complete sequences that may even be quite long. If we want to exit the game and go to the main menu we are not asked to save progress and, although the autosave is frequent, it is always advisable to make sure that it appears on the screen: otherwise, we risk having to redo a portion of the game already addressed. Beyond this, the work done by SINOGO is absolutely worthy and is among the many indies that you should not miss.", "date": "2021-09-25", "grade": "8.8"}
