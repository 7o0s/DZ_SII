{"name": "Star Wars: Starfighter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-starfighter-6.html", "text": "Many years ago, in a galaxy far, far away... One of the qualities of the game is perhaps the most sought after: the plot is really well thought out. Set in the final era of the Republic, our adventures will place us on more than one occasion in the context of the events narrated in ~Episode 1: The Phantom Menace~, and the constant feeling of deja-vu is undoubtedly pleasant, however of the classic saga could regret the lack of a villain worthy of the name (the bevy of robots of the Trade Federation boasts very little of the charisma of the Stormtroopers of the Empire...). In any case, the narrative plot is as follows. Once the invasion of Naboo by the Armata Droid has taken place, we will find ourselves dressing the space suit of Rhys Dallows, a talented aerospace cadet of the Bravo squadron, assigned to protect Queen Amidala during her escape from the planet. Unfortunately, once the escape of the sovereign has been ensured, ours will find himself isolated and will undertake his personal battle against the Federation in the company of the bounty hunter Vana Sage and the infamous space pirate Nym, who will put aside their rivalry to settle the respective outstanding accounts with treacherous Merchants. As we pass the game missions, we will not only find ourselves aboard the agile N-1 Starfighter, but we will also impersonate his two companions, each of whom is in command of his own personal combat spacecraft. Ready to take off It bears repeating: Starfighter is not a new chapter in the X-Wing saga, but the quintessential arcade game. To be played strictly with the pad, in addition to the directional arrows, two weapon keys and a couple more as ~accelerator~ and ~brake~ are sufficient to have full control of Rhys's lean fighter or Nym's mighty bomber; the simple and essential interface ensures a rough monitoring of one's own and enemy's shields, but lacks any navigation system, radar or maps, so it may happen that you have to do more than a few turns on yourself to ~targetize~ the right targets. A limited interaction with the crews of allied ships is possible, requiring cover and assistance in flight, but the poor readiness and limited tactical awareness of the allied units will force you most of the time to do the job yourself. Of particular interest is the presence of operations both set in space and others in the atmosphere of different planets, which involves some small variations on the theme of the trivial ~seach & destroy~. For example, Nym's ship is equipped with very powerful missiles which proceed in a straight line in space, proving to be useful for knocking down larger and slower ships, while near the ground they will fall following a parabolic trajectory, allowing the just and brutal extermination of the troops enemy earthlings. In such situations the interface ~evolves~ showing an additional crosshair that takes into account the direction and the inertia force that will influence the fall of the bombs. Unfortunately, the physical model remains rather approximate and the only difference that you will be able to catch while fluttering in the air of a planet rather than in absolute vacuum, is that in the first case, once you reach a certain altitude, you will crash into the usual invisible wall , just as it is completely indifferent to fly upright rather than upside down: in both cases our spacecraft will ensure that we remain suspended in the air like soap bubbles, without stalls or aerodynamic loads of any kind. In short, they really want to make our life easier... Tell me the AI you have, and I'll tell you what game you are... From the point of view of artificial intelligence, there are no big surprises: the only initiatives that the enemy fighters will take will be to shoot you when they have the opportunity and to stupidly ram you if you find yourself face to face along the same trajectory. The rest of the movements, the events and the appearances of ships, hostile or allied, are scripted, pre-set, granitically programmed until they are frighteningly repetitive, also considering the number of times you will have to repeat the most difficult missions. In fact, the most classic of consular legacy videogame stressors is not missing: the automatic save at the end of the mission. Do you have to take down the core of a giant droid factory, but not before disintegrating 117 power generators that control the deflector shields? We're sorry, but if you die after destroying the first 116, you'll have to start over. That's how life goes. Sound's Good Even relying on the home GeForce settings to push thelimits the potential of an engine that is actually quite poor, Starfighter confirms itself as belonging to that first generation of PS2 titles that are not graphically very exciting. After all, a year has passed since the console version was released and the weight of time is felt. Not that the graphics are that poor, but the quality of the 3D models is fluctuating, as is that of the textures and in 2002 it would be reasonable to expect that the walls of the mountains do not seem cut with an ax and that the fighters explode their fragments in the sky instead of vaporizing in a bang and a puff of smoke or plummeting to the ground without a trace. Moving on to the audio, we can truly be satisfied, also thanks to the free and pleased use and abuse of the ~official~ sound effects and audio tracks of the Star Wars hexalogy. Unfortunately, the hand of some voice actor is never missing, not particularly inspired by his part who interprets the most dramatic dialogues with the same pathos as when he recited the multiplication tables. In truth it is not such a poor localization and some characters, such as the alien Nym, are voiced quite well, but the quality to be such must also be constant. What happened to the unforgettable dubs of Dungeon Keeper, Warcraft2 or even just the recent Max Payne? In recent years we have mostly witnessed real havoc both vocal and grammatical (Baldur's Gate2, Black & White etc.). At this juncture we are not at such low levels, but a minimum of extra effort would have safeguarded at least that little bit of ~atmosphere~ that this game has the pride of giving away... otherwise leave the titles in English as you do first.. . Conclusion Are you an avid Star Wars fan? Have you recorded the movies on TV, bought the ~Second Edition~ VHS, the Episode 1 DVD, the RPG and the trading card game? And maybe now you are looking for a nice video game on the subject? Well, steer clear of this title, buy yourself Jedi Knight 2. If, on the other hand, you are simply fans of the series who want an unpretentious arcade toy, rough in its construction, but with a captivating plot and you are willing to overlook the frustrations of method of saving and on the fact that objectively 14 missions are a bit small, then you could think about it. And may the force be with you. The Neverending Story Historically, the Star Wars brand has been among the most exploited in the world of video games, and it's not even worth listing the countless amount of titles that have made use of this greedy license. Suffice it to say that excellent quality products (Jedi Knight and its recent sequel or the controversial X-Wing Vs. Tie-Fighter) have often been accompanied by as many complete fiascos, in this case as many as have appeared on the shelves in conjunction with the release of a new chapter in the film saga. Well, within which of the two categories presented does Starwars Starfighter fit? Before continuing, it should be pointed out that SS is not the space combat simulator that Star Wars fans have been waiting for for years, but rather a fairly conventional arcade conversion from Ps2, which embodies the stereotype of the ~console game ~ for which the traditional PC user tends to feel a certain aversion.", "date": "2002-12-13", "grade": null}
