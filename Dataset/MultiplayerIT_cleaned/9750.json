The particular simulation sensitivity of the Milanese software house has produced a title that puts us ~on track~ in 13 races around the world, all duly licensed with multiple races and special stages, giving us the opportunity to get on board not only the very powerful cars of the premier class, but also the more docile ones of the lower categories. I'll pimp your car! The game offer is very vast in addition to the career called ~the road to the WRC~, we will find the academy, made up of 12 events to start getting familiar with the cars on the different types of background, the championships and the individual tests unrelated to the career, totally configurable to our liking, the hotseat mode, a sort of local multiplayer in which up to four players take turns taking turns on the times, and the real multiplayer, with the possibility of choosing a championship or single rallies to go through. Undoubtedly the heart of the game is the career, structured on a system of experience and credits. The first grows by overcoming the victory conditions, for example by placing us in the top three, winning at least one or more trials in the meantime, and with the progression it will unlock the various competitions that make up the seasons. The latter are the material compensation for our successes, they are used to buy new cars, useful not only for having more performing vehicles at hand, but also for participating in single-make events, and for allowing us to make the vehicles real ~harlequins on four wheels ~, buying over time liveries (about 40) and paints to be applied to the bodywork. The aesthetic tuning ends with the choice of the sponsor. The better our results will be, the better sponsorship opportunities we will have, the higher the income will be at the end of the championship. However, the impact of these modifications is only accessory in the economy of the game, there are many paints and liveries but they are certainly not something of high quality on which to waste time to customize the car according to one's tastes. In short, a well done homework just to put a nice check on the paints and decals item. There are many races to face, just think that the road to the premier class is made up of ten championships, each of which brings a minimum of four to a maximum of six events, which between special stages and ~double rounds ~ they can even reach six rallies each. In short, there's really something to sweat about, you grind kilometer after kilometer, but what to do in small doses, because obviously the tracks tend to repeat themselves (some rallies are unlocked rather late in the career), a certain feeling of repetitiveness is very strong, however mitigated by the different versions of each individual race, six in total, with many different mileages and the obvious back to back. Milestone Dealership In the same way, Milestone has included a large group of cars, obviously licensed by the various federations, and which reach sixty units, all available in single player mode, while in the career the unlocking will follow the progress of our performances. Different types of cars are available, in addition to the basic distinctions between two/four wheel drive and turbo, and not counting the WRCs we find the Super 2000s, the P-WRCs and the J-WRCs, the latter designed for drivers aged up to twenty-seven . Before going into detail on the driving model, it is important to describe the possibilities that Milestone gives us for configuring our gaming experience, in terms of various aids and assistance. The settings are quite basic: directly accessible from the main options or before each race, the menu allows us to configure the assisted braking and assistance to the brakes and stability, the type of transmission, the damage, heavy or light, and the level of the opponents, if possible the most important option of the whole game. Our advice is to remove all the facilitations, enter the academy and then throw yourself headlong into your career. The game succeeds in never being too punitive towards the player, the transition from the ~docile~ initial cars to the surly and slippery WRC is rather ~sweet~, diluted over time by the enormous number of competitions and intermediate cars that they wait. The enormous sense of satisfaction in bringing a car to success on the most disparate surfaces is however trivialized by a balancing of the level of difficulty which often appears random andnot too consistent with race events. Winning easy Since there are no direct opponents in the race, everything is played on the time available to complete a course. In practice, for the most part, everything seems to have been calibrated low, with intermediate times, even full of errors that do not always condemn us to the bottom of the standings, we pass naturally from the tenth position of the penultimate section to the podium with discards too high, given that it is possible to pass, for example, from five seconds behind to five seconds ahead within a kilometre. So this also penalizes the driving style, once we understand how the title works, we will stop restarting a race after the first unsuccessful kilometers, given that there is still the possibility of finishing in the first places at the end. It is possible to remedy this problem by raising or lowering the difficulty level as we like, which is therefore good to keep it at at least 70%, but basically, barring macroscopic errors, it is quite frequently possible to obtain excellent results. This impression is also the result of damage management, which also seems to be not very punitive. This doesn't mean that frontal or suspension shocks don't affect, far from it! the car breaks down, falls apart and very realistically denounces our inability to drive in terms of performance, however it takes a long time to break down and only at the end of the session will we find ourselves with the car symbol all yellow or worse still red. The yield of the damage is therefore optimal, the car embarks, the engine croaks and does not push properly, too bad it is a little late, and consequently very permissive. Instead, we liked the meticulous management of repairs during multiple events that pushes us to decide what to repair depending on the time available. The tuning of the car is equally well done, with a good number of parameters to play with. Xbox 360 goals WRC rewards the player of the 50 available objectives with 1000 points. The easiest achievements are achieved with simple progression in the game, with minimal victory or unlock conditions, simply by using the various possibilities that the game offers. Many achievements also concern the online sector, while the toughest ones ask us to get to the end of the game on the top step of the podium. Strengths and many technical defects The driving model is quite good, but it too is affected by the problems listed above. The cars, whether they are the hyper-modified small cars from the beginning of their career or the very fast WRC cars, respond credibly to the stresses of the various road surfaces - even if the differences between the various types of track are very clearly felt only in the most extreme conditions - and it is clearly perceived the detachment between the cars, with the first decidedly affordable and less grumpy, while the second accomplices burning accelerations and very high speeds really put us on the tightrope, making us forget the ~walks~ without spinning at the beginning of our career. Everything therefore plays on small corrections on the stick and on the partialisation of gas and brake, no braking or closures of sudden curves, in short, you remain glued to the monitor trying to hit that tight hairpin or that fast section full of obstacles, sometimes placed in an almost criminal way, ending with a nice hairpin bend. More generally, Milestone has done a good job of trying to make us experience realistic driving sensations, a pity, in short, inserted in a context that sometimes penalizes a slap-top driving model. From a technical point of view, WRC alternates some things well done with others not in step with the times. A stable frame rate, a bright and bright color palette, and a good use of hdr and particle effects, are counterbalanced by a decidedly not exciting detail and polygonal construction, especially as regards the edge of the track. The impression is that the game does not seem to excel in terms of pure resolution, and it is not uncommon in courses where there are trees and relative shadows on the road, or in those at sunset not to understand where the road is, lost in a jumble of kneaded and poorly defined textures. Furthermore, the pop-in is continuous, for a global impact that will certainly not be remembered in the coming years. The cars are made a little better than the rest and are appreciated for the progressive dirt that accumulates on the bodywork, and as previously written, for the good yield of damages. On the other hand, the level design is good, each track is never trivial, between dirt roads, gravel, cobblestones, mud, snow, ups and downs, parabolic curves, ravines, bottlenecks and the most insidiot of the road surfaces, the very slippery asphalt, which, wet or not, makes even the most dirt road look like a peaceful train ride.", "date": "2010-10-08", "grade": "6.8"}
