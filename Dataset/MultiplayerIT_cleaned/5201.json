{"name": "Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/taiko-no-tatsujin-rhythm-festival-recensione.html", "text": "Long gone are the days when the series known as Taiko no Tatsujin was relegated to the Eastern market. And luckily. Of course, it is impossible to restore the context of the arcade rooms on consoles - in which the gigantic drums to be used with special sticks were physically present - but why deprive players from all over the world of one of the most intuitive and fun rhythm games ever? Thanks to the arrival of Nintendo Switch, Taiko no Tatsujin has also arrived here since 2018, with the release of Taiko no Tatsujin Drum 'N' Fun. Four years later, Bandai Namco tries again with Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Nintendo Switch Festival. However, only the basic rules remain the same, because from a quantitative point of view the developers have really aimed high, offering what on balance is the most full-bodied, rich and varied chapter of the series; not to mention that finally it becomes possible to compete online with your friends or with other players from all over the world. Gameplay: the usual (but always solid) Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival: The main offering is enriched with the Ghost Mode Music games are unlikely to overturn their rules over the years: take Just Dance as an example, which has been practically identical for more than a decade now. If the formula works, there is little to innovate, even if it certainly can always be filed or refined. In Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival the rules have remained the same as always. The newcomer can choose to hold a Joy-Con in each hand, and simulate the use of the Japanese drum (taiko) by playing the Don (red) and Ka (blue) notes at the right moment when they appear on the screen. Apart from minimal variations, such as the ~drum roll~, which allows the simultaneous use of both instruments, the system at the basis of the Taiko no Tatsujin series is this, without tricks and without deception. The aim is therefore to complete a whole piece of music among the 76 tracks present (and possible variations), being careful not only not to miss the notes, but also to play them at the right time, because the overall score is affected: by reading ~good!~ on the screen you will understand that you have accumulated more points than a modest ~ok!~. And if you can't get anything but ~bad~, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have no sense of rhythm: perhaps you have miscalibrated the motion sensors. As with the previous episode, Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival can be played, as well as with the drum contained in the physical edition, also with the Nintendo Switch touch screen or with the two Joy-Con (although it is less precise in the latter case). Better then, in our opinion, to opt for the classic control system based on traditional keys; after all, it is clear that the other input modes are those designed for casual players or for those who simply want to have fun without too many thoughts. But switching to ranked matches online, or playing songs on ~hard~ or ~extreme~ mode (the two most difficult, as well as ~easy~ and ~normal~) you'll want to opt for the most effective input system at your disposal . All those who want to train will find in this new chapter the brand new Ghost Mode, which allows you to repeat specific sections of certain songs to the bitter end, or those parts in which you just can't alternate don and ka as you should to get the full score . History Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival now boasts an original story mode, and we're sure you'll enjoy it An adventure mode or a small story, however small they are, practically never clashes. Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival proves that this is also true for music titles, enriching the package with the addition of its own cute story mode. Each performance grants taiko points, which can be spent to advance from chapter to chapter in the narrative, which gives an additional incentive to repeat the same songs over and over again. The protagonist of Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is Don-chan, the red drum, who arrives in Omiko City with the intention of training and becoming a true Taiko Master. In the city - which is divided into various places, highlighted in the main game menu - he will meet Kumo-kyun, a new character capable of taking on different forms depending on the places visited. Kumo-kyun will also be Don-chan's new personal motivator, and will accompany him on his climb to success. Advancing from chapter to chapter, the player will be able to watch small scenes between the various characters (all on colorful two-dimensional backgrounds, as per tradition), unlock unreleased songs created by Bandai Namco specifically for Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival, get new cosmetic items in the town shop (must be purchased with coins, also earned by completing songs, along with taiko points), and much more. Lots of game modes One of the new modes of Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival The game modes of Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival constitute the heart of the entire offer: if in the past there was only the taiko mode, in which the songs to be played were chosen and one was limited to performing them one after the other, now it will be possible to choose from a much more varied range of offers. In our opinion, the most significant introduction is the Great Battle of the Drummers, also known as War of the Toys, in which not only the very particular style of Taiko no Tatsujin can come back to the fore with all its energy, but it is also enriched with minimal elements roles. This is how you play: first of all, your own toy box must be composed from scratch, in the first moments using those proposed by Kumo-kyun, then drawing from those that can be purchased in the shop. Each box features a leader and then individual smaller toys, each of which possess a specific ability; a cost is also attributed to each one, and the box as a whole cannot exceed a certain threshold, which thus limits the choice of toys and their balance. Once the toy box is organized, one begins to play according to the classic rules of Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival: but the positive execution of the notes allows this time to deploy the toys on the battlefield, which - in addition to making numbers against those of the opponent - will also release specific skills that will embarrass the rival, inverting his notes on the screen, speeding them up, obscuring them, and so on. The player with the most toys deployed by the end of the song wins the game; toys being equal, drum rolls are counted. The beauty is that the Great Battle of the Drummers is just a ~story within a story~, a small micro-plot within the main narrative. Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is more colorful and fun than ever But we could continue for hours to tell you about the news of Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival. The Don-chan Band, for example, allows four physically present players to play together in an impromptu concert: subject to the usual rules, each one will control a specific instrument of the band, so the single performances will be decisive to ensure the success of the performance choral. Then there are the online modes, in which it is possible to challenge unknown players to the best of two songs, or for longer, and the casual matches obviously alternate with the classified ones, organized in real leagues that are gradually more and more demanding. You can also invite your friends, or choose to challenge your rivals on the network only on specific songs, the so-called ~battle songs~, on which you feel more knowledgeable. In support of everything we have illustrated to you, the shop allows you to modify not only Don's ~body~ and ~head~, but also the online greetings and farewell phrases, as well as placing a small companion alongside him. However, not everyone will appreciate the purchase of the online pass in the form of a subscription, which allows you to unlock hundreds of additional songs.", "date": "2022-10-29", "grade": "8.5"}
