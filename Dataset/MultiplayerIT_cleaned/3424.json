{"name": "Overwatch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/overwatch-recensione-switch.html", "text": "For someone who has spent 1200 hours on Overwatch - don't judge - on PC, the first impact with the Switch version is traumatic to say the least. Accustomed to the precision afforded by the mouse and keyboard at 60 frames per second, holding the Joy-Con at half the frame rate is a compromise that few would be willing to make for the pleasure of playing Blizzard's team-based shooter everywhere or, at least, where it takes the Wi-Fi signal. The guys from Irvine have already brought Diablo III to the Nintendo hybrid console with excellent results, but Overwatch is a completely different animal and a conversion for hardware like Switch was a huge challenge to tackle. A challenge that Blizzard has only partially overcome, and in a particularly uncomfortable moment, with Nintendo itself rowing against it due to the Blitzchung debacle. In short, let's see how he fared with this conversion in the next few lines. The conversion Assuming that an examination of the game dynamics, already widely discussed in the review phase at the release of the title and periodically reviewed with each important update, is not needed, we prefer to immediately dispel any doubts about the most relevant issue: the appearance of Overwatch in Switch version. Well, Overwatch runs at 900p with the console in the Dock and at 720p in portable mode, but the resolution is dynamic in both cases and scales depending on how excited the situation is on the screen. Playing on TV, the qualitative decline appears more evident, but it also occurs in the most chaotic moments, for example when several Ultras start at the same time or most of the twelve players in the game gather around the goal for a direct confrontation. To succeed in the enterprise, the guys from Irvine had to make obvious compromises. The game runs at a level of detail comparable to the minimum/medium quality in the PC settings and this means that some visual details were lost in the conversion: some shadows, some particle effects, blades of grass and other scenic objects in the corners of the maps . The textures are in low resolution, of course, and some shaders are missing, such as the reflections on the hair or the costumes of some characters. They are small sacrifices that are not even noticeable in portable mode, in truth, but which inevitably become more evident if you play on the TV and know Overwatch well in the previous incarnations for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Despite this, the Switch version lacks an absolutely fundamental detail, namely the frame rate which, unfortunately, does not always remain perched on the promised 30 frames, but loses a few frames in the most chaotic clashes and in structurally more compressed maps. Let it be clear that we are not talking about inexorable collapses but about small interferences, and yet even when it is maintained at 30 frames one cannot help but feel an annoying sensation of delay which certainly does not help in a frenetic and dynamic shooter like Overwatch. Those who have never played it before at 60 frames, for example on PC, will notice this discrepancy less, and this is one of the reasons that leads us to advise against its purchase to those who can enjoy it on more performing hardware. For the avoidance of doubt, Overwatch on Switch isn't a disaster, just a decent conversion. Blizzard has managed to preserve the artistic identity of its creation in all respects, without retouching or degrading the character models, the physics, the structure of each map and all those details that embellish this best seller. Fortunately, the colorful cartoonish nature of the game compensates for these deficiencies on the visual front, where in a realistic title they would have caught the eye more easily. Playing it in portable mode, for example, the aforementioned problems are barely noticeable, net of an interface that can be a bit intrusive on the tiny screen. Either way, it's a really weird feeling to hold Overwatch in the palm of your hand. Even the sound sector, which is very important in a game like this, has been re-proposed in its most complete clarity, with the Italian dubbing audio package to be downloaded separately and the functional integrated voice chat that does not depend on the pathetic Nintendo app. The subjectivity of controls Even the game dynamics have remained intact, although some logistical flaws have emerged that are difficult to contextualize. Beyond a discrete but predictable slowness in loading, we have noticed a ferocious lag at the beginning of the game which delays the appearance of the polygonal models around us. Aware that it could be a connection problem - we remind you that you must be connected to the Internet and have paidor the monthly subscription to the Nintendo service - we did several tests and frequently encountered the same hitch in the kill cams, as well as the character change, while every other system connected without any problems to the Wi-Fi network at maximum speed. Whether it's server congestion seems unlikely, given that we happened to wait even several minutes before the system found us a seat in the game, although the length of the queue varies depending on the time of day. There is something, however, that affects the fluidity of the game and its enjoyment, in short: calling up the options menu to change a setting on the fly in the middle of a fight generates an evident delay, especially if you play with the console in Docks. In this regard, we want to reiterate a concept that is not so obvious: playing Overwatch on Switch is not exactly the best way to enjoy the Blizzard title. The problems discussed so far, to a greater or lesser extent, however affect a less than ideal control system by its nature which seemed to us to give its worst on the Nintendo console. Let's be clear that this wasn't our first rodeo and we've played other console shooters without a mouse or keyboard before - the most recent Borderlands 3, but also Doom for Switch - but it was really hard to find a vaguely ideal configuration on Overwatch. The problem is that Blizzard's shooter employs so many buttons at once that the default settings controversially distribute across the controllers: it goes without saying that if you want to press the B button to reload your weapon while aiming with the right analog stick, perhaps while activating your Ultra associated with the X key when you are dancing the lambada between the opponents' bullets with the left stick... well, it's not exactly the best of practicality. It should be noted that the options screen offers a plethora of different parameters that you can generically customize or save for each individual hero, and we recommend spending some time in the training area trying out all the possible number combinations of sensitivity , aim assist and so on, but even after playing the game on the Pro Controller we couldn't help but regret the accuracy of the mouse and keyboard - a feeling exacerbated by the aforementioned frame rate. The unprecedented gyroscopic control system devised for this Switch version left us dumbfounded. Much less precise than what was played in Splatoon 2, it can still represent an alternative for those who want to try a different experience but it has caused us quite a few dizziness. It goes without saying that you should completely exclude it if you play in portable mode, unless you want to shake the whole console like a madman; paradoxically, the gyroscopic controls seemed more valid when playing heroes with a lock-on weapon like Moira or Symmetra, totally useless in the role of hitscan characters like Widowmaker, Soldier-76 or McCree. But the evaluation of the control system is something extremely subjective, mind you, and while emphasizing the delays, the not always constant frame rate and all the rest, it would be better to try the game before buying it to understand if there is a configuration that does the your case since in Overwatch, all in all, you shoot from start to finish. In this sense, it is important to clarify that the Switch package includes the game in its most recent incarnation, including all the maps, modes and, of course, the heroes released for free up to now. This means that, launching it these days, you will find the Halloween event in progress and Sigma, the latest tank to be added, together with the recent Role Queue that has caused so much discussion in the community. A community that remains horrible but which, fortunately, Switch users will not be forced to endure in chat. On the other hand, we would have liked to have the possibility of crossing our new profile on Switch with the one played a lot on PC and therefore inheriting costumes, sprays, victorious poses, highlights and so on: although it is possible to connect to an already existing Blizzard account , profiles maintain completely distinct progressions, and that means forfeiting all rewards unlocked on PC or other consoles.", "date": "2019-10-20", "grade": "7.0"}
