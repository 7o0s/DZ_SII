Among others, Warhammer Online was already shaky, while World of Warcraft was starting to lose some shots, now in the final cycle of its second expansion. At that time, in short, NCsoft faced much less aggressive and varied competition with a theme-park MMO that had already enjoyed success in Korea: the trick was to adapt it to the western market, purging it of all those too oriental characteristics both in mechanics and in the setting, an intention that made Aion immediately very popular. Unfortunately this work of ~Westernization~ was not carried out with great skill; in fact, the game maintained various ~hardcore~ characteristics, especially in the advanced stages, which made the community turn up their noses just as the competition became fiercer. Especially the Blizzard MMORPG with its third expansion and the adoption of the free-to-play model of Lord of the Rings Online. Despite the promises of a great future with promising trailers and timely updates, the Aion user base has dropped to the point of leading NCsoft administrators to evaluate the now increasingly widespread F2P subscription: already active for a few weeks in Europe and soon also in America, this model allows you to play Aion completely free. The question at this point is: is it still worth it? Atreia and surroundings From a purely technical point of view, Aion is still today a decidedly over the top production that powerfully expresses the classic, somewhat baroque and excessive style of Korean artists. The world of Atreia is made up of two separate hemispheres, the bright land of Elysea and the dark lands of Asmodea, connected by a pillar known as the Tower of Eternity: this structure broke following a powerful catastrophe, generating a central area called the Abyss, where spacetime is distorted. The player begins the adventure in one of the two hemispheres, depending on the race chosen: the process of creating the alter ego is really satisfying and the parameters to customize your Elyos or Asmodean are many. The somewhat effeminate bearing of the male characters, a typical feature of character design in Korean productions, makes the nose turn up a bit, while the sinuous female counterparts are among the sexiest in the MMO scene. Of course there is a main storyline made up of specific quests that play the role of ~guideline~ in our exploration of the game universe; in general, however, the player is the classic pawn chosen by fate who ~ascends~ to the status of Daeva around level 10, gaining a pair of wings that will allow him to glide after a jump, take advantage of the air currents to cross some zones or, quite simply, move 360 in the Abyss, always keeping an eye on a timer that indicates the maximum duration of the power of flight, which can be extended through equipment and potions. The flight mechanics offer less exploratory freedom than it might seem outside the Abyss, on the other hand the geographical structure of the various locations soon reveals itself to be complex and well thought out, offering large spaces made spectacular by a remarkable attention to detail and enchanting plays of light . In short, from a technical point of view, Aion has little to envy to the competition, thanks also to a good optimization of the CryEngine which seems to struggle, however, in the presence of numerous players involved in some pitched battle: the spectacular nature of the clashes, the complexity and size of the creatures, especially of the most important bosses, combined with the exaggerated but spectacular animations, make the hours of play a pleasure for the eyes. The free-to-play model adopted by Aion is based on three types of profiles that offer services of different quality. The new accounts, called ~Starter~, limit the use of the game by preventing, for example, the use of some chat windows or the trading system; players who have already paid for Aion in the past are considered ~Veterans~ and can have practically unlimited access to the contents, except for some privileges enjoyed only by ~Gold~ type accounts, i.e. those who subscribe to a 9, 99 a month: among these there is a reduced recharge time for dungeons and various bonuses to the points earned in PvP and PvE. Kill & collect The player approaches the world of Atreia in a way that is not at all different from that of a typical ~theme park~ MMORPG, led in an organic way towards specific hubs where it is possible to talk to NPCs on duty to receive and complete quests that are not particularly brilliant for originality. In effectfetti, the quests soon become a bit monotonous due to the insistence placed on collecting objects or killing numerous creatures in different places, practically the main objectives of the game. Some quests, especially those related to the main storyline, require a party of two or more players to complete successfully but the rewards, in any case, are generously represented by money, experience points and new pieces of equipment. Compared to the version released on the market in 2009, the current Aion client offers a much greater number of missions and while requiring literally tens of millions of experience points to reach the highest levels, the need for sad and repetitive grinding has been greatly reduced , thanks also to the introduction of numerous instanced dungeons that it is possible to face in company or, in some cases, even alone. In short, the gist of the game is the combat, against monsters or other players, and in this respect Aion performs well by proposing very interesting mechanics and a decidedly well-structured battle system, although certainly not very original. Each archetype chosen at the beginning evolves into a real class at level 10, so there are eight possibilities offered to the player who can thus decide whether to specialize in melee or ranged attack, defense or healing; each class then has its own unique skills, learned by consuming the related tomes that can be purchased every two levels. So far there is nothing really surprising, except for the way in which the skills and spells connect to each other in real sequences that the player must manage appropriately since some ~combos~ offer multiple outcomes and side effects. The clashes are therefore visually interesting but also equipped with a good strategic depth: the combat system becomes more complex as you level up, learn new skills and customize your arsenal with Stigmas, stones that you can equip to use additional skills. Beyond the lackluster and linear dungeons to be repeated to exhaustion to obtain the necessary equipment then to face the PvE endgame contents for raid-groups in the canonical, repetitive weekly farming process that now characterizes 90% of current MMORPGs, the main stimulus in In short, Aion should be the Player Vs Player around which the entire game is practically structured starting from the moment you set foot in the Abyss. Gangfest The Abyss features a series of strongholds that can be contested by two factions of players, to which is added a third faction of NPCs called Balaur, whose purpose is mainly to balance the forces in the field. The Abyss is therefore inhabited by enemies of all kinds and by players of both factions who force us to always be on guard, aware of being able to be attacked at any time and from any direction: Aion's PvPvE, based on the acquisition of increasingly powerful and elaborate skills and equipment, it is the strong point of the game but also its main Achilles heel since we soon find ourselves having to juggle between quests designed to encourage PvP clashes and bands of players, perhaps from the same Legion ( term with which the canonical guilds in Aion are identified), whose sole purpose is to make life impossible for those who find themselves in the Abyss even just for PvE. On the other hand, even the portals that open randomly in the game areas and lead to the land of the opposing faction only serve to encourage battles between players: in short, Aion is a game designed above all for lovers of group PvP and perhaps in possession of a system powerful enough to handle the most confusing pitched battles with dignity. Despite the changes made to the balance between the classes and to the Abyss points system, not much has changed in these two years in a structure that is based above all on the accumulation of resources, whether these are the Abyss Points or the simpler Kinah, the unity monetary of Atreia. We noticed a few tweaks, but in general we have to admit that we were once again put off by the sheer amount of money required for the simplest tasks, let alone buying a new pair of wings or one of the vehicles that will come with the upcoming version 3.0 of the client. The economic system, in fact, is in turn based on the usual auction house and on the objects churned out by the commercial professions which require no small amount of effort to be upgraded to a decent level. In short, a strong component is still rooted in the gameand hardcore undoubtedly associated with the Korean nature of the title, a feature with which it is not easy to come to terms with despite the beautiful armor and fairytale settings. The intrinsic repetitiveness of the concept and the endgame can therefore disappoint players less accustomed to PvP with little time available, especially if they prefer to play alone.", "date": "2012-04-03", "grade": "7.5"}
