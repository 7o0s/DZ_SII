{"name": "Twisted Metal: Black", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/twisted-metal-black_a.html", "text": "At the cinema at home The first thing that strikes you since you turn on the Ps2 is the care taken not only in the actual game, but in the interlude scenes and menus. The adjective black placed there on the title is the index of the reference style of the game: gloom and dirt (not in the sense of filth) are the two main parameters of the game. Choosing the credits from the main screen we see a summary of the whole game: cast and credits are displayed with the characters that appear and disappear as already seen in Seven, while the images of the game in a small window are now accompanied by the entire Paint it black by the Rolling Stones, only mentioned at the time of the start menu. After admiring the cinematic introduction (the song by the Rolling Stones is remembered above all for being included in Full Metal Jacket) let's go on to describe the actual game. The 1 player mode is quite devoid of possibilities, we can choose History, Challenge and Resistance: the purpose of the three modes in a nutshell always remains to be last man standing, the last one still alive; there are three multiplayer modes, you can challenge each other up to a maximum of 4 players, with or without bots. That's all. Summing up T.M.Black is really the closest thing to a deathmatch with an fps on pc, if only because it is played on the controller originally designated by the programmers, and this is no small thing. Audio-Video Let's go in order and let's start talking about graphics: let's say right away that the title performs damn well. Immediately in the vehicle selection screen, the particular look of the vehicles catches the eye, which if I am not mistaken is very reminiscent of Judge Dredd and the good old Loaded for PsOne: the cars are dirty and overmodified as if they were a fifteen year old tamarro struggling with the development of the Vespa, the respective owners then seem to have come out of the worst prisons, or asylums of the nation. Chosen the medium we would be thrown into a vast arena together with seven other competitors, who, like us, will dart and shoot as hard as they can. The framerate is constantly at 60 fps and even in the busiest moments, that is almost always, it never drops. After being amazed by the screen update, it closes and reopens after being amazed in front of the very distant horizon that the Incoging title offers: it is not just a question of seeing the end of the straight 800 meters further down as in an excellent racing game, here instead entire valleys or suburbs are displayed, full of details, at the constant framerate that we know without resorting to fogging or clipping of various kinds. The textures of the arenas are excellently made and full of detail, while those of the cars are even more well made, although they cover not excellent polygonal models, they are very detailed and full of details. The special effects (light and particles) of the weapons and explosions are also of excellent workmanship, and are always present while playing, in fact we are constantly surrounded by fumes and trails of various rockets launched by who knows who. A very important thing not to be underestimated is the almost total destructibility of the arenas, which in addition to being important as many buildings hide various bonuses, has forced the developers to produce textures also for the interiors or for the ruins; needless to say that they too do not betray the high quality standard of the title. We also add the weather that changes during the course of the clashes with excellent results, especially that of the pouring rain. The audio sector is also very respectable: the sound effects are all different for each weapon, and what is very important, the soundtrack liberally cites that of famous films. An example is the use of samples of the music used in The Terminator in the battle scenes between humans and robots, in the first level, which actually recalls Cameron's film. Playability and conclusions The excellent playability guarantees fun right from the start, but in the long run it is not without flaws. Let's start immediately by saying that T.M.B. it is easy to master and even using practically the whole pad, it is played without problems from the first game. Not being able to count on the strafe key to avoid direct hits, an exaggerated handbrake has been implemented which, when combined with the use of the rear view, still guarantees excellent defensive results. The number of weapons at our disposal is large, but they all gave the impression to me that they all produce the same effect, exceptnor for devices that are completely different from each other: a fire missile from a homing homing seem to me to behave in the same way. Having said that, let's say that the greatest value of the game lies in the frenzy and total tussle that the title unleashes: it's all a mess, if you pass me the term, from start to finish, the opposing cars whiz by you, not caring about the coachbuilder's bill , while maybe from the mountain 500 meters from you someone is launching a volley of land-based missiles at you worthy more of a tank than a simple armored car, armed and fast as lightning. In short, you won't stand still for more than a second, being always a potential target by enemies, you will constantly turn around looking for new houses to smash and weapons to collect. Talking about the physics of the vehicles is extremely counterproductive, there is no point and that's it: the vehicles stop almost instantly, then make sensational drifts that if we were in a normal game we would have overturned 50 times. There's no complaining anyway, that's right: the Incoging game is totally arcade, consequently aileron incidence, load and tire compound are totally banned parameters. Progressing from victory to victory, the game unlocks new cars and arenas, a classic of all racing games, without exaggerating in terms of number. The sore points, however, are represented by the game itself as such: walking around, exploring, shooting and running away in the long run gets boring. Fortunately, the difficulty level is set to high enough levels which guarantees a long challenge, but in the end having seen everything, you will only take it back to challenge human opponents. Summing up, Twisted Metal Black turns out to be a good title, absolutely extraordinary in the audiovisual field, especially from a technical point of view, but also for its cinematography. Unfortunately the very nature of the title, deathmatch with drifts towards a cooperative mode in multiplayer, undermines its long-term usability: the simple search and destroy does not make it deep enough to keep for a long time, but this was known, however in its own way a great title. Playability and conclusions Pros: Fluidity, excellent graphics and sound Strong cinematography of the title Cons: In the long run boring Repetition Deathmatch on four wheels Eventually the Twisted Metal franchise also made it to the wastelands of Euroland. First of all, it must be said that the wait has been amply rewarded: before going into the review, let's start by saying that we are facing a good title. For those who haven't heard anything about the title, indeed for those few who have slept in the last 5 years, Twisted Metal Black is the closest thing to the bloody deathmatches that take place on PC. The only differences are: 1) we don't impersonate Christians or strange beasts but cars (there is little difference anyway) 2) instead of blood there is an impressive series of fumes, lightning and various explosions. The game is all here, both in single and in multiplayer, the aim of the title is to wander in the immense arenas and shoot everything that moves, paying attention to the attacks of others and what is not secondary to pick up and find if necessary various bonuses and weapons .", "date": "2002-01-02", "grade": null}
