{"name": "Tenchu Z - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tenchu-z-recensione.html", "text": "It's not easy being a Ninja The Ninja is by definition an expert in military strategy and intelligence techniques which take the name of ninjutsu and which have a long history in feudal Japan of the Edo period (1601 - 1868); it is therefore necessary to immediately distinguish his figure from the bloodthirsty warriors made famous by an infinite number of films, manga and anime dedicated to the Japanese Middle Ages: in reality, the Ninjas have always represented a sort of special military body, almost secret, hidden but lethal. The practices adopted are refined and non-invasive: the Ninjas have always been trained for dangerous stealth missions, just as happens in this Tenchu Z. The practices adopted are refined and non-invasive It's not easy being a Ninja Through the game we are called to face about 50 levels of increasing difficulty, starting with a full-bodied tutorial useful for us to practice with the ancient ninjutsu techniques. From the outset it's clear how this game makes the most of every button on the Xbox 360 joypad: there are so many actions that can be performed, and it won't be easy to tame them all in a short time. Many commands are performed by pressing several keys together, a factor which tends to increase the difficulty in managing manual dexterity on the pad. However, a true Ninja is capable of countless moves, techniques and the use of any weapon, so with a fair amount of courage we learn everything and start the first mission. You really have to be ~ninja~ to master Tenchu Z! Sneak, hide, kill. After the first twenty minutes the frustration caused by the cumbersome controls begins to diminish and slowly the pad returns to our dear old friend. Between one level and another we will spend our time in the Ninja village (which in multiplayer acts as a lobby), where it is possible to buy objects, weapons, potions, and equip them before leaving. The village is also the place where we can change clothes, increase our skills and abilities, as if it were some sort of RPG; inside a small house resides Rikimaru, the old protagonist of the past Tenchu, who from time to time will assign us the dangerous missions to face. Tenchu Z is a sort of cross between a Ninja game and Metal Gear Solid, a medieval-Oriental stealth game in practice: it is therefore recommended not to face enemies head-on, in a brute and defiant way, but trying to make us notice the bare minimum, crawling, hiding in bushes, branches and stilt houses, running between the roofs of the wonderful traditional buildings and popping out behind the bad guy on duty. Tenchu Z is a sort of cross between a Ninja game and Metal Gear Solid, a medieval-oriental stealth game Sneak, hide, kill. The paraphernalia available is the classic of every film dedicated to these masked ~heroes~: there are obviously the little stars shurikens, knives, swords, bows and arrows, straws to breathe under the surface of the water, grappling hooks to climb walls and potions caterers. The variety is certainly not lacking among the objects, too bad it is much less fervent as regards the missions to be performed. Most of the game takes place according to a well-established and linear scheme: enter the house, hide (and possibly kill if you are discovered), locate the boss and take him out. On the other hand this was the task of the Ninjas, and Tenchu Z, as an entertainment product that it is, does not give itself the luxury of dreaming a lot with the imagination, strictly following the script that wants them to be very cunning killers. A fearsome game interface Since after the first missions you begin to have decent control over the actions that can be performed by the joypad, the programmers have seen fit to increase the difficulty coefficient in understanding thanks to the inclusion on the screen of one of the most complicated HUDs ever seen. For those less accustomed to acronyms, the HUD would be the graphical interface of any video game, or more commonly everything that is ~overlaid~ in the game. Here we find numerous indicators, starting from the meter of life, very common in all video games. Just below there is a box where symbols gradually appear that draw our attention to particular situations: the ~Ki-Meter~, as it is called, is used to tell us if we are in the field of vision of an enemy, if someone has heard us , or sensed our smell (in this case it will be necessary to dive into the water to return to a calm situation), or it still signals us if a character is alerted or has noticed us. Was there perhaps a need for a superimposed ideogram to communicate the fact of having someone in front of us? A fearsome game interface To underline the complexity of these controlsi there is also a particular icon that should inform us of the fact that ~we~, and we underline ~we~, have noticed the presence of an enemy: perhaps there was a need for a superimposed ideogram to communicate the fact that we have someone in front of us ? Continuing the rundown on the HUDs on the screen, under the ~Ki-Metro~ we find a stealth indicator which indicates the presumed difficulty of the enemies in locating us: the more well hidden we are, the greater the size of the Kanji. Below again, here comes the noise indicator, which constantly informs us of the amount of noise we are producing. Perhaps using a slightly more sophisticated sound sector there would have been no need for a logo to understand how many decibels we are emitting with our steps. A Ninja's AI is an important factor It is therefore clear that Tenchu Z is a real ~simulator~ of Ninja, rather than an action game in the true sense of the word. We are far from the frenetic action of a Ninja Gaiden, but also from the immediacy in the controls of any Metal Gear. It will not be uncommon, during the missions, to find ourselves having to perform fundamental actions in order not to be discovered and to get everything wrong due to the wrong pressure, because at that moment perhaps the right combination had slipped our minds. Practice is the way to victory, as bushido teaches, and Tenchu Z is a perfect ~Try & Die~, try and die, endlessly, until you memorize the location of enemies, weapons and bosses. The fights have been improved compared to the previous chapters, accused of being excessively mechanical and woody. Numerous new animations have been added and the general quality of the executable moves is very good: you can attack from behind, from above, frontally with any weapon, defend yourself and counterattack, or cowardly slaughter your throat by coming out of a corner. However, the variety of actions and attacks is not supported by a particularly elaborate artificial intelligence: a big problem for a stealth game that bases all its fun on interacting with the enemy. Practice is the way to victory, as bushido teaches A Ninja's AI is an important factor Our adversaries do not notice the lack of previously killed ~colleagues~, often they do not notice corpses lying on the ground in front of them, and other times it is enough to simply run away for a few tens of meters to silence dangerous alarms launched a few seconds earlier. Even if we are discovered, then, these do not activate too diligently and quickly, lingering too much in pleasantries and thus giving us all the time to escape elsewhere: running around the maps in search of the final Boss is an excellent technique to finish the level because even if we are discovered by the guards, moving quickly there is almost never the risk of being caught and killed. The multiplayer game is decidedly more exciting, possible through Xbox Live on the internet or in system link, both for up to 4 players. Tackling the missions with three other friends is fun as usual, even if Tenchu Z suffers from such a latency in the connection that it does not allow a vivid identification with the character of the Ninja. If Microsoft will have this aspect patched, surely Tenchu Z's multiplayer would acquire a few more points as the conditions for being excellent are truly all there. Graphics and sound The audiovisual sector of Tenchu Z brings to mind ancient productions for Playstation2. Technically, the title of the Japanese K2 is absolutely nothing exceptional, betraying the ~old-gen~ origin of its graphics engine, adapted for the occasion to develop this new chapter. The polygonal models of the characters are insufficient, starting with those of the protagonists, formed by square blocks with a 90s flavor. The settings are equally sparse, but if nothing else they are saved by the convincing artistic direction that always makes them seem evocative and exotically oriental. Fans of Japanese culture will surely be satisfied. The castles, the houses with their moats, gardens and vegetation are well done, even if the level design does not enjoy much imagination and repeats the same elements more or less throughout the game. Textures are utterly subdued, with no effect applied, as is the lighting which appears to derive from past generation consoles. the level design does not enjoy much imagination and repeats the same elements for the duration of the game Graphics and sound The character design, if we want to make the situation worse, is really bad: at the beginning of Tenchu Z it is possable to create our protagonist, choosing from a set of faces, clothes and options (face shape, complexion, physical features, etc.). It will be really difficult to be able to develop an aesthetically beautiful character to see, most of the faces available seem to be taken directly from those of lifers and criminals. The sound sector is mediocre to absolutely anonymous. It will be difficult to hum a tune heard in Tenchu Z, or pleasantly remember a particular sound heard while we played it. The sounds are well reproduced but do not enjoy an exciting variety that makes you cry out for an audio miracle. Goals 360 Like any game for Xbox 360, Tenchu also offers the player 1000 points. Completing the single player and its 50 levels will earn about 240 points, without considering that each secret mission, if correctly unlocked and performed, gives 20 points each. The remaining points are given by the multiplayer, in which every 50/100/200, up to 1000 kills, a goal is unlocked: decidedly difficult to obtain without often playing online. There are no particular objectives due to specific actions to be performed that can also be unlocked randomly, therefore every single Tenchu Z point must be earned and sweated to the end! Comment Tenchu Z is a title that betrays its ~old-gen~ origin in a clear and evident way. The technical realization of this title is well below the average of today's Xbox 360 productions, showing a polygonal scarcity that is difficult to digest, with subdued textures and details and a decidedly anonymous audio that worsens the general picture. But this wouldn't be the worst of evils, even if the gameplay didn't have consistent problems: the artificial intelligence of the enemies makes even the least shrewd user smile, and the excessive complexity of the controls is an obstacle to the immediacy that a game like it should have. Taking on the role of a Ninja is always fun, but Tenchu's stages fail to involve due to monotonous level design. Too bad also for the multiplayer: very good on paper, but marred by too obvious lag problems. Pros Nippophile fans will appreciate the environments Lots of executable moves and actions Being a Ninja, basically, is fulfilling Cons Old-gen graphics Multiplayer with excessive lag Monotonous single player Artificial intelligence It's been a long time since a game inspired by the mythological Ninjas appeared on an Xbox console; the memory of Ninja Gaiden has almost faded from that now distant 2004, and if we exclude some excellent appearances such as that of Hayabusa in Dead Or Alive 3 and 4, a title inspired by the famous spies of feudal Japan has been missing for too long. Microsoft has therefore decided to publish a new chapter of the famous Tenchu, created by the K2 team, already responsible for the chapters that appeared on Playstation2, PSP and the first Xbox. It's always fun to throw stars, handle nunchuku and practice martial arts: will it be so again this time?", "date": "2007-07-19", "grade": null}
