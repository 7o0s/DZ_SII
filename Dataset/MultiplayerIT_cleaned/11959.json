Future, technology, decadence. Yet the neon is missing, this is immediately striking, and there are lots of trees everywhere. In fact, it runs on largely natural terrains poorly decorated by the organizers with platforms that distribute weapons and luggage and with large arrows placed where the curves of the track border on the geometric impossible. Luckily KOEI has designed a large number of maps, each of which has different tracks running through it. Unfortunately the settings, from tropical to desert-like, end up making them resemble each other dramatically depending on the climatic zone to which they belong. First steps As usual, each vehicle, beyond the aesthetic aspect, is classified on the basis of speed, acceleration, maneuverability and resistance. In career mode we start with the lightest class, in practice rather rapid and fragile midges, some of which are initially unmanageable, and we begin by gaining confidence on short tracks. This mode is obviously essential because it allows you to unlock vehicles and equip them with better engines, better ailerons and in general all those useful mechanical parts to which the adjective best can be added. A few laps of the track are enough and an averagely trained brain realizes that maneuverability is the fundamental characteristic to be able to take advantage of all the possibilities that Fatal Inertia offers us. maneuverability is the key feature to be able to take advantage of all the possibilities that Fatal Inertia offers us First steps The basic formula is in fact called Combat Racing and it is a mix between racing and combat where it is important to get to the end but to do so it is necessary to use a whole series of weapons and trinkets that are acquired by passing over some hot spots represented by a metal disc that emits a bright bluish light. Combat racing and the possibility of customizing the vehicle are best linked with the multiplayer mode which allows 8 players to challenge each other online and attempt to climb the world rankings. The importance of being called maneuverability As anticipated, the correct use of the weapons available, with the exception of the energy overshield, depends on the maneuverability of the vehicle. Simply shooting at an opponent generally produces a lot of useless explosions on the ground even when using guided missiles. In fact, to use most weapons, which involve throwing an object A at a target B, it is advisable to obtain and use a particular device that slows down time. The difficulty of using the weapons is combined with the possibility, or rather the need, of hurling projectiles and mines even from the rear of the vehicle, hoping to slow down or eliminate the pursuers perhaps at the end of a frenetic race. Fortunately, not all weapons and bonuses follow the destructive logic. Fortunately, not all weapons and bonuses follow the destructive logic The importance of being called maneuverability Fatal Inertia's arsenal includes missiles that transform into an impressive boost when fired from behind the vehicle, plus tracking magnets that actually track the target and slow or throw opponents off the road, and finally towers over the already aforementioned device that dilates time by slowing down enemies. Nothing particularly innovative so far and here comes the main dish of Fatal Inertia. In certain races the magnetic cable appears which, apart from the color, comes directly from the A-Wings of Star Wars. The main use foresees the same method of use and even if there are no Imperial Quattropodi to crash into the ground there are however enemy vehicles to pin to the rocks. However KOEI has well thought of exploiting its gimmick properly and has also considered extreme situations such as hooking the end of a cable to an opponent and the other end to another to enjoy the crash or using the cable as a spring to project forward or to be towed by a faster competitor and then mow him down and pass him on the finish. Out of control Controlling vehicles is challenging even once you increase the degree of maneuverability considerably. Therefore, in order to have the opportunity to turn in good time, in addition to choosing the times, it is necessary to take possessionof two means. One is the aileron that is activated with the triggers and facilitates the turn in the desired direction and the other consists of a sort of instantaneous brake that stops the vehicle leaving the engine at full power, in this way it allows us to turn in mid-air for a few moments and to start again once released, guaranteeing a minimum loss of speed. Despite the amount of bonuses, controls and customizations of the vehicles, it can still be difficult to manage the Fatal Inertia racing cars that really don't want to listen to the pilot and the few destructible objects on the map complicate the matter because these racing cars tend to literally bounce against us, throwing us spin that makes little sense physically and playfully. At this point the reset button intervenes which takes us back to the center of the track instantly. A reset button that does not involve any kind of malus? Well yes, and the reason is not long in coming. Unfortunately, as with curves, collisions and weapons, this feature also tends to play tricks and does not hesitate to place us in front of a pillar, a leap into the void or an area where it is inevitable to get stuck with the need to press again the reset button. Obviously modest In general, the lines of the vehicles are pleasant, although some models closely resemble some varieties of upside-down bathtubs. The polygons are not wasted, the destructible objects are absent and the tracks are rather sparse. The water is pleasant to look at but terribly still in its ripples. In short, it can be said that Fatal Inertia makes a rather relaxed use of the Unreal Engine. There would be nothing scandalous for an ostentatiously modest title, if everything weren't accompanied by evident slowdowns and the delayed appearance of large portions of the map, even if both factors are less heavy than what happened in the terrible demo published on the market place. The audio profile doesn't bite but it doesn't bark either. Except for the speed boost the sound effects are rather dull and not very attention grabbing. The soundtrack recalls, from afar, early techno music and features a couple of catchy but decidedly inadequate pieces, not very powerful and decidedly obsessive in the long run. Comment The lack of new generation futuristic racing and the introduction of the magnetic cable are two elements that can make you consider the purchase of Fatal Inertia. Yet we do not feel like openly recommending this possibility to any category of gamer. KOEI has wasted some potentially interesting ideas by paying little attention to both the driving feeling, both in the design of the maps, and in the enjoyment of its product which is undermined by negligence capable of alienating even the most calm gamer. Pros good idea of magnetic cable articulated gameplay..... Cons ...but roughly applied superficially developed technically insufficient Fatal Inertia is available for Xbox 360 and will also be released for PlayStation 3. The tested version is the one for Xbox 360. Goals 360 Completing the Fatal Inertia objectives is a matter of time. To be able to manage most of the objectives, ranging from the destruction of 1 or more opponents up to 1000 combat points, it is necessary to have a well-bodied vehicle, progress from series to series in the career and run several hundred races. In addition, a healthy dose of additional patience is needed since there are the canonical objectives which provide for a total (20) of games won for each game mode and a series of victories in multiplayer. Futuristic racing, big corporations, endless chrome and neon shells. Considering it as a whole, futuristic racing cannot be defined as a lucky trend, condemned by the apparent simplicity of development to being savagely approached by those who think that producing a ~game~ is enough to enter the world of video games. And yet, despite being a genre that can often be evaluated per kilo, it is the very symbol of the video game, of the playful dynamism and of the non-simulation video game and these factors, combined with a capable team, are able to give life to manifestations of pure playability such as the Wipeout and F-Zero milestones or the occasional gem like Pod.", "date": "2007-10-05", "grade": null}
