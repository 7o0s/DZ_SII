Because if he gets angry, it's pain. Then maybe he also tries to stay calm, on his comfortable Olympic throne, but there's always something that forces him to pick up arms and baggage and start a new adventure. Whether this happens on a home console or on a laptop, it doesn't matter. After the certainly not unforgettable reduction for mobile phones that appeared in 2007, the passage of the God of War on the handheld is linked for obvious reasons to PSP, with the previous Chains of Olympus made by the Californians Ready at Dawn; given the excellent results collected on that occasion, the team was totally reconfirmed also for this second release on the laptop, entitled God of War: The Ghost of Sparta. This is Sparta Reviews usually start by introducing the game, talking about the plot and characters, or the gameplay. In this case we will make an exception, fully justified however; because God of War: The Ghost of Sparta really cannot be described without first speaking of the aesthetic component, capable of establishing itself without a doubt as the highest point at a technical level reached on the Sony laptop. A console, we recall, destined to soon complete its sixth year of life; and, we say it without fear of offending anyone, with the best moments of its life cycle now behind it. But there have been several so-called ~swan songs~ for hardware on sunset avenue, and this label also fits perfectly in the case of this latest Kratos adventure. Never before on PSP, and more generally therefore on a laptop, had such graphic quality been seen; God of War: The Ghost of Sparta is from this point of view a sensational production, capable of even surpassing the results collected by the second chapter on PS2. The goodness of the polygonal modeling, both of the characters and of the settings, is something that leaves no room for the slightest criticism; and the work of the camera is also exceptional, always used with such skill as to emphasize the most pathos-laden moments without ever forgetting to correctly support the gameplay. The only note that can be moved is linked to the frame rate, not always perfect especially in particularly charged situations, even if levels are never reached that would excessively compromise the fluidity of the action. Surely the most important result of the programmers' work, however, is to be found in the fact that God of War: The Ghost of Sparta never appears as a reduced or adapted version of the major chapters that appeared on the home console; not only for the sheer brute force of Ready at Dawn's polygonal engine, but also for the evocative power of this umpteenth Kratos adventure. In fact, one of the characteristic aspects of the series has always been that of ~dimensions~, with a scale of measures always against the protagonist, destined to travel alone in imposing and disturbing places, facing enemies several times bigger than him. Mythical feats, with goals out of reach for anyone but the Ghost of Sparta; because the exaltation and involvement offered by God of War are the cornerstones of its success, with a characterization and a personality that has few equals in the entire videogame panorama. Brotherly Love This time the plot, which takes place on a temporal level between the first and second chapters, is centered around Kratos' search for his brother Deimos, kidnapped by the gods when both were little more than children but nevertheless already full of the warrior spirit spartan. A more than sufficient story, narrated without hesitation, but which changes almost nothing in the hero's known background so far. As per tradition, during the journey of the protagonist we find ourselves meeting a whole series of places and characters from Greek mythology, wonderful protagonists as much as Kratos himself. The initial sequence in Atlantis, for example, is something exceptional, with a rhythm that really seems to be one of the leitmotifs of the entire series. The clash with the gigantic Scylla then, destined to continue and repeat itself at various times, represents something that we never expected to see on a laptop, and which deserves to be seen in first person. We are a little sorry that other enemies of similar size are missing in the course of the adventure, except for the incredible final battle and little else; this certainly does not detract from the value of the product, but there is no doubt that within the entire series the most exalted and epic moments coincided with fights of this type. As far as the level design is concerned,the work done by the American team is more than good; as always the progression is linear and guided, but there is a particular dynamism in the situations offered and the pace is always high, perhaps with the exception of the last hour and a half of the game which is based a little too much on the succession of full rooms of enemies to be killed in order to continue. In any case, God of War: The Ghost of Sparta is certainly not an episode that intends to detach itself from the previous ones or to innovate the formula studied by Santa Monica Studio; in this sense, those who have perceived a bit of tiredness in the mechanics of the series born in 2005 will undoubtedly feel the same sensations in this case too. The game structure is practically identical, both in the combat system and in the growth of the character. The title was and remains a practically pure action, and the few and very simple puzzles present never go beyond the need to collect keys or activate levers and switches. In this sense, indeed, one perceives a step backwards compared to the third episode. The only real novelty is to be found in the ability, once earned by the titan Tera, to ignite one's trusted Blades of Athena; a necessity to overcome certain passages or to overcome the armor worn by certain enemies. Although it should be absolutely emphasized that everything slips away perfectly even at the gates of 2011, it is clear that longtime fans of the series will be able to experience several times the sensations of deja-vu that are anything but subtle. Absolutely wonderful, as always, the musical accompaniment; in addition to the excellent dubbing in Italian, the evocative orchestrated pieces, fundamental and essential in the overall picture of the series, also find space in this episode. Finally, as regards the overall longevity, despite the claims of some reviews who enthusiastically indicated the duration of the adventure around 10 hours, on the contrary less than 7 hours are enough for any average expert player of the series to reach the final credits ( 6 and a half hours in our case); a result that is more than satisfactory and practically almost double compared to the aforementioned Chains of Olympus, to which a whole series of extra challenges must be added for those who want to stay longer in the role of the Ghost of Sparta.", "date": "2010-11-02", "grade": "9.2"}
