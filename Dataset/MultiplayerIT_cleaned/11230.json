But it's still about the Sims and in fact the classic elements of the series are all present in this new version for DS. The first thing we have to do, once the game has started, is to give a personalized look to our Simmer by deciding between a range of clothes and appearances which, to tell the truth, appear rather limited to us. Considering the fact that it is not our aspect that is the focal point within the game, we would say that we can in any case be satisfied. Once this is done we will find ourselves inside our apartment, which can also be customized according to the canons to which the series has accustomed us. We have at our disposal a basic furniture, but we can change it by buying new pieces of furniture among those available and simply replacing the existing ones. We will deal with dogs and cats, but also with snakes, parrots and hamsters After all, they are always Sims There are also all the usual statistics of our character, the bars of hunger, bathroom, sleep and sociality. Pretty simple to keep under control, among other things. Downstairs we find the beauty salon for pets, where we will do our work, which can also be furnished in the same way as the apartment. This with regard to the classic mechanics of the series, within which the real focal point of the game is inserted, namely the animals. We will deal with dogs and cats, of course, but also with snakes, parrots and hamsters, with which we will be able to undertake a series of mini-games which serve as a side dish and a digression from the routine of the game. Brushes, perfumes and collars But we were talking about glamor and beauty salons, and what is actually our main occupation in the game: making our animals worthy of any catwalk. The game, in this sector, is divided into two different situations: on the one hand we have the animals that we will keep as guests in our apartment, entrusted to us by relatives or various customers and on the other the actual beauty salon, where the customers will take us their four-legged companions. In both cases, pet grooming takes place through a menu that allows you to brush, wash, perfume, change collars and, essentially, carry out all the cleaning and aesthetic activities that can revolve around a dog or a cat. In the case of entrusted animals, we will not earn money to carry out these tasks, however, which will be necessary to maintain their level of affection and well-being. Money will be earned, on the other hand, every time the scrolling message appears on our screen that warns us of the entry of a new customer into the shop below the apartment. If we go down to take care of them and we succeed in solving the problems that have made our services necessary, we will earn what we need to be able to buy games, furniture, clothes, food and everything necessary to move forward in the game, keeping ourselves and the animals at entrusted to us. Grooming takes place in a rather simple way: a few touches of the stylus will be enough to diagnose the problems of the animals, usually matted fur, bad smell, dirt and the desire to change the collar. From the toilet menu we can then solve them by washing them, perfuming them, brushing them and, in short, doing whatever is necessary. These sorts of mini-games are played simply with short strokes of the stylus or pressure of the backbones, following the instructions on the screen. Treasure hunts and snake charmers Snakes, hamsters, parrots and all sorts of other caged animals can populate our apartment. We cannot groom them, on the other hand we can buy them some clothing (the snake with the cap is a sight that generates discomfort) and, above all, play a series of mini-games which, in addition to breaking the extreme repetitiveness of grooming, will allow us to earn some simoleons in more, assuming we carry them out successfully. Which is not always very easy, thanks to a great imprecision of the controls, which often generate failure and frustration. For example, with the snake we will be able to play a sort of game of charmers, playing a series of notes that will appear on a similar score and thus enchanting the animal. The notes will be represented by the four keys of the console and by their respective letters and will be pressed in time and in succession while we blow into the microphone, thus imitating the flute of the fakirs. All this, as nice as it may seem, is really not very usable and we gave upafter a few frustrated attempts. The parrot that can be made to dance by tapping the colored arrows that scroll on the screen in time is much more affordable and a great way to increase our Simoleons. With dogs and cats, on the other hand, we can engage in ~treasure hunting~, which basically makes us guide the animals in a courtyard to then have them dig in search of simoleons hidden on the ground when their nose indicates their presence. Leaving aside the perplexities about ~sniff cats~, we found it quite boring and unprofitable and consequently to abandon it too after a few performances. Comment The Sims 2: Live With Friends & Pets is essentially yet another spin off of the famous simulation series, inserted on the Nintendo laptop. We are dealing with pets of all kinds, certainly appealing to a younger audience, as the market is constantly demonstrating by now. However, the dynamics of the game are extremely repetitive and boring, to the point of making even the most ardent fan of the series lose interest in the game. Its extremely simplified mechanics and the impossibility of making mistakes make the game suitable for very young ages, falling within the games intended for a childish audience, while for older children it is difficult to find a reason to play it. Graphics and sound are well cared for and the variety of accessories for furniture and clothing is acceptable, while the accuracy of the camera and controls leave much to be desired. Recommended for children who want to have fun tying customers' kittens with bows. Pros Pleasant graphics and sound, typical of the series Fair variety of animals and mini-games Impossibility of error, suitable for children Cons Inaccurate and sometimes frustrating controls Repetitiveness such as to make the game tedious in a short time Mini-games in some cases useless and frustrating", "date": "2008-09-01", "grade": null}
