Ingenuously, in fact. At the end of the 80s, Ghosts 'n Goblins represented a disturbing experience for the writer: in the eyes of a little boy, those zombies that protruded from the ground and menacingly approached the heroic protagonist created a sense of tension and of anguish perfectly assisted by the soundtrack of the Capcom title, which in truth more than the cinematic undead referred to a classic gothic imagery, almost from a silent film. Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, a screenshot from the intro sequence. Taking Nintendo Switch in hand and putting on Sir Arthur's heavy armor again in this latest interpretation of the franchise, created in collaboration with its creator Tokuro Fujiwara, was therefore a bit like facing one's demons of the past, aware that often and gladly beating them is impossible. Well, if there is one aspect that Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection clarifies right from the start, it is this: it is difficult to separate the experience from its illustrious past and talk about it as if it were an independent project. It isn't, of course. We are faced with a tribute that lends itself to different interpretations, to different evaluations, but which certainly hits the mark where it is simply a matter of putting ourselves to the test. Gameplay Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, a bunch of the first level. In short, difficulty is the central aspect of this remake, which draws both from Ghosts 'n Goblins and from its sequel, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, to deliver us a campaign that is as varied and consistent as possible, but which in terms of longevity focuses on our personal ability to progress more than on the content itself. The gameplay of Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, which takes up the classic command scheme with jump and attack, in short rejects smoothing and modernizations, confirming itself as strongly oriented towards trial & error: you enter an area, get as far as possible, you die and you start again, trying to reach the checkpoints so you don't have to start from the beginning. Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, one of the boss fights in the game. It goes without saying that the bosses constitute a further obstacle to our ambitions for glory, they appear as generally enormous creatures and are equipped with a very precise attack and movement pattern, which must be memorized in order to be able to survive and find the right opening to strike. In an attempt to save his beloved, the path that Sir Arthur will have to face in the game is made up of five areas which however present crossroads and alternative scenarios, some of which are accessible immediately, full of enemies but also of weapons and objects that we can collect in order to unlock a new skill set. Special powers Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, one of the many sections where you have to avoid traps. Visitable from the main map, the tree of powers feeds on the fireflies that we have caught along the way to allow us to obtain extra abilities such as flames that protect the character, lightning that strikes from his sides, spells that transform common enemies into frogs or Arthur in a rolling rock, which create a double of him and so on. it deals mostly with powers that do not provide substantial advantages compared to the great limitation of the protagonist of the game, namely his ability to move. Difficulty Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, a ~glacial~ level with many pitfalls. In fact, it is Arthur's slowness and his inability to modulate the jumps that determine the degree of challenge of the experience, which becomes rough and ruthless in its platform facets more than in the fights, marked in a classic way but with the addition of vertical attacks and some new tools, not always brilliant and often inferior to the ordinance spear. in which errors are forgiven only to the extent that the difficulty level selected from the four available allows it, which increase or decrease the number of opponents and Arthur's resistance to attacks.Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, one of the giants that we will have to face during the campaign. An exception is the Page mode, in which in practice it is not possible to die: the character is reborn exactly where he was defeated, and although this setting does not affect the hardness of the platform phases, especially those with retractable platforms, it is inevitably a trivial way to get to the end of the campaign. The cooperative mode Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, the cooperative mode in action. Among the novelties of Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, the local cooperative mode undoubtedly stands out, which introduces a whole new way of approaching the experience. In fact, the second player controls a floating spirit that can take on three different forms, does not fear death (in case of excessive damage it returns to activity after a few seconds) and assists Arthur in his adventure. How, exactly? Attacking enemies, creating defensive energy barriers for his partner or platforms to climb on when needed, or even grabbing him to lift him into the air. Coordinating isn't easy, but when you succeed, the cooperative takes on really interesting connotations. Graphics and sound Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection, the flying knights with the shield are annoying even in this reinterpretation. If it is true that the soundtrack of Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection will somewhat agree with everyone, made up as it is of orchestral remakes of the original music, the graphics of the game can instead become a dividing element, and in fact it has already created different alignments among the fans of the series: some appreciate the new graphic style, others hate it. As far as we are concerned, the aesthetic choice made by the development team is understandable, who wanted to stay away from three-dimensional interpretations and tried to give the experience a connotation similar to that of medieval illustrations, animating the characters as if they were puppets with joints. The final result is pleasant, thanks also to the fluidity guaranteed by the 60 fps: during the campaign we recorded only a few uncertainties of the graphics engine, the powerful and versatile RE Engine, the same as Resident Evil Village, here used by Capcom in a decidedly different way than usual.", "date": "2021-02-23", "grade": "7.5"}
