The items available are few, the screens denote excessive simplicity, not to say carelessness, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The problems are quite different and concern the omission of details and methods present in the 128-bit versions, such as the Pes Shop (virtual shop dedicated to unlocking bonuses), the training challenge and a player editor drastically regressed from the previous chapter. The random match mode much appreciated in Winning Eleven 10 is also missing, not to mention the presence of only 8 stadiums, when the PS2 version hosts quadruple. The legendary game producer Shingo Seabass Takatsuka had already blamed these cuts on the scarcity of available time, but seeing the extent is particularly annoying for those who faithfully follow the saga. Other omissions, to be honest common to all versions of this year, concern the absence of the Bundesliga and various licenses, including most of the national teams and almost all of the English Premiership (present only Manchester and Arsenal), inexplicable then the lack of that of Chelsea, when it was present in the previous chapter. In this sense, the limitations of the editor begin to weigh heavily, it being impossible to implement any modification to the jerseys and appearance of the players. Welcome to next generation soccer The spirit that brings the player to the match isn't the best, but fortunately ball and chain it's impossible not to notice the extreme playful goodness of this production. The first thing that catches the eye is the overhaul of the game engine, which is mainly responsible for the cuts mentioned above. Although it does not dissect the potential of the hardware it runs on, Pes 6 distances itself from the 128 bit editions, when evaluated on a hd display, the 16:9 format allows a more satisfying view of the playing field, the audience is now entirely polygonal (albeit very rough) and players enjoy a complete remodel. The stadiums are more detailed, while the textures of the grass have a pleasant 3d effect during close-up shots. On the other hand, the lack of a lighting system is still evident, compensated by a very slight implementation of HDR in some sections of the field. The rendering of the skin is also extremely elementary, which contributes to making a very unrealistic appearance. All in all, the general aspect is appreciable and functional, considering that it has never been one of the strengths of the saga. But it was perhaps reasonable to expect a little more, especially in light of the levels obtained by EA Sports with the next-gen version of Fifa 07. Evolutions A very different matter concerns the gameplay, which benefits from a substantial revision. Totally abandoning the frenzy and excesses of Winning Eleven 10, Pes 6 marries a philosophy of uncompromising simulation rigor. Not to levels that distort its essence, but enough to ascertain its irrefutable evolution. First of all, the rhythms are considerably slowed down, as is the strength of the passages, deliberately dampened to emphasize the physicality that distinguishes this edition as much as possible. Pes 6 is an architecture open to various interpretations, where everyone can find their own play space, and refine it without ever reaching the limit. Evolutions The ball is fought like never before, the CPU performs an asphyxiating pressure, with an extremely efficient defense in covering positions. The result is an extremely tense climate, which requires painstaking care and precision in the orchestration of the passages. The beginning can therefore be traumatic for those who are not accustomed to simulation, but what makes the difference is precisely the sophisticated control system combined with the efficiency of the ball. Pes 6 is an architecture open to various interpretations, where everyone can find their own play space, and refine it without ever reaching the limit. It is not a novelty in an absolute sense, Konami has accustomed us to all this, but the desire to improve is evident, starting from the lesser automation of passes and shots. In essence we are faced with a highly technical gameplay, perhaps even too much, which could contradict those who search the net after a few minutes of play. But those who love football cannot fail to be thrilled by the complexity achieved by Kcet, by the fact that every match, every action, every shot on goal will have its own peculiar story. Needless to underline the potential of games with friends on duty. As usual, the audio sector is much more modest, with the commentary by Civoli and Sandreani, pertinent to the action, but very uninspiring in terms of tone and content. On the other hand, the performance of the audience has significantly improved, as it shouts and applauds with a decidedly gratifying vehemence. The shouts of the coaches on the sidelines are also very welcome. This match no longer exists The game supports the Live service, but this section also suffers from substantial limitations, with the only choice of player or ranked matches, exclusively one against one. Everything is presented with an excessive essentiality, without any concrete step forward from the previous chapter on Xbox. Currently there are also significant connection problems, being particularly difficult to play games outside the friends list, we also encountered some lag problems. All this would also be tolerable if not compared to the service provided on PC and PS2, fully compatible between the two formats, equipped with dedicated lobbies and the possibility of games for up to four players. In comparison, the 360 version is unfairly cut in terms of features and online, and this last point is truly paradoxical considering the identity of the Microsoft console. The enormous playability of the production suggests leniency, but next year Konami will have to seriously work to fill these gaps. Target hunters Following the trend of the latest titles released, the goal system of Pes 6 is quite demanding. Earning the coveted 1000 points basically requires completing all competitions, from cups to leagues. Most of the objectives concern the offline part, but there are some dedicated to fans of the big network, as evidenced by the 20 points awarded after playing the first ranked match (regardless of the outcome). Good luck! Comment PES 6 is a strong source of pride for Xbox users, as for the first time in many years a non-Sony system hosts the next-gen debut of the Takatsuka saga. However, what could have been a great celebration is partially obscured by an irrefutably hasty realization, which led to a series of cuts too substantial not to be highlighted. The technical implementation is pleasant and distinctive compared to the 128-bit versions, but it certainly doesn't make you cry for a miracle by making minimal use of the 360 hardware. The Live support is also disappointing, really too limited, plagued by lag and considerable difficulty in finding games, a defect the latter which we hope will be resolved as soon as possible. What remains, however, is no small thing, and it is what most interests enthusiasts from all over the world. The best football in circulation, another step towards the perfect simulation, a product destined to last a long time. Next year, however, in addition to the substance, we also hope for a little side dish... Pros Stratospheric playability Slight, but noticeable graphic improvements compared to the 128-bit versions Finally the public makes itself heard Cons Too many cuts Very incomplete online mode Too many licenses still missing Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is available for PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the Xbox 360 version. For the review of the PC and PlayStation 2 versions, follow this link. Pro Evolution Soccer represents the flagship of Konami sports productions, being the only saga that has managed to survive over the years and establish itself as an absolute reference point for football simulations. Known in Japan and America as Winning Eleven, it has carved out an increasingly important place for itself in the European market, with sensational collections at each edition. This year the novelty for the owners of the new Microsoft console is really big, not to mention epochal, namely the 2006 exclusive for the nextgen version, i.e. until next autumn when PlayStation 3 will be available. We too could hardly believe it, considering the close relationship with Sony platforms, but after so many coverages, the wait is over and the game is finally here, in our hands. Is it time to celebrate? Yes, but with some reservations.", "date": "2006-11-01", "grade": null}
