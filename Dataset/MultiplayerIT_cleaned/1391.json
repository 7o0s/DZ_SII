The first impact with the game is positive, even if it shows some shortcomings on more than one occasion: the Rogue Ops graphics engine performs quite well, recreating complex levels, fairly detailed and explorable in every corner thanks to passages, tunnels, pipelines . The 3D model of the protagonist also moves well and is full of animations, especially when the very choreographed combos are activated. However, the same cannot be said of the other characters present, often very poor in terms of polygons and with little credible movements. Even from the sound side, the work is valuable: music that is never too intrusive and a well-finished dubbing are the right outline for Rogue Ops, although the sound effects in some cases have very little realistic. The possibility of creating a real path to get to the end of each level is certainly very interesting, left to the player's discretion: to evade the surveillance systems, electronic cards are often enough, which can be obtained by eliminating some guards, but if you are unable to recover there are many other ways to achieve the same goal, sharpening a minimum of wit and interacting with the surrounding environment. Like any self-respecting secret agent, Miss Conners will be able to count on many weapons (don't underestimate the shurikens, they will often prove indispensable) and a large amount of gadgets, from the infrared viewer to the flying micro camera, to get to the Adrenaline Boost, in capable of temporarily altering our protagonist's perceptions by slowing down everything that happens around her. While on the one hand the various weapons and gadgets available to Nikki allow a very detailed exploration, the most interesting part of the action component remains the combos with which to neutralize the guards without being seen. In fact, by approaching a soldier stealthily, a bar will be filled up: the more you remain hidden behind him (but also increasing the risk of being discovered) and the simpler the combination of moves to perform afterwards will be. By pressing the action button, a sequence of directions will then appear, to be performed in the correct order with the analog stick, to see Nikki perform a very violent series of holds that will kill the victim without alerting the other supervisors. Absolutely lethal. I want a woman in a skirt What really risks perplexing is the artificial intelligence of the enemies, strangely fluctuating and not very precise: if sometimes even doing everything to be noticed the guards do not move an inch, in other cases even if well hidden in the shadows it is very easy to be discovered. In levels where secrecy is not important this does not constitute a particular problem, but in other missions where the stealth component is fundamental such an error of evaluation risks nullifying what has been accomplished up to that moment, and without an apparent explanation. Even the control system, although very valid and intuitive when it comes to exploring, looking for objects or other things to interact with, shows some obvious limits in terms of ease of use in the most critical situations. As the first level teaches us, in the form of a tutorial, by moving the camera Nikki will automatically recognize a ledge to cling to, a crate to move or a container to examine, just being at the right distance. But the too many buttons for managing the actions risk being confused, the change of weapon and view becomes cumbersome and with an armed enemy in front of you it is not easy to react quickly. Not to mention some inexplicable, rather annoying behaviors. For example, try running towards a staircase and you will understand: even by pressing the action button, you will first have to stop, wait for Nikki to climb the first step and then raise the analog controller again to go up. The same goes for the change of weapon: it is not enough to scroll through the list of those available for it to be replaced automatically, you must first put the one in use and then extract the new one. Nothing terribly serious, but more often than not a similar movement management penalizes the immediacy of the game. Comment Rogue Ops is certainly a very good action game, halfway between stealth and pure action, and which guarantees the player great freedom of action and decision. With a respectable technical sector and a well-calibrated level of difficulty (even if at the most difficult level the choice to play it as a stealth is practically obligatory) it is an interestante alternative to games like Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, especially for those who occasionally prefer a little healthy rain of bullets to stealth action. Too bad, however, for the control system, and in general for Nikki's management of all possible actions, which too often lead to the use of the wrong object or to reacting in a non-timely manner to what happens on the screen, especially when is under fire or in other critical situations. Pros: Wide freedom of action Spectacular combos Different paths to complete the levels An agent in a skirt is always a good show Cons: Fluctuating enemy AI Control system too complex and unintuitive It doesn't happen very often to see a woman as the protagonist of a video game, but when it happens it's certainly a pleasant surprise, especially on an aesthetic level. But wearing a skintight black suit is not enough to attract the player's attention, and the programmers of Bits Studios seem to have worked hard. Maybe it's time to shed some light on Nikki Conners' past, and why she became a real James Bond in a skirt: after a life spent serving the army, our charming protagonist was finally willing to let herself go shoulders his past, to devote himself to the family. But all this could not go unnoticed in the eyes of the criminal organization Omega 13, which comes to kill her husband and young daughter: with no more emotional ties, and eager for revenge against these criminals, here she is in the role of a spy to eliminate root who took away the dream of a normal life. They will be high-risk missions, but by now Nikki has nothing to lose, and so here she is engaged in solitary actions of espionage and sabotage; it is then up to the player to find out how the adventure will evolve, thanks also to the cutscenes.", "date": "2004-02-16", "grade": null}
