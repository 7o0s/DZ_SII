The game consists in pressing the button that appears on the screen (directional keys only) when it is displayed inside a circle (which represents the analog stick) located at the bottom left. There aren't many game modes that can be unlocked by finishing the rhythmic adventure, but it is worth mentioning the two-player one in which we will be able to face a friend of ours in an attempt to collect the most points before time runs out. Also nice is the possibility of taking over the reins of directing the game and recording by positioning the cameras where we like best but nothing else that considerably increases the longevity of the game. The control system is simple while the difficulty can be calibrated from the options menu. Personally I have finished the game twice in a row in less than two hours at the INSANE level, the most difficult we can find, getting the maximum points. I'm good? I'm afraid not, since even if you press the button a few seconds late, the game still accepts it as valid... Just a few polygons, the bare essentials, and the resolution you can forget... The graphics of the game are certainly impactful during the Full Motion Video interlude between one song and another. The animations seem to come out of a Toy Story-style movie and are really very accurate. Unfortunately The Jungle Book Groove Party loses a bit of shots in the game in real time so that some characters seem copied from an abstract painting, but always remaining quite detailed and average. The sound is certainly the strong point of the game with songs that sometimes don't even make logical sense but which are most of the time hilarious. The speech is completely in Italian even if some texts have remained in English. To the unfortunate reviewer and the heartless parent... In summary, this is certainly a product for at least a young target. However, seeing it in the hands of a child can leave you perplexed, as the game is extremely difficult for the little ones and on the contrary extremely easy for the older ones. In short, we are dealing with a very nice title only to see and hear, but not to play... provided that pressing 4 buttons repeatedly can make it a game. Do you feel like dancing? Go to the disco! Pros: Colorful graphics, above average sound Cons: PS2 doesn't look good An hour of dance in the jungle! What does Walt Disney offer us today? Simple, a nice rhythm-game for PlayStation 2, with good graphics, really nice music, and with that dose of repetitiveness and little longevity that everyone hates so much. Perhaps pressing the keys on the joypad for more than an hour in a row would not have been enough... and so the duration of this game is even less than that of the film it is inspired by! It all starts in the jungle and where else?", "date": "2001-06-23", "grade": null}
