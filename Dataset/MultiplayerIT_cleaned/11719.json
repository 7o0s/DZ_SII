{"name": "Ratatouille: Cheese Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ratatouille-cheese-rush.html", "text": "~Making a virtue out of necessity~ is the motto of all those developers who have come up against a series of limitations (which can be technical, but also practical...) and have managed to translate them into an advantage. In the case of Ratatouille, given the results achieved by some recent products, it is probable that a platform of a certain quality could be put together, but a different direction was opted for: producing a decidedly atypical racing game, with a inertial, which puts us in the role of the film's protagonist mouse in his search for the ingredients to bring to his human friend for cooking. All through three different Parisian settings... The start screen of Ratatouille: Cheese Rush allows us to choose whether to try our hand at the ~Career~, with a ~Fast run~, with the ~Arcade~ mode or with ~Time Attack~ (or the classic ~Time Attack~. ..). The ~Career~ sees us tackle the three locations in sequence (~Mabel Farm~, ~Sewers of Paris~ and ~Gusteau Restaurant~), each consisting of five stages, while in the other modes you can choose a level from those unlocked to replay it . The development of the game is very simple: our mouse moves automatically and we have to direct its movement by pressing the joystick left and right (or by acting on the 4 and 6 keys of the numeric pad), eventually braking its momentum by pressing the joystick down ( or with key 8). The goal is to follow the smell of cheese, graphically represented by small yellow clouds (which get bigger as you get closer to the goal), until you find it and complete the stage. Before the complete form, we will also be able to find small slices of cheese, each of which will give us the possibility of using a temporary invulnerability against the numerous obstacles found in the level. The bar at the top of the screen fills up by collecting the smell of cheese and acts a bit as energy for our character: when you reset the game you lose it, and it drops a little every time you come across an element of disturbance. Before starting to play, you can select the level of difficulty from the three available, which in fact affect the speed of movement of the mouse and which therefore make it more or less easy for us to maneuver it. As far as the technical realization is concerned, this particular Ratatouille tie-in looks really good. There are only three different settings, it's true, but they are characterized by a good level of detail and well-chosen colors, as well as a very convincing scrolling and a fluid animation of the mouse, obtained mostly from the rotation of the sprite. Unfortunately, in the more advanced stages there are slowdowns in the action, which however do not disturb the progress of the ~race~. The sound sector is made up of some fairly well-made tunes, which have the great advantage of not annoying and are equipped with volume adjustment via software. Finally, the control system has only three keys and is therefore absolutely simple and immediate: you immediately understand how the game works and the only thing you need to get familiar with is the ~slippery~ behavior of the mouse, the whose inertia in the movements is still part of the basic idea of Cheese Rush.
