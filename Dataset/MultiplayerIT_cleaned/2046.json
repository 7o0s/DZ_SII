{"name": "Gran Turismo Concept Tokyo-Geneva", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gran-turismo-concept-tokyo-geneva.html", "text": "But did the guys from Poliphony play with Mariokart? Graphically the game is if possible better than ~its father~: the polygonal models seem more defined as well as the general quality of the backgrounds, especially as regards the textures of the roads. If my memory serves me correctly, the number of objects on the sides of the circuits seems to have increased: grandstands and various buildings appear where emptiness previously reigned. Graphically it is therefore on levels of excellence that is unrivaled by any other automotive title on the market, there is no Gotham racing or Wreckless that hold: the threshold of photorealism has been reached and widely exceeded. The same goes for the audio part: the engine samples, as usual, reach the state of the art. Not everything, as I previously said in the incipit, goes smoothly: taken by itself, as a title in its own right, Gt certainly doesn't make a good impression. It's too short, you can finish it, albeit with minimal effort, that is, earning only bronze cups in licenses within a few hours. However, if you want to get more professional times, aiming for gold to unlock all the unlockables, then the game gets really tough. You are gripped by the pole position syndrome: the times to beat are so low that you will spend hours trying to brush through curves and curbs without even realizing it. This is its greatest value and at the same time its greatest limitation: the toughest challenge is played against oneself in full onanistic-racing ecstasy. This mode highlights the even more evident disparity between cars with automatic gearboxes and those with manual ones: in some situations where the revs drop fearfully, the car downshifts late, compromising the efforts made up to that point, thousandth after thousandth; in other words, certain cars need a manual gearbox, and if you have only played with the automatic one, the changeover, despite its simplicity, is in any case quite traumatic. The most beautiful thing or, depending on your point of view, the ugly thing is the physics of the driving model. It would have been better if they had inserted Arcade as the subtitle. Mind you it's not an absolute bad thing, the feeling of the game remains intact, only that now the cars are much more forgiving, and putting two wheels on the curb and braking can be a great choice. The top is reached in the single race challenges with the fastest cars: here all the less simulative characteristics of the ~real driving simulator~ are enhanced, such as wild shots, curve cuts and dropper braking, also considering the few laps available (3 /5). In other words, the single race is limitless fun which, depending on the car you choose, oscillates between arcade/simulation and Mariokart. The rally mode is instead a clear step forward compared to the previous one; now the cars behave decidedly more sensible, they slip much less, the right/left pendulum behavior that is the real stone of the Gt3 simulation scandal is avoided. It is a pity that once the not many routes have been exhausted, the challenge clearly diminishes, also because the artificial intelligence of the runners is certainly not very developed. Retroactive title? The main problem of this title rather than the lack of longevity (since in theory the single race races can be replayed with each car), is its excessive arcade component, which clearly can make the purists of the series turn up their noses. Ultimately Gt concept is a rather strange title, which takes up the formula of its predecessor, however completely overturning it: in short, we are dealing with a sort of synopsis of Gt3, rewritten however only having in mind some parts of the title. However, the choice cannot fail to be spot on, given the underlying complexity of the product. For this reason, sections for buying and selling parts and tuning worthy of The Fast and the Furious are missing. Summing up, Gt concept is certainly a good title, fun, graphically more beautiful than Gt3, but short and short-lived. If you have a copy of Gt3 you appreciate it even more (even for reasons that it is better not to reveal), as a game in its own right globally it is a little bit, as an add on it is the non plus ultra of fun. pros very fun even better graphics photorealistic models cons short too few arcade circuits The hardest review in the world GT concept is a difficult product to review for several reasons: it is not a long and long-lived title, you pay less for it but you still pay for it, it is totally arcade, therefore it distorts the ~simulation~ vision of Gran Turismo as we know it, but has from its great graphics, great bonuses and a lot of fun. In thissummer edition of GT Poliphony corrects part of the shortcomings that afflicted GT3: more European cars, a less ~slippery~ rally mode, and faster and easier to obtain satisfaction from vehicle accumulation. The heart of the game lies in obtaining licenses: each license obtained unlocks the respective circuit, and a car depending on the performance achieved. Once the circuit has been unlocked, it can be tackled in single, normal and difficult race modes; winning both difficulty levels will win two cars. There is no money, no used cars to buy, no upgrades to do, no real garage. We already start with a large number of cars available, those that are won will be added to these little by little, for a total of about 100, including European, Asian, concept and supercar cars. The game is all here, you get licenses, win races, accumulate cars and wait for the final bonus, in many ways a real godsend. Adding more, we can say that the previous version includes the circuits of Tokyo, Tahiti and Midfield and Swiss Alps, new entry the old acquaintance of the Autumn Ring, clearly all viable straight and reverse.", "date": "2002-07-25", "grade": null}
