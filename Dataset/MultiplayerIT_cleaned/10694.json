We are obviously talking about the theatrical release of Terminator Salvation which is presented as the first episode of a new trilogy of the killing machines saga created by James Cameron and this highly anticipated event could only be accompanied, as usual, by a new tie- in a videogame that exploits the name and narration of the film. Players often remain wary of certain commercial maneuvers given the average value of these productions, but fortunately in recent times this negative trend seems to have undergone a change of course by offering games on the market that finally manage to honor the films from which they are drawn. At this point it is natural to ask ourselves whether Terminator Salvation contributes to prolonging this new and encouraging trend, or not. Desperate War In Terminator Salvation we play a young John Connor militant in the forces of the human resistance in the war against Skynet. The unequal clash between the two forces is cleverly described in the opening video that catapults us into an apocalyptic scene where humanity is cornered by the unstoppable advance of the machines, the efforts of the Resistance appear in vain and the mirage of a final victory fades. progressively in the hearts of the soldiers on the front line, disillusioned by the continuous defeats. In this desperate context, the events of the game begin: our first objective is precisely to reach the closest collection point to complete yet another desperate retreat. During our race to safety we receive a distress call from some rebels trapped beyond enemy lines, in the middle of Skynet territory, and from this moment our goal becomes precisely to come to the aid of our companions in a mission from high risk content. Basically, the story that gravitates around the Terminator Salvation video game is summarized all here, there was no transposition of the events of the film for the development of the game that would certainly have offered more ideas for basting a deeper and more convincing narrative component, here it is exploitation of the license is limited to the cold representation of the universe of the film, presenting some characters that appear in the film. Such a bare-bones narrative component also influenced the general longevity of the title, as we will see later. Skynet like the Locusts The playability of Terminator Salvation closely resembles that of Epic's famous third-person shooter, it is in fact clear that Gears of War was the main source of inspiration for the developers of the GRIN studio, the same authors of the recent Bionic Commando. The game action, taken with the now famous shot behind the protagonist, is entirely based on firefights set up on a cover system that closely resembles the one appreciated in Cliff B.'s fights against the Locusts: walls, car wrecks or whatever prove to be fundamental hiding places to escape the offensive power of the cyborgs, especially when it is necessary to carry out flanking tactics to eliminate enemies whose only weak point lies in the rear part of their metal armor. Unfortunately, the entire system does not enjoy the same fluidity and practicality as the one created by Epic, it often happens that the position of the character prevents the view from framing the opponent so that we find ourselves shooting into the wall in front of us, effectively nullifying the usefulness of cover, and even the need to press the appropriate button again to get away from hiding is not very effective in the middle of the most critical encounters. To dampen the repetition of the fighting, the sections come to the aid of vehicles, which are also rather canonical in structure: whether it is an off-road vehicle or a subway train, the aim is always to break down any hostile enemy presence to arrive safely at the checkpoint. Later in the adventure there is also the possibility of driving a mech always with the function of cleaning up the area from Skynet, in any case we are not allowed to drive anything and our task is always limited to that of gunner . Xbox 360 goals Come on all you achievement fetishes and gamescore freaks! You who are eagerly waiting for an heir of the generous King Kong to quickly increase your hoard of points, here is the Terminator who comes to your aid by offering you11 achievements waiting to be unlocked with relative ease. Thanks to John Connor, in fact, you will receive 80 points for each of the nine chapters of the game, plus 100 points for completing the normal level and 180 for the difficult level (selectable immediately). The thousand points are waiting for you! Los Angeles monotonous city The rescue mission takes John Connor through a Los Angeles represented as a post-apocalyptic war theater with ruined buildings and vegetation that invades the deserted streets. Even under this aspect, the work carried out is not characterized by originality or variety: the locations appear bare with negative peaks in the internal environments devoid of any characterization. The care and attention that other and much more famous titles have given to post-apocalyptic settings (Fallout 3 above all) is light years away. The brief interlude placed in the subway tunnels partly distances itself, but here too the sense of already seen is redundant. All this is even more surprising in the light of the fact that the game relies on a license rich in content such as that of Terminator, therefore the little care taken by the game designers in the implementation is even less justifiable, the only explanation could be that a necessary release in conjunction with the film counterpart has forced to tighten with the development times. The number of opponents to be faced in the game is also poor, so much so that during the entire adventure the types of Skynet cyborgs encountered are just six, which are repeated throughout the nine chapters, of these only one offers a tactical approach to the given clash from its rear weak point, but this is only true during the early stages of the game when we do not yet have the most destructive weapons available, which frustrate any remaining tactics leading to a further flattening of the action. Understated machines From a visual point of view Terminator Salvation is far from the peaks offered by current standards and demonstrates it in every aspect from the polygonal modeling of the characters and machines, to that of the structures and explorable areas, which are always very limited and devoid of any interactivity. Even on the texture front, the work is far from enough, if we think that the game runs on the same consoles that host eye candy such as Gears of War or Uncharted, we immediately realize how we could only expect something more. In the end, the action manages to be fun, but to make the general judgment worse there is a longevity that stands at 5 hours to complete the entire adventure, which maintains a medium-low challenge level, combined with a total absence of unlockable extras, further weakening any stimulus to replayability. The possibility of playing two-player co-op on the same console remains interesting, but unfortunately not online.", "date": "2009-06-15", "grade": "5.6"}
