{"name": "Disgaea Afternoon of Darkness - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disgaea-afternoon-of-darkness-recensione.html", "text": "Gameplay Structurally, Disgaea Afternoon of Darkness is virtually identical to its PS2 counterpart. It is a strategic game divided into 14 chapters and various sub-quests, where the battles between groups of characters of various kinds take place on a pseudo-3D map, where the gamer moves his pawns, up to 10 members of a party, against the enemy hordes. At each turn you can move your ~men~ within a certain space-movement in relation to the conformity of the area in which you are and to the characteristics (parameters) of the PCs themselves, to make them perform an action such as attacking with a weapon, a spell, a combo or simply place them in a strategic point. But contrary to other titles of the genre, Disgaea separates the phases of movement and action, treated here independently. Once you have decided what to do to a team member, the player will have to select the ~Execute~ command from the menu to make him act, otherwise he will remain stationary, in a sort of waiting. And it adds an interesting element: the Geo Panels. These are colored panels, as the English term itself says, placed on the floor of some ~battlefields~ where pyramid-shaped objects are also visible. These, called Geo Symbols, if placed on a panel of the same color, activate its additional abilities. So if, for example, a Green panel is able to give those standing on it an attack power from a distance equal to 20% more, there must be a ~pyramid~ of the same color on it to ensure that this ~boost~ is actually active. Obviously enemies can also take advantage of this system and therefore it is always advisable to be very careful when you are in similar areas. To prevent opponents from using the above powers, it is possible to use the so-called Color Combo. These are activated when a Geo Symbol of one color is destroyed on a chromatically different panel. By eliminating a Yellow pyramid positioned over a Red box, all the panels of this color will change to that of the Geo Symbol (in this case therefore yellow), inflicting a certain amount of damage to the units that are standing on them. By destroying the various Geo Symbols in the right order and in the same turn, it is possible to trigger deadly combinations, capable of wiping out anything on the panels. Laharl Castle and the Dark Assembly Once a stage has been completed, it is possible not to proceed immediately to the next one, but to return to the protagonist's castle where, in addition to checking the status of one's units or objects, one can explore the few rooms that can be visited to talk to the residents, visit the shops available for the purchase of various objects (the quality and number of which depend on what happens, as we will see shortly, elsewhere) and having his wounds treated in a sort of medical clinic where, however, one pays for the services received. Also inside the castle we find the Dark Assembly, an assembly made up of Senator demons to whom it is possible to present requests that will increase in number as the game progresses and with the growth of your mana level and therefore of the various level requirements . Here the desire to unlock new PC classes (Warrior, Thief, Magician, etc), new special maps or improve the quality of the products sold in the shops can be brought to the attention of the court. To obtain results and have the turn request voted in their favour, the player is called upon to bribe the members of the assembly, convincing them with gifts (items present in our inventory) or with beatings. When you are inside the room where the assembly is held, the player can move the cursor over the Senators to monitor their propensity or not to approve our request and adjust accordingly. Also in this session it is possible to transmigrate one's own units. What it means: to kill and reincarnate in a new Pg an element of the party that is no longer useful without losing its characteristics. In practice, this action allows a transaction of statistical bonuses from the defunct unit to the newly created one which will restart its experience from level 1, but different, boosted compared to a level 1 unit that has not transmigrated. Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness is available for PSP. The Item World The Item World is simply ~a world~ within an item in the party's inventory. Each of them in Disgaea contains a hundred randomly generated dungeons with floors that can be explored at will, or almost, since these are populated by numerous hostile creatures. Here it is possible to increase the power of the ~analysed~ object, especially weapons. Inpractice once inside an item, facing enemies on the spot and overcoming the various levels present, including Bosses, you can make it grow in power by making it ~Level-Up~ (every ten levels passed). In these cases, in fact, there is an Item-boss that can vary from a General to a ~King~ up to the ~Item God~ on floor 100, the most difficult but also (watch out when you explore the world inside the Legendary Cosmic Blade) the one that can give you more points and additional weapons, the most devastating in the game. Furthermore, inside the objects you can also encounter special monsters called ~Residents~ which, if defeated, turn into a further bonus that can be associated with the statistics of the inventory piece. It can be moved at will from one object to another, effectively freely enhancing the item of equipment that best suits us. So this is what awaits us in general. But what are the innovations present exclusively in this PSP version? First of all there is the ~ad hoc~ multiplayer game for two players in Wi-Fi. Different modes in which to compete with a friend: ~Defeat the Leader~, ~Capture the Flag~ and ~Battle~. In this mode, every gamer has access to the so-called ~Geocubes~ which have different effects in battle and require a certain extra attention to the strategic element. You can change game rules, battlefield conditions, victory options and much more. Furthermore, by connecting to other PSPs, you will have the possibility to sell or buy other items. Again: a Music Shop where it is possible to buy new songs to customize the soundtrack even in the Item World (where there is really a need) and a ~Guardian of Records~, that is a guy who takes into account everything he we do in the game, from the number of enemies killed to the items recovered. It is also possible to unlock some characters, three to be exact, from other Nippon Ichi titles. The most interesting news However, the most consistent novelty is another, namely the new game mode called Etna Mode. It, which can be unlocked once the basic adventure is finished (but there is also a trick to activate it immediately) consists of a reduced review (few chapters) of the story and gameplay through the ~eyes~ of Prince Laharl's vassal, whom the little devil kills for mistake. Like a sort of what if typical of some movies. With Etna as the absolute protagonist of the scene, humor but also the puns typical of her character rain in cats and dogs. Especially if we consider that the nice little devil will have the angelic Flonne by her side, convinced in this case that the former is a great detective and therefore anxious to act as her assistant... Afternoon of Darkness therefore ~perfect game~? Almost. On balance, the only drawback of an otherwise excellent production is perhaps to be found only in the controls. These haven't been optimized for the Sony handset, but we don't know to what extent this was intended or determined by the PSP's own design. It has only two triggers, for example, and this effectively prevents the implementation of the function of tilting the game map as was the case on PS2, which makes it a little difficult to perform certain operations. It lacks a key to quickly return to the base square and the d-pad is a little too large to be able to perform the movement diagonals well. And the problem becomes greater if you decide to use the analog, as this, being insensitive in short movements and too much in long ones, creates problems of correct positioning and advancement in the boxes. But in our opinion they are ~defects~ that do not affect the overall quality of the title that much. Aesthetically, there is nothing to complain about: it is true that the engine is two-dimensional, but it is also true that in Disgaea there is probably one of the best 2-D graphics ever. The characters are beautifully drawn and have very detailed sprites, as well as the surrounding environments and the various explorable areas appear to be very well cared for. Not least are the animations of the various characters or the ~special effects~ during the attacks in the battle phases, generally very fun to see. If we really want to make some criticisms we can do it against the menus that have not been optimized (we are talking about fonts in particular) for the portable version. The situation is different when it comes to the sound sector: the BGM in general is excellent, the soundtrack a little less. Mind you, the ~soundtrack~ is not bad, especially if we consider the fact that compared to the PS2 counterpart, where in fact there was only one music track for the Item World, for example, here it is possible, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, buy more and use themwhere and when you want, but on balance it appears a little repetitive, similar from song to song. A greater variety of styles would not have hurt, in short. Comment Disgaea Afternoon of Darkness is the excellent transposition on the laptop of the almost homonymous title available on the Sony monolith. Same graphics, same humor, same overall pleasantness both in terms of setting and gameplay. The latter offers a good level of challenge for a turn-based strategy, despite some small flaws related to the PSP controls, and which for this reason do not allow him to earn a nice 9, in the clashes and in the personalization and growth of the PCs. With its unprecedented new game modes, new battles, multiple endings, secret characters, multiplayer, etc, the Nippon Ichi product for the Sony portable console confirms itself as a solid title to be taken into consideration by fans of the genre. Pros: Good gameplay. Great longevity and good replay value. Lots of unlockable extras. Cons: Controls not optimized. Difficult in the Item World. In recent years there is a software house that for enthusiasts has become synonymous with strategic J-RPGs, a bit like Squaresoft (Enix) is for traditional J-RPGs. We are talking about Nippon Ichi, author of absolute masterpieces of the genre such as Rhapsody, La Pucelle: Tactics, Phantom Brave and the series (we are two episodes away and there are rumors of a third future chapter) of Disgaea. And the progenitor of this latest ~saga~, Hour of Darkness, finally arrives on the Sony portable console, with a new title, Afternoon of Darkness and several new features. Netherworld is a dark and hidden world that lies beneath the deepest of oceans. A cursed land populated by terrible creatures and where evil reigns supreme. In short, Hell. Two years after the death of King Krichevskoy, ruler of this reality, the situation is in chaos: in this two-year period the subjects have divided into factions and clashed with each other to take possession of the scepter, taking advantage of the fact that the designated heir of the aforementioned Overlord's son Prince Laharl slept soundly unaware of his father's whereabouts. But now the megalomaniacal young demon has awakened and with the help of his faithful vassal Etna (a female demon) and his followers, the cute but deadly Prinny, a kind of penguin-like creatures (actually they are souls of human beings who have lived without honour, such as thieves for example, who once deceased and arrived in the other world, both that of the Netherworld and that of Celestia, the ~world~ of light, Paradise, take on these features and the role of servant, slave or soldier depending on their Lords and Kingdoms) armed with machetes or bombs, as well as other characters who will later join the party (the naive angel Flonne, Vyers, etc) decide to take back what is theirs.", "date": "2007-12-21", "grade": null}
