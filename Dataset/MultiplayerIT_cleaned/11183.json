{"name": "Dream Day Wedding", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dream-day-wedding_a.html", "text": "Have you recently been invited to a wedding? You have to dress elegantly (even when you've never worn a jacket in your life!), put up with a more or less long and more or less elaborate church ceremony, wait a long time for the photo sessions and finally get to lunch. Lunch that usually doesn't start before the afternoon, and whose courses are punctuated by the entertainer on duty, sometimes with exhausting piano bar songs or, worse, various ~games~ and ~jokes~ with the bride and groom as protagonists. By the end of the day, when it's dark outside and you finally get to the wedding cake, you're stoned and feel like you've climbed a mountain. But there are also positive aspects to the wedding ceremony, right? Especially if you are getting married, or someone you know well... I-play tries to capture the emotion and magic of this very special day in its new title, Dream Day Wedding. The game has a single mode, in which we will face a certain number of stages in sequence trying to find all the objects that will be requested from time to time. If you've ever tried a ~visual~ puzzle game, you know how it works: you use your phone's d-pad to move a pointer around the screen, then press the 5 key when it's over the desired object, to pick it up and remove it from the list. The action is marked by a time limit that drops substantially when we ~click~ on the wrong object, or when we take advantage of Cupid's help to identify apparently invisible elements. After all, the charm of products like Dream Day Wedding is all here: you have to scrutinize the scenario millimeter by millimeter, trying to distinguish the shapes that interest us even when they are on something of the same color or in a very hidden area. We will find ourselves facing the same location several times, but with different objects at stake, and each stage represents something ~typical~ for any wedding: the cake shop, the clothing shop, the florist, etc. There are also some special items, the finding of which will result in extra points at the end of each level. The developers have added two bonus games to vary the action: in the first we will have to find the differences between two images that look identical, in the second we will have to identify the position of pairs of identical cards on a board. Technically, the game looks exactly as expected: with a series of rather detailed photo-realistic images that form the background in the various stages and that must be scrolled horizontally and vertically to be viewed in their entirety. The interactable objects are drawn in exactly the same way (after all the goal was to confuse them with the rest) and the use of colors is good. The animated elements are very few, therefore the feeling of static is very strong and we must keep this in mind. As often happens, the sound sector does not particularly enrich the action, it is essential and can be easily deactivated from the start. Finally, as far as the control system is concerned, we are dealing with one of those products in which a mouse would be ideal for pointer control: the d-pad cannot boast the same precision or the same practicality, it is clear but at least there aren't too many problems. PRO A good number of internships Simple and immediate Well done graphics... AGAINST ...but it's all very, very ~static~ Very limited gameplay Only for lovers of the genre", "date": "2008-09-19", "grade": "S.V."}
