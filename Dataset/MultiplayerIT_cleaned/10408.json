Let alone do it on a huge and gloomy spacecraft, hundreds of light-years from Earth. This is what happens to the protagonists of Pandorum, who find themselves aboard the Elysium and only discover after a while that the gigantic spaceship is nothing more than the last hope of survival for the human race, which has abandoned its planet of origin in search of a new world to inhabit. The Elysium was supposed to keep its passengers in a state of cryogenic sleep, preserving them from aging as it traveled through space in search of a place compatible with human life. But things did not go like this, and a large part of the ship's guests badly digested the explosive cocktail of genetic enhancements that was administered by the system, with catastrophic consequences: on the one hand, horrible mutations capable of strengthening the body but ravage the mind, on the other psychosis and hallucinations. In short, a picture that is anything but reassuring. In the game we take on the role of Corporal Bower, who together with Lieutenant Payton (the character played by Dennis Quaid in the film) must explore the interior of Elysium in search of survivors and answers. A research that, unfortunately, will also lead to the discovery of not exactly friendly life forms. Captain's log, stardate... Pandorum is basically a third person shooter with adventure elements, characterized by a plot that follows quite faithfully that of the film and a control system that allows us to independently adjust the movement of our character in the four directions and his view . The shot is somewhat reminiscent of the latest Resident Evil, with Corporal Bower seen from the back, from the waist up, and positioned on the left side of the screen so as to leave the central space free, clearly occupied by the viewfinder. Using an overlay map or relying entirely on our sense of direction, we must move through the rooms and corridors of the spaceship in search of survivors, collectibles and weapons. The latter range from a simple stick to a series of guns of different power and characteristics, with ammunition that is far from infinite. The developers of Artificial Life have only sketched out some narrative crescendo, pushing us into the arms of the mutants after just a few steps: good for the fun, bad for the atmosphere. Unfortunately it is very difficult to make the most of the dynamics of a game of this kind without a valid starting idea: if the technical skills allow it, gruesome enemies and situations of great tension can be created; if, as in this case, you find yourself having to deal with more or less heavy limitations, then you have to work with expedients and try to get the best possible result. Silent Hill on PSone did this, after all: who could ever forget all that fog? A technical expedient to overcome the technical limitations of the first, glorious PlayStation, which however turned out to be so successful as to characterize the Konami survival horror in the following years. Well, from this point of view Pandorum is as abrupt as it is unsuccessful, the mutants who try to kill us are far from scary and the entire situations of approaching the fights do not create the slightest tension. Technical realization The graphics of the game generally appear well done, especially in quantitative terms: the scenario is vast, there are many rooms to explore and a good job of characterizing the various environments has been done to avoid excessive repetitiveness. The polygonal models of the characters are unfortunately very angular: in the standard shot this is not very noticeable, but during the cutscenes the defects come to light and it is not a pretty sight. The choice of colors is good, even if inevitably the shades used are mainly dark and tend to recur cyclically. The engine manages a good number of polygons and does it convincingly, without uncertainties and without drops in the frame rate (quite fluid). The visual rendering of the weapons leaves something to be desired, but what is not convincing is above all the design of the mutants. The sound accompaniment is far from rich, but this is probably a deliberate choice. Good dialogues in English. The tested version is 1.0.1", "date": "2009-11-04", "grade": "6.0"}
