{"name": "Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo-hd-remix.html", "text": "Nearly eighteen months in development, that's a long time to fine-tune the conversion of a 1994 2D fighting game from the basis of its SEGA Saturn incarnation. An apparently unjustified time window that acquires its dimension only by experiencing how important and dramatically complex the work done was, even if not without errors. Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is therefore not only the glossy version of the best incarnation of the second chapter of the Capcom fighting game, but also a tribute, an attempt to improve it and a sort of director's cut. New balances The basic offer is known to all and requires very few premises: seventeen characters - including Akuma - to be selected and a tournament to be completed by choosing one of the four difficulties available, as much as necessary to get carried away and then jump into a multiplayer , now also online, able to occupy a life of study and practice spent weighing the virtues and weaknesses of each fighter, counting the frames and verifying the effectiveness of increasingly complex strategies. An offer that is quantitatively far from the latest ups and downs proposed by the most disparate representatives of modern fighting games, but perfect in its simplicity: the six buttons used for as many hits, the special moves and the super combos introduced for the first time by the Super Turbo are mixed a two-dimensional gameplay that eschews the obsessive squeezing of the keys in favor of a maniacal study of spaces and their control, where the planning of the missing seconds at the end of the loaded and carefully prepared shot is preferred to the speed, however adjustable sacrificing some sprites of the bar indicating the vital energy. An intrinsically complex and fascinating mosaic to which we wanted to give the final impetus by adding a completely new balance to be selected at will - and called with little imagination HD Remix - curated by an exceptional game designer such as David Sirlin, player absolute level of the series and former curator of the re-edition of Super Puzzle Fighter and a couple of collections for PlayStation 2. Putting the project in the hands of a gaming professional was a winning decision because it made it possible to modify a lot without distorting anything, making that the effectiveness of individual moves was affected without adding almost new ones: the complete list would be too long to do but the basic idea was to crush the rankings resulting from years of tournaments, weakening some wrestlers and improving others . Honda and Cammy no longer suffer mortally from the various Ryu, Ken and Akuma, while Dalshim and Balrog see some of their specifications reduced while remaining almost unchanged in style and methods of use; a few examples among many for a job that is not easy and whose effective scope - positively as well as negatively - can only be assessed in the coming months, but which is already now able to shine for courage and lucidity of intent. The options are those that can be expected and in addition to the usual training mode, including hit boxes to evaluate distances and vulnerabilities, they are declined in a local multiplayer for two people and on the Network for up to eight players, thanks to a special tournament . Nothing stratospheric but just enough to feel satisfied and not have to move from house to house in search of good level opponents to train with. Comparing old and new Initially the idea in the heads of the top management of Capcom seems to have been to redo an episode of the Street Fighter III saga in high definition, perhaps the Third Strike, their greatest pride and still unequaled summit on the 2D front; fortunately this desire has not been satisfied, otherwise and at best the players of half the world would still be waiting. In fact, creating the graphic design of this HD Remix was a huge effort, with a couple of program changes and the late entry on the scene of Udon, a specialized Japanese company and already the author of some comics dedicated to the saga. Although the animations are mostly the original ones - only the few new moves have unedited ones - the complex is exceptional and the beauty of the 1080p backgrounds and characters is certainly impactful even if the style and the trait, especially of the wrestlers , has not been taken up in a slavish way in favor of even brighter colors and cartoonish features, almost caricatured for the facial expressions. Purists aside - for them the original format is always selectable - the show for the eyes is guaranteed and there are no problems even with the new widescreen format. The only drawback and a real shame in an otherwise perfect context, they arethe infrequent but still unpleasant slowdowns that occasionally occur when the screen is occupied by more than one fireball or when a fighter's body catches fire. The sound is also excellent, also remixed and always returnable to its original shape. The tested version is the Xbox 360 one where a directional cross that is anything but perfect does not help to better manage the controls that are however reactive as one would expect and in some cases modified in HD Remix mode to meet the ergonomics of the pads - in this sense exemplary the choice to use only two keys for Balrog's loaded punches-. With a joystick things change radically but it's worth waiting for the Mad Catz ones dedicated to Street Fighter IV and arriving next February, it looks really good. Online we experience a net code of good effectiveness during the clashes, so much so that the lags are only sporadic, while the absence of a system for sorting matches according to skill would have been a useful option even if not vital, both within only the most motivated and experienced will remain to play for a few months, so we might as well enter into the perspective of having to work hard. Comment Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is the return of a masterpiece, revised in an effective and intelligent way making the most of the biblical processing times that have been granted to it. The approximately fifteen euros required to take it home are therefore well spent by practically anyone: expert users have a new balance to strip and digest in months of challenges, younger ones or up to now less close to the graphic series and online options with the date shown on the calendar, everyone online to have fun between now and the next reissue, in another fifteen years. Shoryuken! Pros Polished and deep gameplay like few others The review of the contents, technical and otherwise, was excellent Good amount of options and possibilities Cons Some sporadic slowdowns A boxed version at a budget price would have made many collectors happy Xbox 360 - Goals The 200 points offered by Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix are divided between the request to complete the game under certain conditions, that of making certain moves or winning rounds in certain ways and beating a given number of other online users. Unlocking them all is challenging but far from impossible.", "date": "2009-01-11", "grade": null}
