{"name": "Il risveglio di Remedy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77014-alan-wake-il-risveglio-di-remedy.html", "text": "After six years of intense passion and some doubts that in part survived in the finished product, Remedy, led by the usually incomparable Sam Lake, have managed to put an end to the epic of Alan Wake by finally making it arrive on Xbox 360, not without having first canceled the PC version. Alan is a writer tormented by the impossibility of continuing to write those successful books that have made his fortune, prodded by a wife who would like him to resume his business and who, in order to help him, convinces him to spend a rest period in a quiet town in the United States, called Bright Falls. In spite of the name, a dark force intertwines the life of the villagers, bringing back to life nightmares and ghosts that have regulated their existence, even indirectly, even changing the geological conformation of the earth all around. Between nocturnal demons, ghosts of alcohol and ancestral fears, Alan Wake is the story of the protagonist, who will do anything to find his wife, who disappeared on a horrible night, defeating a dark evil and some of the fears that grip him and is also an action adventure that will hardly leave those who face it with the pad in hand indifferent. When history remains a mystery Over the months there has been a lot of talk about the story of Alan Wake, of the team who absolutely did not want the plot to be leaked to the readers of sites and magazines, to the point of a news that spoke of a possible version to be reviewed that the ending just didn't contained it in order not to run risks. Having escaped this danger (we saw the ending too!), Remedy's request remains to reveal as little as possible of what happens during the game to its protagonists, leaving the writer to make it clear what it is about by focusing on the elements that season the gaming experience for the approximately 12/13 hours it takes to enjoy it without making unreasonable runs. Alan Wake, beyond the nickname of psychological thriller attributed to him by the development team, falls into the category of action adventure, with the player who is greeted by an impeccable sequence of events in a world that quickly becomes dark and decidedly inhospitable. A world in which you have to come into contact with disturbing characters, almost all very successful, who help to get to the bottom of a compelling and complicated skein. The whole gameplay revolves around the alternation between light and shadow and the protagonist's dreams that become more and more real and scary. Alan seems to be retracing the plot of a book he doesn't remember ever writing, whose pages he finds scattered throughout the forest surrounding the town of Bright Falls, while its inhabitants seem to slowly go insane. The interaction component with the characters and the narrative component are mainly entrusted to the daytime sequences, in which little else can be done except talk to the inhabitants and wander around the locations in a rather linear way. The real action takes place almost all at night, when Alan faces the creatures of darkness armed with a torch, which is used to dissolve the blanket that protects the monsters, and then eliminate them with gunfire. The quotations abound, some even too obvious like those of the ubiquitous Stephen King of whose works there are countless traces, with the shadow of the second chapter of Silent Hill making itself felt on several occasions. Compared to the Konami masterpiece, however, in Alan Wake the action component is much more successful with a precise control system that shows the pedigree of the Remedy, allowing you to launch into continuous battles to the sound of smoke bombs, flare guns and shotgun shots, with moments of true exaltation especially when things get complicated. The problem, for those who don't get carried away by the atmosphere of this fascinating forest, is that in the gameplay there is no real progression of the character, given that there are no weapons to upgrade or powers to acquire, but rather a story to to tell and to experience with a set of possibilities that accompany the player from start to finish in a beautiful place, but which is almost all lived in the dark, in the mountains and facing the inhabitants armed with axes, knives and chainsaws. In short, it all depends on the approach, if after the beautiful start you become attached to the atmosphere and to this unfortunate married couple, it will be practically impossible to give up the game and not consider Alan Wake a unique and compelling experience. Xbox 360 goals Completing the game at the basic level, taking a look at the pages of the book and the other hidden objects, leads to achieving between 500 and 600 points of the 1000 available. For the full loot you just need a little perseverance and complete Alan Wake at masth level of difficulty, collecting everything possible. It will take some time, but it is far from impossible. Give me more Once the all action part has been archived, the ~adventurous~ part remains, which thrives on very engaging interlude sequences, on a thousand details entrusted to the pages of the book, which describe everything that is not told by the narrative voice of the protagonist, and by the events that he experiences directly through the six chapters of the game which are structured like as many episodes of a television miniseries complete with musical pieces, some even unpublished, which close the various phases. The atmosphere is dictated more by silence than by too many dialogues, by a series of televisions that tell episodes of a fictitious TV serial that came verbatim from the pages of Lovecraft and Bradbury and by a radio station that collects the testimonies of the villagers grappling with the growing horror. The uninterrupted succession of breathtaking mountain views alternates with the daytime sections between rest homes for artists with psychological problems and campsites straight out of Twin Peaks and brought to Xbox 360 with a meticulous and well-finished study which however remains a bit crushed by the action component. leaving the desire to know and experience more of the life of the inhabitants of BrightFalls. In the end, just the goodness of the interaction phases of Alan Wake leaves the player wanting to have more, since they are not numerous enough to balance all those parts in which you are forced to shoot the ~possessed~ from the darkness and run away by whole pieces of scenery enlivened by rampant darkness. There are moments of emotion, narrated by an engine that manages vast expanses of trees and grass fields animated by the wind, with detailed and often interactive polygonal models, with a game that recalls what Valve did with Half-Life 2 thanks to a massive use of physics, albeit a little light, but omnipresent. Obviously, the greatest attention has been paid to the light effects, of rare beauty, especially when in the midst of a fight you find yourself surrounded by smoke bombs, signal flares, tungsten lampposts and the light of the moon that constantly illuminates the scene. Then, when the sun rises between the mountains and reverberates on the water - the opening sequence is beautiful - you really feel like you are in a remote country in the American hinterland, thanks also to a handful of driving sections that link the different maps together in a very convincing whole. The Guide and the Novel! Multiplayer.it Edizioni presents for the end of the month of May a unique guide of its kind, which brings with it all the documents, maps, biographies of the residents and a complete solution of Alan Wake. All six Episodes incredibly detailed. Including a map complete with comments. All the Objectives and Collectible Objects are shown and detailed in 240 color pages full of all the information necessary to complete this fantastic adventure! While by the end of June the Official Novel taken from the events of the game will be available for all true fans of Alan Wake!", "date": "2010-05-07", "grade": "8.9"}
