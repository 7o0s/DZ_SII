{"name": "Collection of Mana", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/collection-of-mana-recensione.html", "text": "A year after the Japanese release, Square Enix has finally decided to localize and distribute the Collection of Mana in the West as well. It has always been a mangy compilation, in some ways, which we had already given up on for a simple reason: Seiken Densetsu 3. The third chapter in the franchise, better known in our hemisphere as Mana, dates back to 1995 and has never been officially translated, although was one of the last titles to be released for the SNES but also one of the best video games developed for the 16-bit console from Nintendo. The funny thing is that no other episode of the series released since has managed to reach the extraordinary peaks of Seiken Densetsu 2, i.e. Secret of Mana, and Seiken Densetsu 3, and so, as the series became less and less popular, fans had to get the amateur translations to play the ROM in emulation. Over the years, Square Enix has tentatively attempted to turn the tide of the series amid controversial conversions and remakes. Today, however, it seems more determined than ever to regenerate it thanks to the remake of Seiken Densetsu 3, due out next year with the official title Trials of Mana: the Collection of Mana, in this sense, wants to be a tasty, but expensive, appetizer for all those who have missed these masterpieces of yesteryear. Final Fantasy Adventure The first Seiken Densetsu had a rather complicated genesis that we told you about in our Monograph on the series: in practice Square had canceled the project, only to then re-propose it later on Game Boy with a more appealing title, namely Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden. For this reason, the game was released in the West with two different titles, Final Fantasy Adventure in America and Mystic Quest in Europe. Maybe you know it like this and if you're old like us, maybe you even played it without knowing that that kind of clone of The Legend of Zelda was really Seiken Densetsu, the same game that has had two remakes over time, first for Game Boy Advance and then for mobile systems, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. The Japanese title means ~The legend of the sacred sword~ and in fact the story revolves around the phantom Sword of Mana, the only weapon capable of destroying the evil forces that are wearing down the Mana Tree, the source of life and prosperity throughout the world. It is a rather basic plot and Square made no secret of its intention to follow in the footsteps of The Legend of Zelda, however Final Fantasy Adventure - this is the official title in the Collection of Mana - rides the waves of nostalgia, thanks also and above all to the filters that allow you to change the look of the game to more accurately simulate the screen of the very first Game Boy. It's probably the best way to play a little gem that, despite some ingenuities, still knows how to amaze: the plot is more sophisticated than it may seem, and reels off some rather dramatic twists, while the level design includes some puzzles and puzzles rather ingenious that rely on dynamics more similar to an RPG than an action adventure with a top view. We are however talking about an experimental title from 1991 which, even today, manages to delight us only with the iconic piece of music by Kenji Ito. Secret of mana The second episode in the series really needs no introduction: in addition to being the most famous - and the one that, for a long time, defined the entire brand - it's also one of the best and most popular. Released for mobile devices, included in the compilation of preloaded titles in the Super Nintendo Mini and recently redone in fully polygonal graphics with mediocre results to say the least, Secret of Mana represents one of the highest peaks reached by Square Enix, and not only at the time of 16-bit. The guys at M2 who did the conversion for this compilation, and for the recent ones dedicated to Castlevania and Contra, have done an outstanding job, bringing the game back to us in its crystalline form. Unfortunately it is not possible to apply any filter to the image, which can only be significantly enlarged, even if it is still framed in a beautiful illustration. As in Final Fantasy Adventure, also in this case just press the ZL key to call up a menu of options among which saving and quick loading stand out. It may seem like a trivial addition, but in its simplicity it makes the experience even more pleasant, also because Secret of Mana, splendid as it is, is still a 1993 title with a somewhat naive placement of save points and a difficulty level not always very balanced, mainly due to the artificial intelligence of our two companions: much better to play in two, in this sense, dividingthe JoyCons. Secret of Mana manages to continue on the path already taken by the prequel, while maintaining a new direction that attempts to join the adventure spirit of The Legend of Zelda and the more RPG mechanics of Final Fantasy. The result is a riot of colours, funny divinely animated sprites and gigantic bosses to face with calm and determination: a special indicator feeds the power of each attack and is discharged immediately after it has been achieved, so if the player wants to maximize the damage he can press keys at random, but has to wait a few seconds to hit at full power. This trick makes the fights exciting and clear, without falling into the chaos of scrolling fighting games, and allows you to select objects and spells on the fly thanks to the innovative ring menu. Trials of mana The main focus of this compilation, Trials of Mana is the sequel that has been closed to us for years and which undoubtedly represented the state of the art when it was released on the SNES in 1995. Producer Tetsuhisa Tsuruzono brought together the staff who had worked on Secret of Mana and which due to time and budget reasons he had not been able to complete as he would have liked: the creators of the series, Hiromichi Tanaka and Koichi Ishii, wanted a multiple ending RPG with a more dynamic combat system and a more complex storyline. Trials of Mana is a bit of all of these things. If from a graphic point of view it even surpasses Secret of Mana, thanks to an immoderate use of Mode-7 and the greater care for animations and details, on the narrative front it seems like a game of the next generation. At the beginning of the game we can in fact choose our protagonist from six different ones, after which we will also have to choose two supporting actors who will join his adventure. There are in fact three storylines, divided between the three pairs of characters: having passed the individual prologue, and having met the other two supporting characters, the game follows the storyline associated with the main hero or heroine. This model weakens the script a bit, but makes the Square Enix title extremely replayable, also because the structure of the journey, which is already not linear in itself, changes significantly from one protagonist to another. The combat system resumed that of Secret of Mana with one important difference: the power indicator disappeared - replaced by a shooting animation that essentially performed the same function - now each hit loads a new indicator that allows the launch of some kind of super attack. The various characters differ in terms of skills and abilities in combat, which is why the points earned at each level up must be carefully distributed, and it is also possible to change classes twice, choosing between two options each time. Every mechanic of Trials of Mana has been designed to offer players some variable that can diversify games, including the day/night cycle and the calendar that determines, day by day, the effectiveness of elemental magic. In many respects, Trials of Mana was a forerunner and set standards that today seem almost obvious to us, but which in 1995 represented the future of video gaming.", "date": "2019-06-20", "grade": "8.0"}
