However, we must recognize how the authors have learned over the years to make a virtue of necessity, building a real style around this limitation of a practical nature, which translates into ten episodes to represent events that perhaps in the manga from which the cartoon is based are completed within a few pages. We were saying, they have made a virtue of necessity and understood how to manage these rhythms, filling the dialogues with long pauses, mid-sentences and very close-ups which serve to ensure that certain concepts settle, in order to build slowly (it is appropriate to say the characterization of the various characters. An approach also adopted by Japanese RPGs, which rightly share the same inspirations and the same target with anime; and this is why all the narrative part of Tokyo Xanadu, the new title by Nihon Falcom for PlayStation Vita, is unnecessarily verbose, heavy but above all stereotyped to the extreme. Which, in truth, is not necessarily a defect: one feels ~at home~ in the company of the taciturn protagonist of the adventure, Kou Tokisaka, of the serious Asuka Hiragi, of the sweet but strong Sora Ikushima, of the ~bully with a heart of gold~ Shio Takahata, the hacker Yuki Shinomiya or the rich heiress Mitsuki Hokuto, who interact with a particularly large cast of characters dividing themselves between school, side activities and part-time jobs. The famous G team The scenario is obviously that of Tokyo, specifically the fictitious area of Moriyama, ten years after a tremendous earthquake that shook the city and which seems to have been caused by a supernatural force. In fact, portals appear around the streets which, triggered by feelings of hatred, anger or jealousy, drag people into labyrinths populated by monsters and aberrations. Kou experiences this phenomenon and is sucked into a portal one evening when he tries to help Asuka, who is being bothered by two thugs; but instead it is the girl who reveals her cunning and saves the situation: after activating her Soul Device, a powerful spiritual weapon that only a few possess, she launches herself against the enemies present in the alternate dimension and eliminates them. However, Kou also discovers that he has such abilities, and so after some time and some cases solved together, a real team of ~supernatural agents~ is formed who have the task of identifying the portals around Tokyo and closing them after defeating all the creatures that lurk within them. In short, students-fighters in full Persona style, who divide their time between social activities aimed at improving their skills, as well as their ties with others, and main quests that always and in any case involve the use of action RPG mechanics on which Tokyo Xanadu is based. +36 fight! The combat system of the game, as mentioned, is in real time and is surprisingly well implemented. After customizing the controls to match Western standards (X to jump, Square to attack, Triangle to switch characters and Circle to use the special shot), you immediately realize that the challenge is not onerous but not as trivial as you would expect , especially in the more advanced dungeons, and that therefore the use of objects such as potions, perks and armor of various levels is essential to survive the increasingly consistent and dangerous waves of monsters. Each creature has a reference element and there is an ~advantage~ order that must be consulted to enjoy a tactical idea, for example by using certain characters against certain opponents. There is no shortage of bosses, which show off a good design and fairly varied attack patterns, which require a minimum of strategy to be countered. Of course, the evasive maneuvers, the abundance of specials (executable once the relative indicator is loaded) and the possibility of composing a formation of characters (although only one is used at a time) make it quite difficult to run into game over, if nothing else because in case of limited vital energy you can always pass the ball to a teammate. However, we appreciated the possibility of saving the game in two different phases inside the dungeons (outside it is possible to do it at any time), respectively at the beginning and before the final battle, so as to avoid repeating the whole sequence from scratch in case things go wrong. PSVita trophies To obtain Tokyo's fifty-two Trophieso Xanadu you have to devote a lot of time to the game and its side activities, deepen the relationship with the other characters to the maximum, defeat a large number of monsters and complete all the available quests. The contour The Tokyo Xanadu campaign, despite all its narrative artifices (and the lack of a localization of the texts in Italian, which inevitably makes long-term reading heavier), can last up to forty hours, in the context of eight chapters which are proposed as episodes of a television series, complete with an initial ~acronym~. However, the bulk of the duration lies in the collateral activities, with which it is possible to try our hand, as mentioned, in the time that separates us from the action part of the experience. Let's talk about some minigames, but above all about exploration, dialogues and simple side quests in which maybe you have to help someone find a lost object. The interface allows you to move quickly from one area to another and on the map the places to reach are indicated with an exclamation point, but nevertheless we will be free to wander around the districts of the city and appreciate the good design work fielded by the developers of Nihon Falcom, who have indeed reused many assets from their previous productions, but were still able to exploit the capabilities of PlayStation Vita well, guaranteeing in almost all cases a solid frame rate and consistent urban scenarios and well-designed, therefore not desolate or afflicted by low-resolution textures. Let's say that the most important technical limitation of Tokyo Xanadu lies in the animations, rather woody and generally incomplete, but otherwise everything possible has been done to remedy the technical shortcomings of the Sony handheld. Too bad for the uninspired soundtrack (which will inevitably lead you to mute the volume to prevent certain themes, repeated to the extreme, from planting themselves in your head), while the dialogues in Japanese are as usual well interpreted.", "date": "2017-06-29", "grade": "7.0"}
