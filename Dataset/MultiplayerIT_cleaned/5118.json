The war that consumes the world will therefore be decided not only with the use of conventional troops, but also and above all of giants at the service of this or that sovereign. The first stages of the long single player campaign of the title developed by NaturalMotion, which has over fifty chapters, see us learn the mechanisms underlying the gameplay, which works roughly like any real-time strategy: you select a group of soldiers or the titan and give them a target that they will automatically attack. The first missions focus solely on the elimination of opposing troops, but the further we progress in the story, the more the structure becomes multifaceted, asking us, for example, to reach a certain point on the map, to escort some units or to defend the position from the onslaught of hordes of enemies. A button allows you to select all of our army in order to direct its fury on a precise target, perhaps exploiting the conformation of the scenario, while the presence of different divisions (for example the archers) opens up a series of interesting strategies, not up to an RTS proper. Dawn of Titans is a solid and engaging strategy, beautiful to look at and with a rich structure Points of view The control of the troops and the view is initially a bit confusing: in order not to waste the excellent work done from a graphic point of view, the developers have seen fit to use a three-quarter camera from above, which however makes it difficult selection of targets in certain situations. Fortunately, it takes a little practice to get used to the facets of this system, which thanks to dragging and pinch-to-zoom offers solid battle management in the end. In addition to the long single player campaign, it is possible to form alliances and invade the territories of other users, a strategy that can prove useful for carrying out a little grinding as needed and scraping together some coins or some useful resources to build new buildings and fortify your base . Yes, because the Dawn of Titans experience does not end on the battlefield, but includes a management substrate with a traditional casual mold in which you have to build and upgrade the castle, the barracks, the farms, the granaries and so on, so to be able to train more troops, unlock new units and finally summon more titans. The progression of the huge warriors, substantially different from each other, leads them to level up, to use various perks and even to consider the fusion of different characters to obtain an even stronger giant. These are typical aspects of freemium productions, which in the case of the NaturalMotion-branded title bring into play a very relaxed first phase, in which abundant quantities of currency, including precious ones (rubies), are given, but which then inevitably become more complex to push to make some in-app purchases. Nothing excessive, however, and the usual energy bar is not even present to limit our attempts: we will be able to play for as long as we want, without waiting or forced breaks. No small strengths for a product which, as already mentioned, also presents itself very well on a technical level, thanks to excellent graphics and an epic soundtrack, enthralling at the right point.", "date": "2016-12-20", "grade": "8.0"}
