{"name": "Viva Piata: Pocket Paradise - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/viva-pinata-pocket-paradise-recensione.html", "text": "Almost two years have passed since the release of the first episode of Viva Piata for Xbox 360, and the Rare title is still one of the most original games available for the Microsoft console. Created by the same team responsible for the popular Banjo-Kazooie series, it is a kind of management game in which you have to take care of a garden populated not by simple animals, but by... pots. Although it hasn't been a huge success in terms of sales, the series has given rise to a spin-off in the form of a party game (Viva Piata: Party Animals) to an amusing cartoon, to a sequel just released in Italy and, indeed , to an interesting Nintendo DS conversion. We will therefore be able to manage our garden and the living pots that inhabit it thanks to the stylus and the touch screen, in an unprecedented portable dimension. The pots are not born spontaneously in the area, but settle there because they are attracted by something. Touch to believe All things considered, the rules that govern the world of Viva Piata are simple: we have a piece of land at our disposal and we can manage it in the way we prefer, by growing grass or leaving it uncovered, planting seeds and watering them so that they turn into flowers and fruit plants. The pots are not born spontaneously in the area, but settle there because they are attracted by something: each of them is unique in some way and has fundamental desires, indicated on the screen, which we must try to satisfy so that they can enter the phase of falling in love. If a pot eats the fruit it wants or wins a duel against another inhabitant of the garden, it then only needs a home and a companion of the same species to give birth to a puppy. Very often the various little creatures will get busy independently, but we will be able to influence their actions through the game interface, ordering them a particular movement or a fight. The tools available to us are indicated in the upper part of the touch screen: we can use a spade to uncover the ground or destroy any waste, a watering can to water the seeds we have planted and special tools (grass generator, fertilizer, etc. ) to do everything else. In the right area of the screen, however, the characters gradually appear where we can go to buy seeds, fruits, accessories, houses or even new pots, using the money available. Game structure Viva Piata: Pocket Paradise has three game modes: ~episodes~, ~garden~ and ~playground~. The ~episodes~ see us complete some simple missions and at the beginning they play the role of a tutorial to familiarize ourselves with the control system, which is entrusted completely to the stylus / touch screen combination: tapping on the pots and drawing lines, we can order them to move in the direction we want, while the various tools are selected from the relative icons and applied to the garden as if we were drawing on a sheet. To move we can press on the edges of the view or act directly on the d-pad, while the upper screen warns us of any news within our small habitat (arrival of new pots, clashes, dangers, etc.). At the beginning there are only four episodes, each introduced by a different interlude sequence (taken from the animated series), but their number will increase as we progress in the ~garden~ mode, which is the typical one of the series. In this case we will start from scratch and will not have any particular goal to achieve, just a numerical percentage that indicates our progress as a gardener and that increases as we enrich the garden or particular events occur. We will therefore find ourselves planting seeds, waiting for the plants to grow, and raising our pots with all the necessary patience, also because there is no way to speed up the passage of time. Clearly, we will have the possibility to save the game at any time, perhaps to take a look at the last mode, or the ~playground~. Also in this case it is a free mode, which however makes everything available to us immediately: we will be able to use all the seeds, all the objects and all the pots we want, without any limits, building a sumptuous garden without waiting for everything to made available through our progress. An excellent solution to understand what the numbers of this game are, even if the fact of revealing all its peculiarities in one fell swoop could be counterproductive, at least from the point of view of surprises. Technical realization If you are used to playing Viva Piata on Xbox 360, it is clear that you cannot expect the same graphic rendering on Nintendo DS, in particular as regards the pinatas: the polygonal models representing the little creatures are well done, but cannot compete in detail and quality with the originals. There is only one view available, from above, but it is possible to zoom with a double tap of the stylus. In this way it is possible to appreciate the goodness of the work that has been carried out for the creation of the territory and of what is found above it, in particular the effects dictated by the use of the shovel are excellent, as well as when the grass is ~drawn~ on the ground. No particular frame rate problems are noticed, even when the screen is very crowded, and the sensation is that of a fairly powerful and well-optimized graphics engine, which manages to manage everything without ever going into crisis. The sound consists of a series of short music, which starts to underline certain events, and a good number of cute and nice effects, which help create a relaxed and functional atmosphere for the action. Comment If you enjoyed Viva Piata on Xbox 360 and have always wanted a portable reduction of the game, this Pocket Paradise for Nintendo DS is the product you were waiting for. The developers of Rare have done a great job to enclose the mechanics and structure of their atypical ~life simulator~ in a well-done conversion, technically pleasing and faithful to the original. The control system via stylus and touch screen is really immediate and intuitive, even if the management of the movements of the pots could have been better: in some cases, tracing the trajectory of the movements is not very simple, especially if the goal is not within the view and you have to use the d-pad to find it. For the rest, the gameplay has remained almost unchanged: you have to proceed by taking all the necessary time, waiting for the fruits of your management but acting quickly when the case requires it. Viva Piata: Pocket Paradise is definitely not a game for everyone, ultimately, but it presents itself as an undoubtedly successful conversion. Pros Technically well done Gameplay faithful to the original Excellent control system ... Cons ... even if there are some imperfections Slow and ~reasoned~ by nature Only for fans of the genre", "date": "2008-09-23", "grade": null}
