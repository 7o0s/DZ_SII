{"name": "Spider-Man: Il Regno delle Ombre - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spider-man-il-regno-delle-ombre-recensione.html", "text": "Thanks to the release of the three films directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man now enjoys an extraordinary popularity, which goes far beyond the fundamental notions of what kind of character he is and what powers he has. On the other hand, his comic life is a continuous stagnation made up of far from astonishing ideas: the public unmasking during the ~Civil War~ saga (we don't know, moreover, for what reason - but let's say that this was a problem of ~ Civil War~ in general), or the shameful series of episodes ~One More Day~ in which he ~resets~ his whole life, just to give a couple of very recent examples along the lines of the old ~Clone Saga~. Despite the commitment and resources, the episodes of the duo Stan Lee / John Romita (we're talking about thirty years ago) remain the best ever: new characters were introduced, exciting stories were told and there was no need to ~ amaze~ that today seems essential to stir things up. And let's spread a pitiful veil over Ultimate Spider-Man, please. In the videogame field, let's say that the situation is similar: Activision took the measures to the character and managed to create excellent titles for PlayStation 2 years ago, but the transition to the next gen has definitely failed. Spider-Man: The Kingdom of Shadows therefore stands as a turning point, which could in the first instance lay a solid foundation for the future; and that on Wii, in particular, promises an above-average level of identification as usual, with the movement of the controllers used to throw cobwebs and fight. Between one mission and another we will find ourselves having to complete a huge number of more or less important objectives. Invasion of the Body Snatchers As amply shown by trailers and various previews, this new tie-in dedicated to Spidey is not the transposition of a film or a particular comic saga of the Marvel character, but rather tells an unpublished story (which in many ways refers to an event that happened recently on the pages of Mighty Avengers): during a fight with Venom, Spider-Man once again comes into contact with the alien symbiote, which in this case separates from the body of his archenemy and wraps him in the black costume that we all know . This is not a complete passage, however... apparently, Venom has acquired the ability to ~fragment~ the symbiote, with results that quickly become disastrous: passers-by who transform into crazed and dangerous creatures, roaming the streets until they don't find someone else to ~infect~, or even superheroes who come into contact with the alien life form and become possessed by it. Within hours, New York becomes a war zone, with SHIELD troops engaged in a futile struggle to stem the phenomenon. In all this chaos, Spider-Man is the only one who really knows the threat and can do something to find out where it comes from. The Kingdom of Shadows sees us take control of the web weaver a few hours before the infection, thus giving us time to become familiar with the game structure and to complete a series of ~preliminary~ missions before tackling the city's crisis. Our first expeditions will take place after meeting Luke Cage, who in exchange for our help with gangs and drug dealers will teach us how to carry out some attacks that are as effective as they are spectacular. In any case, between one mission and another we will find ourselves having to complete a huge number of more or less important objectives (~eliminate ten gangs~, ~hit twenty enemies with this blow~, ~perform fifteen attacks on walls~, etc. .), promptly reported on the radar positioned in the lower part of the screen. Cobweb throwing courses are organized Wii owners awaited the conversion of the new title dedicated to Spider-man with particular interest, due to the exclusive control system: in fact, we will be able to shake the Wii-mote and Nunchuck to hover between one building and another, throwing our cobweb and performing aerial evolutions that are really beautiful to see. It works something like this: you press the A Button to jump, then shake the Wii-mote down to throw a web and let the push carry you away. Once the momentum ends, you jump again and throw another web, controlling the direction of movement with the Nunchuck's analog stick. The developers have studied this phase in a particular way, and it can be seen from a series of details: you cannot throw a web when you are very high up, because it is clear that there are no buildings to make it adhere to; and at the same time, if we have Central Park on our right, the character will continue to throw cobwebs only on his left. We will always find a way to move quickly,however, even in the absence of buildings to exploit: by holding down the C button, Spider-Man will launch cobwebs horizontally, projecting himself forward as in a catapult, and the same mechanism can be used when you are at great heights. It would have been difficult to put a limit on what is the most fascinating aspect of the game, and so even falling from thousands of meters won't be a problem, with the character landing as if nothing had happened. Adhering to walls is different, which on the one hand offers some at least interesting ideas (the view rotates according to the case, putting a strain on our perception of space), on the other it suffers from some not insignificant problems : climbing is often a confusing and cumbersome procedure, it is very difficult to adhere to the walls of buildings after a jump and this reduces the good done with regards to swinging with cobwebs. My spider-sense itches! The motion detection system of the controllers is not limited to regulating Spider-Man's movements, but also plays a fundamental role with regard to the combat system, which is another of the elements for which The Kingdom of Shadows should have amazed everyone. The basic combo is performed by repeatedly pressing the B trigger, with a series of variants that see the continuous pressure of the same key or the combination with the A button. We will be able to throw cobwebs (trapping enemies, at least for a few moments) by pressing the Z, while pressing the same key together with C will result in the instant creation of a cobweb shield, useful for parrying various types of blows (bullets and missiles in particular). One of the peculiarities of the game lies in the possibility of changing costume at any time, with the moves and abilities that vary accordingly. On Wii, this is done by shaking the Nunchuck sideways (with a really nice visual effect); but this is not a very happy choice, since to ~lock~ an enemy you have to shake the Nunchuck downwards. Guess what happens when you try to do one of two things, maybe in a very chaotic situation, maybe when the success of the operation can lead to victory in a fight or game over? Here you are. And a very similar situation occurs with the Wii-mote: as already written, shaking the controller downwards launches a web, while shaking it sideways launches what is probably the most important type of attack in the game, with Spider- Man who uses the web to hit an opponent with momentum and then move on to the following enemies in a chain that can produce up to one hundred consecutive hits, and which is fundamental in particular in the fight with the bosses. Unfortunately it often happens that the controllers do not correctly recognize the movement, with all that follows, with the exception of the relatively quiet ~quick time events~, to be completed after fights with key characters. Technical realization The Wii version of Spider-Man: Web of Shadows follows what was seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, thus distancing itself from the two-dimensional interpretations of the game (for PS2, PSP and Nintendo DS), but the results are far from spectacular . The rendering of the buildings in the distance is good, after all those who have tried The Incredible Hulk on Wii (to stay on the theme of superheroes) will remember the absurd fog that prevented them from seeing more than thirty metres. The problem lies in the compromises that had to be made to obtain a perfectly visible city during our laps on the web, and which moreover does not put us in front of loading screens: the buildings are flat, with very few details and borderline textures of the simplistic; passers-by are few and have spartan polygonal models, not to mention the animations; moving vehicles practically do not exist, and parked cars are extremely spartan; interaction with the environment is reduced to a minimum; the frame rate is dancer and in the most agitated situations slowdowns occur; visual management sometimes ~goes crazy~, especially when we climb buildings (and managing it with the d-pad isn't the best of life, but there weren't any alternatives). The Spider-Man character is well drawn and has a good set of animations, especially during aerial evolutions, but Treyarch's graphics must have major problems with a sense of proportion: Luke Cage looks three meters tall, and so does the so-called ~beaters~, or members of gangs particularly inclined for physical confrontation. The cutscenes (available in double number, depending on the ~personality~ we decide tofollow in the various crossroads) unfortunately they are rather ~raw~, therefore very little enjoyable: honestly, we have seen better even in the times of PSone. Finally, moving on to the sound, we have a series of really very, very beautiful, enthralling music, often with a cinematographic look, which is accompanied by effects of variable quality: some are very good, others are really bizarre (see the sound of the blows of Spider -Man, similar to some ~ding!~). The dubbing in Italian is of good quality. The Nintendo DS version Just like on PS2 and PSP, Spider-Man: Web of Shadows on Nintendo DS comes in the form of a two-dimensional action game with numerous platforming elements. The story behind the game is the same, the events occur in a profoundly different way, with Spider-Man looking for Eddie Brock (Venom, in fact) to understand what is happening in the city and why. The action takes place on the upper screen of the DS, while on the touch screen we can check a map at any time (with three levels of detail available) to understand where we are and in which direction we should go to make progress. The save areas are also clearly marked on the map, from where we will be able to access a shop to spend the points earned by beating symbiotes here and there and buy new moves to enrich our repertoire. Which is not a bad idea, on the contrary it becomes fundamental right from the start: the combat system is very simple, given the 2D context, but the level of challenge is decidedly high and we will always find ourselves facing a large number of opponents in contemporary: it goes without saying that having numerous and effective attacks can make us survive longer. In case you lose a life, you have to pass a small minigame to get back into action, but this is a limited possibility until you run into game over: at which point you will have to start over from your last save. Spider-Man's abilities have been reproduced in a discreet way: the size of the stages prevents us from hovering among the buildings, of course, but we can easily resort to the option of adhering to the walls and continuing in the game we also acquire other special abilities. The technical realization is excellent, with very fluid and ~cartoonish~ animations, as well as a zoom effect that brings us closer or further away from the clashes depending on the number of subjects involved. The graphics engine manages everything without problems, maintaining a certain fluidity, while the sound unfortunately does not shine like on the Wii and remains average. Ultimately, in its simplicity, the Nintendo DS version of Spider-Man: The Kingdom of Shadows appears more successful and more solid than seen on the major consoles: if you love wall-climbing and the challenge doesn't scare you, don't miss it. VOTE: 8 Comment In its Wii version, Spider-Man: The Kingdom of Shadows stands as the best tie-in dedicated to the Marvel superhero par excellence, at least on the Nintendo console. However, this absolutely does not mean that we are dealing with a high-level product: although flying around the buildings waving the Wii-mote is quite fun, the controls and the combat system are often too confusing. The presence of the two ~personalities~ that influence cutscenes and endings (there are several), as well as the instant change of costume that also varies the character's abilities are certainly good ideas, however inserted in a context on which more work had to be done it's better. The missions and objectives are certainly numerous, in practice you are never left without doing anything, but the action is generally too repetitive and the boss fights are really long and tedious. To this we must add a mediocre technical realization (to manage the city, the detail was renounced, in fact), which is saved only for some animation and for the excellent quality of the music. In conclusion, the potential was all there, but the promise of creating the definitive Spider-Man game was once again disregarded: unless you're a huge Spidey fan, you should wait for the next tie-in. Pros Swinging from one building to another is fun Really good music A myriad of missions and objectives to achieve... Cons ...but the structure is too linear and repetitive Very confusing and often inaccurate controls Mediocre graphics", "date": "2008-11-14", "grade": null}
