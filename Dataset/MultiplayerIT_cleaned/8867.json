Contents Dynasty Warriors 9: Empire, here is Cao Cao known as the wonder Beyond an editor to create new characters based on our preferences, the fulcrum of Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires is represented by the Empires mode, in fact, which allows you to select different historical scenarios and different houses to coordinate, but without changing the purpose of our actions: lead a region to conquer all the others. We will be able to pursue this aim in the role of a supreme commander or in those of a follower, with some differences in the organization of the objectives: in the first case we will establish them from semester to semester, in the second case they will be communicated to us and we will be able to suggest alternatives, but it is not certain that they will be approved. As mentioned, the campaign presents a large number of different historical scenarios, which refer to episodes such as the Revolt of the Yellow Turbans or the Battle of the Red Cliffs, and which modify any roster available to us. By choosing one path or the other, however, the substance does not change if not marginally and the characters have very few differences during the fights. The most relevant issue, however, is the abandonment of the open world setting which had characterized the basic version of Dynasty Warriors 9 and which had proved decidedly unsuitable for the approach of the series, providing us with a substantially empty setting, highly repetitive mechanics and several technical problems. Strategic gameplay Dynasty Warriors 9: Empire, the strategy phase menu Unlike the classic musou, the gameplay of Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires consists of two phases, one strategic and one action. The first phase determines the second, in the sense that based on the objectives that we are going to pursue from time to time it may happen that we take the field and fight, whether it is to conquer new territories or defend those already in our possession, or even not. The menu relating to political strategy, in which we will have to set the conditions for our faction to achieve certain results from semester to semester, as already mentioned, is quite full of items and this unfortunately immediately creates a sense of frustration, because for each month it is possible to perform a single operation and one ends up being strongly conditioned by external agents, for example an invasion attempt to be countered. Dynasty Warriors 9: Empire, Cao Cao and his consort greet the citizens of the kingdom We will be able to manage internal affairs by indicating simple actions to be performed automatically (fundraising, obtain rations, trade, commercial development, agricultural development, but also the counterproductive looting and mass looting, which could make your subjects hate you), manage personnel based on controlled regions or work on diplomacy to forge strategic alliances. We will also be able to develop our armies by recruiting men, improving the characteristics of the troops and their defensive capacity. Finally, we will be able to walk around the kingdom, via a text menu or by actually walking in the scenario (which frankly is really ugly to look at) to interact with our officers and improve the fellowship, convince independent warriors to join our forces and even accept the proposal of a suitor and get married. Action gameplay Dynasty Warriors 9: Empire, an action sequence In the campaign of Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires our goal is to unify the country, conquering new regions one by one and defending the areas under our control from the onslaught of any invaders. Both of these aspects materialize in the action phase, which clearly incorporates the mechanics of traditional musou. Unfortunately, however, the variety of situations and scenarios really, really, really leaves something to be desired. We often talk about how much the formula of Omega Force productions has been highly repetitive and unable to renew itself for over twenty years now, but with this Empires we probably touch a pthat is difficult to equal and to justify. Dynasty Warriors 9: Empire, moving on horseback allows you to reach hot areas of the map more quickly In fact, you will find yourself doing the same, identical things every time you take the field. Where the objective is to conquer a territory, you will have to support your troops as they storm a fortress, penetrate its interior and defeat its commander. If, on the other hand, you are defending, you will have to act in reverse and prevent the soldiers from entering the fort, thus eliminating their leader. The variables are represented by the characters that we will find in the scenario, by any tactics decided before leaving (the so-called ~secret plans ~) and from our equipment in terms of weapons and special maneuvers, which however we will not be able to change as much as we might like. The unlocking and purchase of items is in fact a very limited aspect of the game, and the progression is therefore entrusted solely to the strengthening of the warriors through the normal leveling. Dynasty Warriors 9: Empire, the rams must be escorted or destroyed depending on whether you attack or defend the fortress It is clear that the serious shortcomings of Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires end up potentially discouraging even the most diehard fans of the musou genre, because we are actually talking about an experience that repeats itself for hundreds of turns, identical to itself, and which cannot even count on an advanced combat system: just enter the guard of a boss to sink the combos (always the same) until he is dead, regardless of his abilities, and possibly resort to the specials if the situation turns against us. all with a yield of impacts that is still completely inconsistent today and a few too many problems with the view, which tends to go crazy when we hook an enemy and perhaps try to fall back because we are suffering too much damage and we need time to activate a special maneuver that can restore our energy. Graphics and sound Dynasty Warriors 9: Empire, an interlude sequence highlights the quality of the terrain Even on a technical level the news is not good, unfortunately. The PS5 version of the game fortunately includes two graphics modes and one of them allows you to activate 60 fps, which makes the action phase at least more pleasant and reactive but suffers in certain situations from a fairly evident tearing and conspicuous drops. are justified in any way by the quality of the assets, especially considering the power of PlayStation 5. During the cutscenes you will find yourself faced with various embarrassing textures in terms of definition, unpretentious effects and very dated polygonal models, characterized by limited animations and woody. Dynasty Warriors 9: Empire, the war council that sets the six-month goals Once in action, as previously anticipated, we always find ourselves exploring the same scenarios, extremely generic, empty and devoid of any interactable element. The greater speed given to the character, so that he can move more quickly from one point to another on the map, takes away further ~weight~ from his actions and the final result is not pleasant to see. The pop-up of enemies, which in recent musou seemed to have been fixed, it is so strong and close in Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires that it is sometimes misleading: not seeing more opponents you will think you have eliminated them all, but you just need to rotate the view to make them reappear as if by magic. Finally, little to say about the sound sector: we liked the music on the start screen, but otherwise the soundtrack turns out to be trivial.", "date": "2022-02-14", "grade": "5.0"}
