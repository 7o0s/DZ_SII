{"name": "The_Otherside", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the_otherside-recensione.html", "text": "Trying your hand at The_Otherside review is a bit like dusting off an old 80s board game: from this point of view, the developers' goal can certainly be said to have been achieved, if we consider that the new title available on Apple Arcade tries to reproduce that type of atmosphere, with particular reference to the Stranger Things series, to involve us in games based on pawns, boards divided into boxes and ten-sided dice. After completing a short but simple tutorial, The_Otherside games start precisely from the opening of the package of the game and from the selection of the scenario and the characters that we will use to explore it, chosen from a shortlist of four unlockable protagonists by collecting experience points. This type of progression actually involves the entire experience, which can gradually become more multifaceted and varied thanks to the introduction of larger environments and a greater number of enemies. Gameplay Within a strict turn-based system, our goal in The_Otherside is to identify a series of spiritual anchors on the map and destroy them, making the scenario lose the typical characteristics of the upside down, the alternative dimension seen in the Stranger series Things, and you're back to normal. Once we have carried out this operation for the entire setting, we will be able to reach the exit and successfully conclude the game.Each character has a certain amount of action points, which he can spend to make movements, look for resources or attack with one of the weapons in his possession. Searching inside the boxes leads to the discovery of objects useful for our defense (pistols, rifles, machine guns, but also clubs) or reveals the anchors we mentioned above, which can be destroyed through a simple preset action. To put a brake on our exploration speed there are obstacles, represented by closed or bolted doors, which require action points to be opened, and naturally by enemies, which appear on the map when the game ~draws~ a card and can belong to four different types of monsters, gradually more powerful and resistant. Deciding to attack them involves a roll of dice: by obtaining a value greater than three we will be able to inflict damage on them, but there are weapons that allow you to roll two dice at the same time and therefore return a greater probability to eliminate the opponent with a single blow. Technical realization In short, the basic system of The_Otherside is all too simple, it refers to the long tradition of boardgames but also structurally it does not boast who knows what complexity, focusing solely on the random generation of content to give a minimum of variety to the games and, of course, on the system of progression that gradually unlocks new characters, new enemies and larger maps. The problem is that the technical realization appears really basic, and seems to use the board game-style graphic representation as a mere expedient to deliver us an experience extremely static, devoid of any animation, characterized moreover by a rudimentary interface. The settings can be zoomed and rotated as desired, but this does not change their extremely basic and flat connotation, especially as regards the choice of some colors and some textures. However, the situation does not improve thanks to the sound sector, made up of very trivial and from an extremely repetitive background music based, needless to say, on 80s synths.", "date": "2020-05-15", "grade": "6.0"}
