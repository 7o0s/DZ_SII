{"name": "Oscuro risveglio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155778-stasis-oscuro-risveglio.html", "text": "Space can be terrifying, as the most horror sense of science fiction teaches us. The large black background of the universe hides disturbing mysteries, demonstrating its greater restlessness not so much by relying on the classic and obvious enemies that come from outside, or the aliens, but rather by dramatically amplifying the sense of loneliness and bringing out the worst nightmares, which are those that are born from the depths of man. For this reason, we can find traces of that Alien who has often been mentioned as a source of inspiration for Stasis, especially in terms of sets and general atmospheres, but the horror of this game relies on different roots, closer to human nature and to its worst aberrations, capable of creating the worst nightmares. Although various other possible sources of inspiration emerge (Event Horizon and Pandorum between the films or Sanitarium and System Shock as regards video games), the narration is quite original, reinterpreting some well-known elements of science fiction and horror in a rather unprecedented way and thus supporting the excellent atmospheres developed to stage it. Ultimately, as related by author Chris Bischoff, Stasis is a story of family and the journey of an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation, but the journey is harrowing and touches deeply disturbing elements while pursuing the simple and natural premise of a a man who wants to find his wife and daughter, composing an experience capable of striking and remaining in our company even after the relatively few hours required to conclude it. This is probably the strong point of Stasis, a difficult alchemy achieved thanks to a careful study of the rhythms and a script that is not afraid to upset the player by going beyond the canonical certainties of the video game (and of graphic adventure in general), finding a particular identity beyond its classic graphic adventure structure - which is not without some flaws - and some genre clichs that inevitably emerge in a title that also relies on tried and tested horror and science fiction suggestions to build tension. Stasis tells the story of a man's sci-fi journey to hell in search of his family A bad situation John Maracheck and family were supposed to travel in suspended animation to Titan, in what was supposed to be a peaceful journey to a pleasant destination, but something went wrong. John abruptly awakens from cryostasis in an unknown environment, a large ship apparently deserted and strewn with blood, corpses and dilapidated structures which he discovers is called Groomlake and belongs to an unscrupulous corporation, engaged in mysterious medical-scientific activities which apparently have escaped by hand. Shocked and still confused by the event, John's first thought obviously goes to his family and he immediately sets off on the painful path of investigation and discovery in search of his wife and daughter, the only hopes that man clings to to resist the delusional madness at which the ship's nightmares seem to push him. What happened to Groomlake? Why is it there? Where is his family? What is this ship in truth and what is the nature of the horrors that surface within it? Obviously we cannot analyze the plot in detail here but we limit ourselves to saying that Stasis is a story that deserves to be lived intensely. While not presenting elements of great break with certain sci-fi/horror genres, the construction of the protagonist, his lucid descent into Groomlake's delusional hell and the investigation into the depths of human madness manage to emerge and remain impressed for a long time even in the within the current richness of the genre videogame panorama. The author's use of environmental narration to tell John's odyssey is remarkable: the sense of loneliness could be ruined by an excessive use of dialogues and other characters, so the story emerges above all starting from reading messages and computer logs and PDA, primary sources of information on the history of the ship and on what seems to have happened, without ever being too exhaustive and thus leaving ample room for maneuver for the player's imagination. More than a precise chronology of events, therefore, they have to do with points of view, partial and fragmented information that make us deduce, piece by piece, the obscure puzzle that lies behind the surface of the Groomlake, between glimpses of the almost normal life of the crew before the catastrophe, gossip and thoughts that gradually become suspicious, fears and delusions noted in the diaries that contrastyear with the aseptic and categorical as well as cryptic instructions from above recorded in the on-board computers. In this narrative optimization, the descriptions of the various elements of the scenario are also very functional, appearing automatically by passing the pointer over the sensitive elements, providing a continuous flow of information and suggestions without interrupting the action with dialogues or monologues. Italian? Will arrive! The version currently available on Steam does not contain either spoken or written Italian, but as reported a few days ago the problem should be solved in a short time by Adventure Productions, which has entered into an agreement with The Brotherhood to distribute a new version of Stasis, both digitally and in retail format, in Italian. There is still no precise launch date for this edition but it should arrive by the end of October. Point, click and theme Stasis draws on the historical tradition of adventures, presenting itself with the classic point and click structure of the genre, with simple inventory management and interaction with various elements of the scenario. The mechanics are streamlined to the point of offering a low amount of slots for items to carry around, as well as few sensitive objects with which you can actually interact (except for purely descriptive ones), but this does not mean that the puzzles are of simple solution. On the contrary, Stasis offers a truly high-level challenge even for industry experts, also given the total lack of suggestions and advice, both in terms of interface and contingent, given that we actually find ourselves alone to face the problems, without no one who can help us out. Such an approach, in a videogame panorama now too accustomed to advice and tutorials, is certainly welcome and also works very well in giving the right sense of satisfaction with the resolution of the various puzzles. At the same time, there is also a certain arbitrariness in the design of some puzzles which in certain cases follow a logic that is difficult to deduce, or they can fall into the old pixel hunting, given that it often happens to leave out some fundamental objects because they are actually confused and not visible at first glance in the scenario, forcing frequent back-tracking in the desperate search for some possible element that has escaped to get out of the frequent situations of total stalemate in which we can easily run into. In short, here too we find two of the historical defects of the adventures, practically intrinsic to the genre itself, which can easily affect the pace of the game and also lead to a certain frustration but on the other hand certify that this title belongs to the historical elite of classic adventures. What is really special about Stasis, in this sense, is the ability to put the player in front of situations of great impact, subverting canons and fixed points and striking not only with the force of the narrative but with the request to make decisions disturbing, because sometimes the solution of the puzzles necessarily passes from the voluntary descent into the depths of nightmares. Space hell The low-budget production has prompted the developers to adopt ~ancient~ technical solutions to stage such an ambitious project, taking advantage in particular of the isometric shot that allows you to give a good depth effect to two-dimensional scenarios. Moreover, it is a stylistic device that always remains very fascinating, also recently taken up by various indie productions for its ability to illustrate particularly detailed settings and a good depth of field of vision. The graphic style, although derivative in various respects, is well cared for and detailed, in particular as regards the study of lights and shadows capable of giving the right dynamism and cut to the scenes, with the only notes that could be made towards some animations of the protagonist a bit mechanical and apparently unrelated to the background, but these are small things. On the other hand, the somewhat lacking pathfinding of the main character is more annoying, which often forces you to perform considerable gymkhanas with the pointer to reach certain areas of the scenario. In any case, if we consider the size of the team and the allocated budget, the production is still of a high level, a real labor of love and passion on the part of Chris Bischoff and his companions, who in the long years of development have packaged handcrafted a real pearl of graphic adventure, albeit partially raw. The audio sector, on the other hand, is practically perfect, skilfully mixingThere is an excellent selection of ambient sounds and musical clips to adequately accompany every single moment of the game. More than a side element, the sound also rises to narrative and scenographic support, marking John's progression in the maze of Groomlake with sounds that never let the tension drop and give a sort of disturbing vitality even when the scenarios present themselves graphically immobile.", "date": "2015-09-09", "grade": "8.5"}
