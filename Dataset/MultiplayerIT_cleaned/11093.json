{"name": "Fallout 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fallout-3-recensione.html", "text": "A humanity on its knees Set around 2277 with a small prologue that kicks off about 19 years earlier, Fallout 3 is the perfect representation of a dramatic post-atomic future where humanity risked extinction due to a sudden and lightning-fast nuclear war unleashed by man in 2077. Up until a few years before the terrifying event, the human race described in the game was still experiencing a full economic boom resulting from a peculiar technological evolution that has always been the trademark of the series. While on the one hand we find sentient servant robots, flying machines and every type of comfort, on the other the humanity represented has remained anchored to the stylistic, architectural and costume choices of the 50s and 60s of the twentieth century. Billboards, furnishings, looks, everything has a typical post-war style and even computers seem to have remained stuck in terms of technological evolution, still stuck at green phosphor terminals with menus and command line interfaces. It is on this scenario that our protagonist will take his first steps, once he has passed the original and stimulating tutorial inside Vault 101, home to several generations of holocaust survivors. In this bunker our avatar will be born and, only on a theoretical level as the narrative voice says at the beginning of the game, he will have to die, as the Vault is sealed from the inside and a real ecosystem in its own right where no one can enter or leave. The game then opens with a series of flashbacks that guide the player to the plot that is the background to the whole story and in parallel guide him by hand in the ingenious creation of the character. In the first moments of the gameplay we will see our father, with his face covered by a sterile mask, pull us out of our mother's womb during childbirth; we will therefore be able to choose the sex of the protagonist and immediately after the adult projection of his physical features. So we will take our first steps on all fours helped by our widowed parent and, thanks to a small illustrated book that reminds us how SPECIAL we are (i) we will be able to choose our basic statistics. This first acronym (S for strength, P for perception, E for stamina, C for charisma, I for intelligence, A for agility and L for luck), in fact represents the characteristics of the character because, let's face it right away, Fallout 3 has suffered very few simplifications to meet a less savvy and casual audience typical of consoles: it remains to all intents and purposes a role-playing game. Still more flashbacks will guide us to take the G.O.A.T. which will provide us with valid clues on the professions most suitable for our style of play through a real aptitude test which can still be tampered with to manually select the attributes of the skills available in the game (there are 13 in the game and they range from weapon proficiency, to skills in speaking and in dealing, to arrive at medicine and science). And, out of the blue, due to the succession of events of which we will practically only be spectators, we will find ourselves in the midst of an escape and, suddenly, dazzled by the light of a world that everyone, in the claustrophobic Vault 101, gave for desolately devastated. What's left of the earth Once the HDR has been disposed of, your pupils will be invaded by an incredibly detailed and extensive scenario as far as the eye can see. As with Oblivion, the game world of Fallout 3 can immediately be traversed far and wide by the player who will have total freedom to choose how to continue in the course of the adventure: follow in the footsteps of a father lost in a desperate escape and reach Megaton, the first human outpost that we can visit, or wander aimlessly in the wonderful post-atomic scenario? The artistic level is practically perfect with streets and overpasses gutted by atomic bombs, urban conglomerates devastated by radioactive winds, shopping malls, museums, shops and, in the background, reachable after a very long walk, what remains of the White House. Fallout 3 in fact, unlike the other titles in the series, takes place entirely in a desolate Washington D.C. (renamed Wasteland Capital for the occasion) complete with really existing neighborhoods and monuments skilfully recreated and then destroyed by the passage of the nuclear holocaust. Everything is incredibly detailed in its representation and, even if the houses are quite similar to each other in structural terms, the interiors show an attention to design that leaves you amazed. Toys scattered around the rooms, utensils piled up in the kitchen, a car in what remains of a garden. Everything truly reveals the escape and the horror of the instantaneous vision of the fnuclear nail. In terms of stylistic involvement, this third Fallout very much reminded us of the amazement felt in playing the first few hours of BioShock. And no better compliment can we pay Bethesda's project. As mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph, Fallout takes up the gameplay style of Oblivion, proposing a main quest that the player can follow and carry out freely and according to his style of gameplay and a whole series of secondary quests, more or less related to the plot main narrative which, even if they do not surprise in total number, tend to be extremely in-depth and very complex, with numerous steps to be carried out. If conceptually the game can be finished in just over 20 hours by rigorously following only the main quest, you will easily find yourself investing 50-60 hours of your free time to carry out even the easier to find secondary quests and you will be able to reach the goal of 100 hours if you decide to start looking for every single location in an attempt to interact with every character that populates the playing area. for them the satisfaction and involvement will be endless once they have cut their teeth in this unforgiving world What's left of the earth There is an endgame, indeed a real ending that will also act as a synthesis of all the choices made by you during the gameplay and if you want to go back to exploring the rest of the game world, you will have to reload a previous save. Wanting to come up with some notes already, we feel like pointing out some aspects of the interface and gameplay that could make the gaming experience uncomfortable and perhaps even frustrating for those less accustomed to RPGs. At any time, thanks to the legendary Pip-Boy 3000 (a special bracelet that acts as an interface for managing every aspect of the player, from stats to inventory, through radioactivity, map and vital energy) that is given to us at the end of our tenth year, we will be able to access the quest screen and select one to make active. In this way a convenient cursor will appear on the game map to direct us to the location where it will be possible to carry out the objective. The problem is that this doesn't always happen. In fact, for some quests, we will have to move without indications and, thanks to the fact of not having a sort of log of the conversations, it will sometimes happen that we will no longer be able to remember the indications given by the character with whom we dialogued when taking the quest and thus no longer have reference points to understand where to go and what to do. In parallel to what has been said, especially in the first hours of the game, you will find yourself walking a lot (definitely too much) around the game world in an attempt to reach the areas of the various quests. If nothing else, once discovered, it will then be possible to reach them through the game map with the very convenient fast travel function. And finally, always linked to these infinite initial wanderings, Fallout 3 is a ruthless game like the world it represents and the difficulty curve is very steep as soon as you set foot in Wasteland Capital. Mutants and humans raid everywhere while you're armed with a baseball bat and, if you're lucky, a pistol with a handful of bullets. The first hours of the game are all an escape waiting to make the first trades and pass the first experience levels. Venial sins, just wanting to look for the needle in the proverbial haystack, but we feel we have to point them out because somehow they tend to make the gameplay not really suitable for everyone but only for those who really want to immerse themselves in this alternative future. For them, the satisfaction and involvement will be endless once they have gained experience in this unforgiving world. RPG or FPS? But let's move on to the more role-playing aspects of Fallout 3. First of all, the leveling system which significantly distances Bethesda's new work from what we saw in Morrowind and Oblivion. The character can rise up to the twentieth level by filling a unified experience bar that rises by completing quests, killing enemies, completing conversation tests, but also by disarming mines, picking locks and hacking terminals. Each of these actions will give certain experience points, and once leveled up, the player will be given the choice of skills to upgrade. In fact, unlike the Elder Scrolls series, it will not be necessary to train the individual skills that you want to enhance (you know what we mean: hours of swimming in the water or constant jumps in the game world to enhance acrobatics): once you pass a level, you will have a certain amount of skill points is available that we can invest in the skills we prefer without any limititation of sorts. In addition, for each level reached we will be able to select a perk, a sort of always active bonus that ranges from the increase of basic statistics to the enhancement of skills, to get to help based on the context such as a perk that will allow the player to have special choices of conversation with women or perks that allow the character to regenerate his life energy when exposed to sunlight. In all there are more than 50 available and many can be upgraded to levels, which is equivalent to a decision to be made with adequate weighting given that in the course of the adventure we will be able to select just a third. It should also be emphasized that all enemies tend to level up with the player and are therefore not dependent on the game areas in their difficulty. In this way, once you reach the maximum level (the twentieth) you will not feel like demigods around the world, but the challenge level will still be kept quite unchanged even if Bethesda has seen fit to always leave some low-level opponents to ranged slaughter with a single headshot or a nice critical laser blast to the chest to see him writhe while disintegrating. The other peculiar and much praised aspect of Fallout 3 is its combat system. The game is in fact an RPG with a clear shooter action influence. In fact, by default the view is in first person  la Oblivion and it will therefore be possible to fight as you do in any self-respecting FPS even if the power of the weapon and, above all, its precision, will be heavily influenced by the character's skills rather than by aiming of the player. Fallout 3 shows all its cruelty with heads that are pulped or blown off the body in case of critical damage, limbs detached, bodies disintegrated or set on fire RPG or FPS? Crucial therefore becomes the VATS system (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System), much praised since the announcement of the sequel. By activating this particular mode, the game is paused and it becomes possible to aim at the individual parts of the body of the enemies in front of the player: the head, the chest, the limbs and even any shouldered weapons. Each section of the body is marked with a percentage value representing the probability of hitting the part and its remaining life. Additionally, by targeting these areas, it will be possible to see how much overall damage is done to the opponent if hit. Obviously each of these factors is directly influenced by the statistics and skill of the weapon being used and also by the possible crouched position of the player, in addition to the distance from the enemy. By selecting the area to hit, you will spend certain amounts of Action Points and once you have made your tactical choices, you can restart the action to see the consequences of your choices. In doing so, the game enters a sort of cinematic mode where, with a third-person camera, the player and the outcome of the blow on the enemy will be shown. On this occasion Fallout 3 shows all its cruelty with heads that pulp or jump away from the body in case of critical damage, limbs that detach, bodies disintegrated or set on fire and so on. The result is pleasant and highly addictive and at the same time offers the player a completely original and tactical style of gameplay. In fact, the Action Points are limited, so it will be necessary to carefully choose who to hit and where to hit him (genius for example aiming at the grenade that the enemy is about to throw; we'll let you imagine the results), because once these points are finished, it will necessarily be necessary to switch to FPS mode and try to finish off the enemy in real time, or run away waiting for the AP to recharge and VATS can be used again. The system is very pleasant and immediately usable due to its simplicity, even if a small criticism can be raised. Except in exceptional cases, such as the example of the bomb mentioned above, you will always tend to aim at the chest as it is the most easily hitable area. Or, at particularly close range, there will be a tendency to hit the head as it is the one that leads to the reduction of the enemy's life most quickly. It is very difficult to hit the arms or legs, because the reduction in aim or speed of the opponent has a very limited utility and that comes into play only when the enemies to face are multiple. More gameplay details As for the enemies, our alter ego is also subjected to the same double damage: on the one hand the general life and on the other that relating to the different parts of the body. To recover the total life it will be possible to use the stimps", "date": "2008-10-30", "grade": null}
