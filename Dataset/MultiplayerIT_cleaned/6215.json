Even worse: it was not a normal loss due to carelessness of the interplanetary baggage handling personnel, but a deliberate attack on the placid individual, perpetrated by the mysterious Junker, an alien who seems to have little edifying plans for the precious cargo of E. As if this were not enough, the race in search of the stolen goods is further complicated by a sort of coup d'tat that broke out in the Big Moon base, with the evil Meeks aliens intending to take control of the area and to complicate things considerably, also considering an evident concurrence with Junker and his mysterious plans. Luckily, E can count at least on the support of an unexpected adventure companion, or the android ~Combat Assured Secure Inventory~, for CASI friends, essentially a sort of animated briefcase capable of performing various actions and assisting the protagonist in all different game situations. In practice we are faced with a sort of platform game with adventure elements in which we must simultaneously manage the strange pairing of characters grappling with various platforms, mechanisms, enemies and traps by exploiting the specific skills of each and the coordinated action between the two , with extensive use of switches, levers and assorted mechanisms that allow you to reach new areas of play. The control system is extremely simplified and intuitive, requiring short and fast movements on the screen to indicate the direction to be taken by the characters, which otherwise can adapt to situations in a semi-automatic way, in particular as regards jumps. It is a solution that makes movement on the screen very pleasant even if it leads to some inconvenience in the most agitated situations. Lost luggage on an intergalactic base and an alien uprising in progress: stressful day for E and CASI The strange couple An almost constant element in level design is the presence of enemies, with which it is necessary to deal with to continue on one's path and which also represents the greatest limitation in the structure of Tales from Deep Space. The application of shooter-style action elements is not a simple thing to do in a basically adventure platform, especially when dealing with a semi-automatic or indirect control system such as the tactile one used in this case, therefore the The insistence on combat often comes across as more of a hindrance to the pace of the game than a stimulating element. The alternation between the two characters and the possibility of dealing with situations in different ways, however, manage to remedy the problem, keeping Tales from Deep Space always on excellent levels in terms of involvement. It is clearly an adventure matrix game, the puzzles represent the backbone of the entire structure and despite their general simplicity they are always pleasant, thanks also to the assortment of different skills and interaction possibilities of the two usable characters. The level design does not reach particular qualitative peaks but always remains on an excellent level, not excessively demanding but just enough to keep the challenge open until the end. The excellent characterization chosen to represent settings and characters also contributes to the positive judgment, together with the great care shown by the Frontier team in the technical realization, always taking into account the mobile context. The cartoon effect is perfectly successful and the general humor creates an apt climate, which gives a particular tone to Tales from Deep Space.", "date": "2015-07-09", "grade": "8.3"}
