{"name": "Battle of the Bands - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battle-of-the-bands-recensione.html", "text": "Fighting with music The main mode of the game sees us select our band from the eleven available, all made up of really colorful musicians and divided by genre between rock, hip-hop, country, Latin American and marching music. Once this is done, we will have to gradually conquer all the territories by beating the various groups based on different songs, presented in the form of covers. The screen is vertically divided into two parts, and the usual sequence of beats scrolls in the lower area of each, which we have to replicate trying to get the time right as precisely as possible. There are five types of ~swipes,~ which see you flick the Wii-mote left, right, down and forward, or wave it like a magic wand. Each beat replicated earns us more or less points depending on the accuracy, and at the end of the piece the band with the highest score wins. Of course, the action is not focused only on precision, on the contrary: we will literally have to fight with the opposing group, shooting at them bullets of various types or objects that prevent them from replicating the jokes. Using the A button we will be able to select the type of shot we want to launch, and then fire it in combination with an apt joke. On the other side of the screen, the opposing band can try to defend themselves (by pressing the trigger B a ~shield~ is activated, which however lasts a very few moments and therefore must be used with the right timing) or go on the counterattack. One of the peculiarities of Battle of the Bands is that the songs will be reproduced in the musical style of the group that is having the upper hand at that moment: if you have chosen a rock band, you will listen to the songs reinterpreted in that key, but they can suddenly change ~tone~ and switch, for example, to a Latin American style or even a musical march. One of the most immersive phases of the battle occurs when the jokes turn into bombs in the shape of a skull: reproducing each hit results in the launch of a projectile at the opponent, who in turn will be able to do the same. This is the moment in which it is essential to know how to activate the shield promptly... One of the most immersive phases of the battle occurs when the jokes turn into bombs in the shape of a skull: reproducing each hit results in the launch of a projectile at the opponent, who in turn will be able to do the same. Technical realization The graphics of the game are very simple, with rather angular and poorly detailed polygonal models. Let's say that the developers wanted to communicate at least one idea, and they certainly achieved that goal: the members of the various bands have an appearance that varies according to the musical genre played but also according to ~themes~ very specific, as can be that of zombies, vampires or ~urban~ style. The scenarios are also very diversified but essential, while the icons of jokes and ~weapons~ are always legible. As far as the sound is concerned, which is more important than ever in such a product, unfortunately things are not going very well: the repertoire of available songs is quite large, but far from ~important~. It is clear that playing on the basis of little-known songs burns much of the fun, and unfortunately we must add to this that the quality of the covers very often leaves something to be desired (~Is it any wonder~ by Keane, for one thing, is unlistenable). The possibility of ~switching~ at any time between one style and another is still interesting, and among other things it is freely re-presented in the option that allows you to play the songs as you like. The control system, as mentioned, is based only on the Wii-mote and its movement detection system: precision is not lacking, even if you need to get used to how the game wants the movements to be performed. Comment Battle of the Bands is a very simple game, with a rather limited structure: facing one band or the other does not involve particular differences, so in the end, to complete the stages, all you have to do is ~play~ all the songs in the repertoire. The possibility of upgrading the ~weapons~ between one fight and another changes the cards on the table, but only up to a certain point: the substance remains the same, with the jokes to get right and the ~fight~ phases to be managed in the smarter way. The graphics are really essential, and unfortunately it cannot be said that the sound sector is characterized by great quality: the covers are often ugly, and their greatest quality lies only in the instantaneous change of style. In short, on paper Battle of the Bands is anything but an exceptional product, but on Wii it has practically no direct competitors (since you playwith only the Wii-mote, without the need for expensive external peripherals) and is certainly offered at an interesting price: in terms of arguments they are not bad. Pros Simple and immediate The ~change of style~ of the songs is nice It is played with only the Wii-mote and the price is aggressive Cons Limited game structure Quality of the covers far from exciting Technically mediocre", "date": "2008-06-16", "grade": null}
