{"name": "Tekken 7: Padre mostro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183995-tekken-7-tekken-7-padre-mostro.html", "text": "PC users have been waiting a lifetime to play an episode of Tekken; since the inception of the franchise on the first PlayStation, in 1995, when the RISC architecture and technological ruthlessness gave consoles a substantial computational advantage over the x86 machines of the time. The announcement of the debut of the seventh chapter on the Windows platform has therefore created a great mixed enthusiasm, however, with a certain degree of skepticism: the Unreal Engine 4 is a widely tested engine, but Bandai Namco would have been able to make a conversion quality? The answer, we say it right away, is yes: Tekken 7 runs on PC in an excellent way, net of some small technical ingenuity that will certainly be fixed in a short time. Family business The review of the console version will provide you with all the details on the gameplay, characters and structure of Tekken 7, but a small recap seems necessary. From a narrative point of view, this episode, as mentioned, puts an end to the fight between Kazuya Mishima and his father Heihachi, a clash of unprecedented violence that has taken various forms over the years, effectively placing both characters on the side of the ~bad guys~. This time, however, light is shed on the death of Kazumi, Kazuya's mother, and on the role played by the evil Akuma in the whole affair. The campaign lasts about three hours and there is no shortage of surprises and twists, without encroaching on ridiculous situations but with an excessive heaviness of the additional ~graphic novel~ style cutscenes, in which the narrative voice of a journalist tells the progress of his investigation about the Mishima family: fortunately it is possible to skip them. As planned, during the story you take on the role of different characters and it is therefore necessary to relate to many fighting styles, although the degree of difficulty never gives rise to major concerns (at least at the ~Normal~ level) except in the final stages, when the requirement to slip to the side using the same command as the jump highlights all the limitations of normal controllers and a setting that the developers could have reconsidered. These shortcomings come to the surface in particular during the extra fight that is unlocked at the end of the story mode, when it becomes really complicated even just to approach an opponent who does nothing but ~spam~ attacks from a distance. In addition to the normal series of fights, the campaign also boasts an equal number of ~extra episodes~ that bring other characters into play, showing the fight from multiple points of view but adding very little to the narrative. Time brings advice Without considering spin-offs and free-to-play interpretations, almost eight years separate the release of Tekken 7 from the previous chapter: a huge amount of time for a videogame franchise, which however allowed Katsuhiro Harada and the developers of Bandai Namco to carefully observe the evolution of fighting games and take note of the elements that could have introduced in this new episode. In the first place a focus on progression, obtained not only through the inclusion of the aforementioned campaign and a different arcade mode for each character, but also and above all by rewarding the users' commitment through the release of numerous objects for the aesthetic customization of the fighters. There is a mode designed specifically for obtaining these extras, which are however also unlocked with the use of the game's virtual currency, which can be obtained in various ways, including by winning the intriguing online tournaments. The latter undoubtedly represent the strong point of the multiplayer offer, although on PC there are still some insecurity of the servers (it has also happened to experience a bit of lag) and the open rooms are not many: with a maximum number of eight participants, we proceed with a double round (the standard one and the one reserved for those who started with a defeat) and the possibility of attending the matches of other users to deceive expectations, to then see cash prizes awarded to the top three classified. In addition to obtaining extra items for customization, the coins can also be used to revisit the entire Tekken saga through the original cutscenes and rich galleries: a nice idea, with a rightly celebratory flavor. Fresh meat The developers of Tekken 7 have done a balancing act for the entire roster, but it is clear that the spotlights are particularly on the new entries: Katerina Alves, a Brazilian Savate expert, equipped with various combos that are very easy to run and therefore definitely suitable for novice players; Claudio Serafino, powerful Italian exorcist dubbed in our languageua (all the characters in the game speak in their own language, with subtitles in Italian: the effect is very interesting); Shaheen, a Middle Eastern warrior who is also equipped with rather immediate and simple to execute sequences of blows; Lucky Chloe, a damned hard-hitting cat-suited otaku; Master Raven, a ninja equipped with bionic grafts who pulls out a devastating katana when needed; Josie, a Filipino girl expert in kickboxing and Eskrima; Gigas, a huge and mysterious being, much faster than one might expect; Jack-7, the latest revision of the robot seen since the first episode of Tekken; Kazumi Mishima, worthy wife of Heihachi, who shares various maneuvers with him and Kazuya; and finally Akuma, which intriguingly mixes the typical moves of Street Fighter with the strategic approach of Tekken. To the basic movements, which take up the tradition of the series, rarely lingering on the crescents and focusing more on the key sequences, new and interesting maneuvers are added; on all the Rage Art, which can be used when you have little energy and which allow you to literally turn the tide of the battle, enriching the gameplay with a further tactical element. The PC version Tekken 7 focuses on performance even at the expense of definition, as demonstrated by the console versions of the game: a resolution lower than 900p is used on the standard PlayStation 4, on Xbox One it does not go beyond 720p, on PlayStation 4 Pro it reaches 1080p but in all cases the sixty frames per second remain solid. The frame counter present in the PC edition, which not surprisingly turns red when this value is not respected, allowed us to comfortably check the performance on the configuration we used for the tests, also thanks to a rather generous amount of options . In fact, it is possible to change the resolution, activate or not vertical synchrony (which, however, has some problems: it is better to use that of the control panel of your video card), select a general preset among different possibilities or fine-tune the various items: proportions of the rendering (which basically performs supersampling or downsampling as needed), anti-aliasing (however it is not possible to choose the type), shadow settings, texture quality, effects quality, post-processing quality and dynamic modification, which dynamically changes the quality of the render to keep the frame target. We were able to play at 4K and 60 frames per second by lowering some settings, experimenting with curious slowdowns at 1440p and arriving at the conclusion that to avoid any performance problems during online games it is advisable to stay on 1080p. In fact, there are sequences in which the graphics struggle a little too much, see the overflowing effects used for the match preparation screen, all naively calculated in real time, or the predetermined sequences, Rage Art included, in which one inevitably falls below sixty frames per second. Sins of youth (in particular the management of 1440p, but also a problem with the post-processing effects, which tend to ~dirty~ the image, which can be solved by following these suggestions) which will certainly be fixed with an intervention on the NVIDIA driver front or of the game itself, but which do not affect a general feeling of downward scalability.", "date": "2017-06-05", "grade": "8.8"}
