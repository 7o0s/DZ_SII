In this review you will necessarily find some advances on the plot of Final Fantasy XV. Read at your own risk! With Episode Ignis ends the first year of DLC dedicated to Final Fantasy XV, which began with Episode Gladiolus last April, then continued with Episode Prompto and the multiplayer expansion Battlemates in the following months. It was a somewhat erratic operation that served both to offer new content to players who wanted to return to the world of Eos, and to resolve some outstanding problems in terms of gameplay and script. Not all donuts came with holes, however, and after a decidedly flaccid Episode Gladiolus followed first a very good additional content in the form of Episode Prompto, then a mediocre multiplayer mode that served more as a bridge between the original game and the feature film Kingsglaive which anticipated it in theaters. Episode Ignis, fortunately, raises the bar of quality with an interesting and surprising DLC. Assassin's Ignis We will never tire of repeating that we loved the dynamics of the four protagonists of Final Fantasy XV. We were the first to turn up our noses when Square Enix presented them to us but we were proved wrong by characters who were perhaps a little flashy, but well characterized and linked by credible and touching relationships. If we can consider Prompto Noctis's best friend, also because they are the same age, and Gladiolus his mentor, Ignis represents a figure halfway between a secretary and an older brother, as anyone who has seen the episode of the animated series Brotherhood dedicated to him knows. . Episode Ignis underlines the feelings of loyalty and trust that bind Ignis to his new king, catapulting us into the ninth chapter of the original game, when Noctis faces the Leviathan in Altissia, reducing the city to rubble. The DLC is divided into three short chapters which, played in a hurry, are exhausted within an hour, offering different styles of gameplay. In the first part of the adventure, we will control Ignis through the streets and roofs of Altissia. The city is not particularly large, but it is intricate and a special gadget will allow us to reach platforms and elevated positions to explore it far and wide. Our goal will be to reach a certain goal by defeating the imperials and their mechs that will block our way. As already happened in the previous DLCs, also in Episode Ignis we will have to practice with a slightly different combat system than that of Noctis and based mostly on the one implemented in the expansion Companions of battle: Ignis wields two very fast daggers and acting on the directional cross we will be able to choose between three different elemental properties. Fire daggers are best suited when dealing with a single target in close combat, while ice daggers are area-of-effect and are more effective against multiple targets. Finally, electric daggers are less precise but guarantee greater mobility. Repeatedly hitting enemies also loads an indicator that allows you to launch a more powerful attack than normal, while the right back button allows us to choose between two ~super moves~: one temporarily boosts Ignis' attacks, the other hits a target from above. The combat system works and it's a lot of fun, but honestly the differences between the daggers didn't seem very marked to us and we found ourselves facing enemies almost always holding the ice ones. Furthermore, the camera gave us quite a few problems, struggling to follow the action and getting wrapped up several times in awkward and confused positions. The best player of the match In the second chapter of the DLC, none other than Ravus Nox Fleuret joins Ignis, Lunafreya's brother who sided with the Empire and who wears a prosthesis in place of the lost arm in the film Kingsglaive (as, moreover, a very brief flashback reminds us). Ravus obviously isn't playable and helps Ignis a bit like Aranea in Prompto's DLC and Cor Leonis in Gladio's: at most we can use his special attack when the indicator allows it and hit enemies in combination by satisfying certain conditions. Ravus' company joins a very short stealth phase and culminates in a spectacular battle that serves to better characterize Luna's ambiguous brother, an enigmatic character who was only clarified after the game was released with the update that introduced the alternative path with Ignis and Gladiolus in the infamous Chapter 13 of Final Fantasy XV. All this preamble serves more than anything to introduce the comparison between Ignis and the Mephistophelean Ardyn, un villain who conquers the scene every time he makes his appearance and who also proved to be no less in this DLC. At this point, in the first game, chapter 3 ends with a predictable boss and with the long-awaited cinematic that reveals how Ignis lost his sight in the battle of Altissia, then the DLC ends and the story sadly resumes its way. However, once the DLC is completed, it is possible to replay chapter 3 immediately and literally follow an alternative path in which Ignis agrees to follow Ardyn: the subsequent sequences are rather bizarre, but they reveal - indeed, confirm - some important details about the past of the evil Chancellor and his plan to destroy Noctis and his legacy. This second version of Chapter 3 of Episode Ignis is essentially a succession of cinematics before and after a difficult boss fight, but the consequences of Ignis' decision are unsettling and lead to a real alternate ending for all of Final Fantasy XV. It's hard to judge Square Enix's choice. It is essentially a parallel reality, a courageous ploy that serves to give us some more information and possibly a conclusion that someone might even prefer to the original one, even if it is close to the level of fanfiction. In any case, it is an optional content that occupies a good part of the DLC, together with an extra boss and some goodies that can be unlocked in the actual game: at the proposed price of around 5 euros, Episode Ignis offers a pleasant excursus and , despite being a little shorter and less dense than Episode Prompto, it still proved to be entertaining and significant both in terms of narrative and content.", "date": "2017-12-16", "grade": null}
