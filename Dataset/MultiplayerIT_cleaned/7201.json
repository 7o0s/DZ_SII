{"name": "Overcrowded: Tycoon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/overcrowded-tycoon-recensione.html", "text": "We know that theme parks and amusement parks are perfect subjects for management games more or less since Bullfrog first had the happy idea of launching Theme Park, so we face this review of Overcrowded: Tycoon with all the positivity possible, enhanced by the undoubted advantage of a portable game. However, the inherent problems of the mobile essence of this title are already evident in the first minutes and tend to undermine the experience a bit, even if the game tries to at least counterbalance its greed with a certain generosity in terms of rewards. The result is not easy to frame, but it tends to be clear that it is a ~hypermobile~ title so to speak: its nature as a game for modern smartphones emerges clearly from the first minutes and, despite a structure that relies on practically eternal foundations, all the scaffolding of microtransactions, waiting and progression makes it difficult to digest for those looking for an old-fashioned management / strategy experience. The direct introduction into the action is appreciable: within the first few seconds of the game, with practically no prologue, we immediately find ourselves having to build our first attraction within an initially empty area. It starts with a small bumper car, but it is only the beginning of our empire of rides: soon we find ourselves having to manage a constant flow of public and try to direct them towards the greatest possible number of rides and various attractions, trying to maximize the satisfaction of the public obviously to increase earnings dramatically. Everything is set up to offer a constant progression towards an ever-increasing mass of customers and, of course, millionaire income. Unfortunately, the typical traps of this system also soon emerge, with forced waits, even rather long ones, which already appear after a few minutes of play and the unlocking of some elements which takes place only through payments, therefore it is a question of understanding how much one is willing to concede in these respects. Dream carousel Overcrowded: Tycoon, some screenshots The management of the park takes place in a very simplified but complete way, with a gameplay that adapts perfectly to mobile use: with quick touches on the screen, a free area of the park is selected, the attraction to be built is chosen and, subsequently, it is manages by selecting the various available parameters. It must be said that this is not a particularly deep control over the mechanisms of the playground, since all we can do, essentially, is just increase the scope of each single ride by increasing its capacity, price and obviously the attractiveness making it ever richer and more spectacular. In short, the general mechanism aims only at exponential growth, there is never a real strategic study on the economy and on the investments to be made, given that it is simply a question of spending profusely all that is earned to make the park always bigger and better. The idea of having to concentrate above all on managing large masses of public crowding around the attractions is nice and interesting (hence the particular choice of the title), but the solution to all problems seems to be simply waiting for enough funds and invest them in the next step virtually automatically. A Park of Overcrowded: Tycoon On the other hand, we must also consider that Overcrowded: Tycoon is something very different from the old Theme Park or Rollercoaster Tycoon, closer to a clicker game with idle elements, which pushes you to compulsively grow your creature and come back to it several times thanks to the boost provided by the rewards that continue to accumulate even if the game is kept in the background. It is clear that it is a product that looks to the brand new public of mobile titles more than to the old management and park builder enthusiasts, and if nothing else it must be said that it can be controlled in a truly perfect and comfortable way with the touch screen, even using only one hand, which stimulates use in any situation. This feature is supported by a clear and clean interface, fully manageable with a few taps on the screen and which allows you to keep tabs on a significant amount of things at a quick glance. Overcrowded: Tycoon, more screenshots from the game Speaking of microtransactions, it cannot be said that Overcrowded: Tycoon is devoid of predatory attitudes towards users. Every few minutes of the game, some pop-up signals to buy an exclusive attraction or watch videos to get bonuses, which we are now used to, except that here it becomesto a sort of integral part of the interface. The reference to in-app purchases is constant and, although these are not mandatory, they still represent an important part of the game given that some attractions can only be obtained with the purchase and the improvements require important expectations already at the beginning of the journey.", "date": "2022-06-16", "grade": "6.2"}
