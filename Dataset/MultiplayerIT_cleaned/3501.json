{"name": "Daemon x Machina", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/daemon-x-machina-recensione.html", "text": "In writing this review of Daemon x Machina for Switch we noticed at least two little objectionable features that make the Marvelous action a clearly Japanese product. One of these, of course, is the presence of robots, or Arsenals, huge mechs that season a planet devastated by a sci-fi apocalypse. The other, on the other hand, is more subtle, complex to collect and therefore as dangerous as it is fascinating: an enormously cryptic narrative, which anticipates a lot but explains less. In reality, continuing in the robotic adventure, the title, between lines and jokes of its characters, rattles off details that help to compose the puzzle, but there is a constant narrative parsimony that keeps one glued to the screen. Then, as one advances, flying from mission to mission, the more attentive remember a silent but significant element, which helps to understand who is behind this work: Tsukuda, the producer, was the father of Armored Core in the same offices in which a certain Hidetaka Miyazaki matured. Daemon x Machina fills a cosmic void with personality, one of those niche but heavy legacies left by the sacred monsters before him, connecting story and gameplay but at the same time separating them strongly in terms conceptual. The ambition of the First Studio offers an action product that is certainly much more complete than the expectations matured after its first reveal, capable of condensing the variegated souls of a culture of space mechs apparently the daughter of another era and yet still very strong today. Alone over there It is not easy to get into the plot and setting of Daemon x Machina: no matter how hard you try, you will need a lot of time to understand the Japanese approach to the story of the events of the past, the numerous factions of mercenaries at work and the even more substantial list of characters who will meet. The exclusive Switch is not a title with a complex structure, on the contrary: net of a small and scarcely explorable hub to act as a sort of interactive menu, progress is equivalent to jumping from one mission to another with a little bit of numbers and pieces to test, change or modify. Here, we have certainly summarized but the gist is this and it is a good thing that it is. Daemon x Machina is the quintessence of a fast, dynamic, varied mech game without great dead times, capable of skilfully mixing a rapid playful flow - some missions can last a handful of minutes - with a mechanism of growth and customization of the Arsenal certainly not too elegant in the interface, but certainly deep and well-finished. Perhaps a defect of the title is precisely the experience of using the mech's menus: despite a by now fairly good experience with the software, we still find it difficult to enter the dance of keys that leads to entering and exiting the various submenus, opening comparisons between stats, confidently list your latest weapons, or add or create an accessory. You pass the learning curve of using the mech in battle - not the easiest thing to digest, but it fits - but the menus could have been studied in a more elegant way. Once this small obstacle has been overcome, the experience gives excellent robotic satisfactions thanks to a effective loot mechanism of destroyed enemy arsenals and huge differentiation of weapons, body parts and mounts. In Daemon x Machina you will learn to experiment: having said that reading the characteristics requires time and awareness, the battlefield test of this or that laser cannon can determine whether or not to make you fall in love with its practical functioning, as well as the fit of light legs may thrill you with the faster movement speed compared to tougher but heavier limbs. It's just a matter of testing the new bodywork on the road and deciding if it's worth it, also based on the type of mission to be completed. Walking Advancing in the story, between mandatory and free quests, is fun and very captivating: Marvelous has been very good at inserting a large list of settings - inspired, not equally rich in distinctive elements but all artistically refined in the colors - and a good dose of objectives, ready to often give a hint of novelty to the current session. It may seem little, but it is not at all: Daemon x Machina leaves behind the banality of missions that are all the same or almost often included in similar titles, offering an exceptional mix of things to do and situations to face, translating the same into the playful dimension narrative stubbornness that leads to advance and want to find out what really happened to the planet and why humans, in the fight against artificial intelligences commanded by the Immortals, have taken refuge in the Oval Link. The ruolo of the Femto, in addition to being a lunar radiation, becomes a game element: the Arsenal has boosts, primary and secondary weapons, supports and processors, but it is the 3 consumption modes that determine the change of pace in the use of the mech. The controls respond well: we had fun running around in the sky and on the ground, rediscovering the beauty of the slide so dear to Vanquish and combining it with ideas from the team that led us to get out of the robot and advance on foot, perhaps in stealth missions , a bit like saying: fly, shoot and fight as much as you want, but still remain a human being. We appreciated Marvelous's approach to the bosses, huge but always set in that flow of patterns that are nice but temporally attributable to a few minutes, coloring a path dotted with unique and highly enjoyable situations with epic battles: running behind a train, saving towers from debris moons, find some remains of arsenal, fight other mercenaries, destroy cannons and so on. As far as mech games are concerned, First Studio has created a nice variety theater, giving dynamism to what can be, by its own fast nature, a portable or docked game. Sound goodies Daemon x Machina is a game that tends to be above average in terms of longevity, thanks to a story that continuously takes and pushes forward. The factions of the setting are many, as are numerous characters characterized by decorating a tree of relationships not explored but told through old-fashioned lines of dialogue. It is therefore not shocking that Marvelous, put on the plate of supporting actors - who can be enlisted in missions - has included an online and local multiplayer mode, so as to fully experience the group mech experience. Unfortunately, we have not had the opportunity to test this potential, but we have certainly tested it far and wide both in docked and undocked: the title is visually very valid, thanks to a good cel-shaded use of the Unreal Engine 4, capable of balancing a certain technical scarcity with a great artistic substance. The frames - we know you will ask us - sometimes go down in chaotic situations but everything remains perfectly playable, especially in portability where resolution and texture weight decrease. Only once, on a specific mission, did the framerate drop a lot, but we think that's more of a bug than anything else. Lastly, honorable mention goes to the soundtrack, custom-designed sci-fi by Junichi Nakatsuru, famous for having accompanied us with the Soul Calibur saga: the eclectic Japanese master has managed to give an incredibly enthralling musical imprint, combining expertly sung voices, jazz, metal and techno in a mix of other times, almost a Devil May Cry in a robotic room. Even if you never play Daemon x Machina, at least give it a listen.", "date": "2019-09-11", "grade": "8.0"}
