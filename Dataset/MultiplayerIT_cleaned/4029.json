{"name": "Dakar 18", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dakar-18-recensione-simulazione-arcade.html", "text": "Anglo-Portuguese developer Bigmoon has been working behind the scenes up to now, participating in the creation of 3D models for titles such as Jagged Alliance: Back in Action and FlatOut 4, and the PS4 port of Lichdom: Battlemage. In his curriculum, however, the collaborations with our Milestone for the WRC series stand out above all: an experience gained over several years that provided the basis for the first solo project, the ambitious (perhaps too much) Dakar 18. Dakar: after years a new title It is not surprising that videogames dedicated to such an extreme competition are nothing short of white: excluding a handful of them released at the end of the 1980s (when the fame of the Paris-Dakar was at its highest level) for the Amiga and Atari, the last attempts to set a game of driving in the Sahara desert are due to Acclaim with the catastrophic Dakar '97 and the best sequel Paris-Dakar Rally dated 2001. These were arcade-style titles released for consoles. After more than seventeen years things have changed radically and the Unreal Engine 4 used by Bigmoon allows a much deeper level of simulation. The title presents the official tracks and cars of the latest edition of the Dakar, which in 2018, starting from Lima (in Peru), and passing through La Paz (Bolivia), ended in Cordoba (in Argentina): basically 9,000 km which they covered much of the west coast of South America. Despite the historical name, it has been more than ten years since the Dakar started from Paris to finish in the capital of Senegal, where it stopped for the last time in 2007; the following year's edition was canceled due to terrorist threats in Mauritania and since 2009 the competition has moved permanently to the southern part of the New World. Even the crews and vehicles are official, albeit with some absences (for example, the Ford F-150 and the Iveco Powerstar are missing): there are therefore five categories that include cars, trucks, motorcycles, quads and SxS. More simulation than arcade Despite what one might be led to believe at a quick glance, Dakar 18 is much closer to a simulation than an arcade racing game. For the uninitiated, in fact, the tracks are ~imaginary~: unlike traditional rallies, it is not enough to start from point A and get to point B, since in between you have to pass through certain waypoints which can also include going back with respect to the direction that was going on. The short ~forced~ tutorial that anticipates even the initial screen makes things clear from the very first moments: after a few hundred meters on the dirt road the desert begins and, if you don't follow the co-pilot's instructions to the point, there is the certainty to end up in the middle of nowhere. So don't expect punctual assistance like that of DiRT Rally: here while driving you have to keep an eye on both the ~roadbook~ (the bible of the Dakar participants) at the bottom right and the compass at the top. They are both fundamental tools, with the notebook containing tables divided into three columns. The first shows the km from the starting point, the second presents a drawing of how the landscape you are traveling should look like and the third contains warnings about dangers (divided into three categories), such as the difference in height of a dune or the presence of stones in trajectory. Table bed is quite simple, but becomes very challenging while driving at high speeds, perhaps being careful not to destroy the car (or motorcycle). The compass is equally important and indicates how many degrees to turn the vehicle to enter the ~imaginary~ track. There is also a GPS which, however, is only activated near the waypoints, which you need to ~touch~ if you want to complete the stage successfully. Let's try to clarify things with a practical example. In the first stage, which required 8 attempts to complete, after the start we are told to follow the direction for 500 meters up to the dune; after which you have to turn left at 160 C for another 2 km continuing on the ridge; arrived at that point (morphologically indistinguishable from the previous ones), you have to make an imaginary 90 degree bend and follow the direction taken for another 5km. It goes without saying that it is enough to make a mistake in the angle of the steering by a few degrees to find yourself in a completely unknown point, without the co-driver being of the slightest help. You can then try to go back to a known area, which you may have already passed through (an abandoned hut, a fence) and try again to follow the indications in the roadbook more accurately. The assistance of the navigator is naturally less in those categories where the rider is left to its own devices, as with quads or motorcycles. Unconvincing driving model If all this is not enough for you, know that to raise the bar there are two other fundamental aspects to take into consideration. The first is obviously the state of health of the vehicle which, while not suffering aesthetic damage, can wear out all the more quickly the more violent the stresses to which it is subjected. Not all elements are repairable and in any case, fixing one of them involves penalties in terms of time, so it is necessary to pay close attention to the dangers noted in the roadbook. The other is the length of the stages, capable of putting even the most experienced player on the ropes. Although the game world is not in full scale, it is still extremely vast enough to require over 50 minutes to complete the second stage, which measures 230 km. If you consider that the longest reaches almost 1000 km you can get an idea of the concentration required even just to touch all the waypoints. The auto-save function still allows you to start over from the last intermediate goal reached, but with severe penalties in terms of time. The extreme realism of the navigation system (perhaps even exaggerated) clashes with a predominantly arcade-style driving model. Certainly it cannot be said that there is no difference between driving a motorcycle or a truck; however, the problem lies above all in a physics that we could at least define as ~creative~. This can be understood right from the tutorial, where it seems that the Toyota Hilux weighs 20 tons, it is so difficult to steer, or that the super Peugeot 3008 DKR (winner again this year) is as indomitable as a Formula 1. the bikes that seem to plant themselves on bumps or after jumps with a little too much simplicity. The competition in this sense is very fierce and the economic limits that the programmers have had to respect have not allowed them to reach the levels of the most important productions. A comparison that is also difficult to bear from a technical point of view: the vehicle models are very basic and the particle effects (such as sand and mud) that dirty the bodywork in a slightly too schematic way do not impress. An aspect that has tremendously annoyed us is that of the tracks left by the cars in front, which disappear before the player's eyes. If you manage to overlook certain ugliness (even the sky in low resolution is a punch in the stomach), graphics and sound do their duty and allow, on sufficiently powerful systems, to maintain a stable frame-rate even at higher resolutions ( we tested it successfully on the Asus PG348Q at 3440x1440 resolution with a GeForce 1080 without dropping below 60fps). There are four shots: a tiltable camera on the back of the vehicle, a cockpit view, a first-person view and a ~playful~ view from the helicopter that you will rarely use. Lots of bugs Unfortunately Dakar 18 is marred by a series of bugs and oversights that programmers are trying to fix by dint of patches (3 in five days from launch) that we cannot fail to report. The first and most serious concerns the lack of checkpoints which are sometimes physically absent: in order to load them, it is necessary to restart the title from the last save. Then there is the question of damages that remain even when the game is loaded from the previous point: the result is the risk of being halfway through the stage with a completely unusable vehicle and with the need to start the game over again. If we add to this aspect that the subsequent internships are available for exploration only having completed the previous ones, we are faced with a situation in which it will probably take weeks just to access the final test. Added to all this is very limited support for steering wheels: we used the Xbox 360 joypad without any problems, but the Steam forums are populated by users who don't see their device recognized. But the thing that infuriates the most are the errors of the co-driver who often provides completely bizarre and different indications compared to the roadbook, with the certainty of finding himself traveling kilometers into nothingness and having to restart from the previous check-point with all the penalties of the case. As mentioned, this bug disappears (of necessity) when using quads or motorcycles which, however, further raise the level of challenge. The multiplayer sector offers a wide range of possibilities (in addition to the classic internet network, split-screen and LAN are supported) and provides for a sort of head-to-head between the participants who all leave at the same time despite being able to select different meansbetween them. Our tests were disappointing because we never found more than three people populating the lobbies and, once we got in the car, we noticed a lot of stuttering.", "date": "2018-10-04", "grade": "5.5"}
