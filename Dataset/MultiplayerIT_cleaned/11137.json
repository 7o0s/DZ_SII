The tested version is the one for Nintendo DS. Today we make history The aim of the game is to make a civilization evolve up to the undisputed dominion over the others, to be reached by the set date of 2100 AD. through various paths, of your choice: ~domination~ is achieved through military supremacy, by defeating enemies; ~technological supremacy~ is achieved with scientific evolution and the conquest of space; ~Cultural supremacy~ is determined by building the most ~Great Wonders~ or housing a certain number of great characters (who appear periodically with the achievement of certain scientific and cultural objectives), while ~Economic supremacy~ requires the accumulation of 20,000 gold. The relationship with other civilizations doesn't necessarily have to be warlike, there are also various levels of diplomacy, although this version definitely ~presses~ towards armed confrontation. The action is marked by turns, each move takes a certain amount of time and, usually, a certain expenditure of money. You can choose the general setting of your work based on the objective to be pursued, but in any case it is necessary to manage resources in a balanced way and progress in each sector in order to be able to count on a strong civilization. At the beginning we choose the leader to interpret, and consequently the population that we will have to accompany to victory, each with its own characteristics. The game world is represented by a stylized map, on which units and cities appear, with movements and usable resources linked to the morphology of the terrain. The static elements, i.e. the urban settlements, generate wealth based on the resources present, and on the production setting: it is up to the player to decide which economic typology to base the city on (production of gold, science, food, etc.). The minute segmentation of productivity that allows, in the PC version, a practically total control of income and expenses, in favor of a general simplification, is missing here. Today we make history Each city can build, from time to time and within a certain number of turns, a unit, a building or a ~wonder~. The former are mostly military units, of different types and relative costs and utilities (infantry, cavalry, vehicles, for example); the buildings allow population increases or strategic enhancements of various types (increased productivity, raising culture and scientific research), while the great wonders represent the milestones of civilization on the road to cultural domination, bringing some bonuses to the characteristics of the population. The dynamic elements are the units, which carry out the strictly strategic component of the game: their main purpose is the discovery of the world and the conquest. Some are used to colonize and create new cities, but most of them are of a military nature, and allow direct clashes against other units or against opposing cities, through fights that are structured on the basis of the typical ~paper, stone~ style and scissor~, with strengths and weaknesses characteristic of each battalion, which make them more or less advantaged in clashes against other, specific units (although this first basic specialization must then be added with further values given by the experience in battle of the single team, which develops special skills). Obviously, these units undergo changes according to technological progress, transforming and increasing in power as the general evolution of civilization. Parallel to the live action, in the background we witness cultural and scientific evolution, which we can address by progressively deciding on which topics to concentrate research, which branches out through a tree-like development of knowledge, reflecting itself in technology and the cultural level of civilization. Also on the basis of this, new political arrangements arise from time to time which can be adopted at choice to change the government structure, with various consequences on the trend of the population. Checks The interface is optimally adapted to the Nintendo DS controls. Since the game has a rather staid rhythm (we are quite far from the excitement of an RTS), the use of the stylus is less intensive here, leaning towards a combined use of the directional cross, keys and touch screen. A certain learning period is required to master all the options on offer, but the rhythm marked by the turns tends to make the assimilation of the commands easier. You can't hear the butlack of mouse. The world is smaller The sector that has been most affected by the reduction of Sid Meier's classic into a cartridge is, undoubtedly, the graphic one. Made entirely in 2D, the game map closely resembles the early days of the series, with a rather confused rendering of the morphological elements and units present on the field, due to the stylization, the reduced screen size, and the smaller game world characteristic of this Revolution version. During the fights, there are short animated skits similar to those characteristic of Advance Wars, which illustrate the progress of the battle in a moment. There is a certain general anonymity that permeates the look of the game, which could perhaps have been done in 2D, but possibly with an extra touch of personality, to make it more enjoyable. However, it is a marginal element all in all, which in any case does not disturb the player's inclusion in the gears of the perfect game mechanics. The audio, on the other hand, stands at decent levels, without distinguishing itself in a particular way and contributing a bit to highlighting the slightly resigned technical aspect of the product. Note the presence of online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. A maximum of 4 players can take part in multiplayer games, which thanks to the turn-based structure are not affected by latency or connection problems. There are still a few players available on the square, but once you find them, the game runs pretty smoothly: the only note to make, if anything, concerns the impossibility of acting in any way during the other person's turn. At least the possibility of modifying those aspects of city management that do not influence the use of the game turn would have been desirable. Comment Firaxis's risky experiment must undoubtedly be promoted. Civilization Revolution manages to bring the complexity of Sid Meier's management to consoles, without having to sacrifice oneself on the altar of videogame mainstreaming: certainly becoming accessible, but without identity upheavals. On Nintendo DS, in particular, the feat was commendable: the heart of Civilization is all inside this cartridge, albeit in a reduced version technically and structurally pruned from the more complex offshoots of the PC version. In this portable context, the strong increase in the pace of play imposed by Revolution is also better justified, which by placing fierce enemies immediately outside the borders forces direct confrontation (most often of a military nature), and makes the games much shorter and more agitated compared to the thoughtful pace of the original. The only drawback of the production is represented by a certain anonymity in the technical realization, which could have compensated for the hardware limitations with a more characteristic style at least in the graphic system.Pro Deep and complex (almost) like the original Many different game solutions Online multiplayer present Cons Somewhat dull graphics Tends to be quite short Some icons and graphical representations are unclear The Civilization revolution is represented by the customs clearance of the strategic/management game par excellence in the ~frivolous~ world of consoles, actually quite mature by now to welcome even those titles that until now were the exclusive prerogative of PCs. Here then is that - as happened with Will Wright - Sid Meier's signature lands on the packaging of a game for Nintendo DS: something unthinkable until a few years ago. On the other hand, the Nintendo portable has already demonstrated its versatility for some time, and the ability to adapt in a particular way to RTS and management systems, managing, in those games conceptually linked to the use of the mouse, even to reproduce a more enjoyable gaming experience than the major consoles can, in defiance of computational superiority. With Civilization Revolution we are faced with a compromise, however: the version specially designed for consoles is in fact modified compared to the original PC title, with some pruning necessary to make it usable for the average user of gaming machines. With this, we don't want to say that Revolution is a vulgarization of Civilization: the effort made in trying to keep as many features as possible with respect to the original is commendable, but it was necessary to create a product that deviated from the sedimented and traditionalist structure of the PC series. A new beginning, therefore, a re-invention of Sid Meier's masterpiece for a new audience. The results are especially noticeable in the facetious graphic aspect (although in this version the game map closely resembles the first chapters of the original series), in the interfaceadapted to controllers (in this case to the joint use of the keys and the stylus) and in a decidedly increased pace of play. Truly remarkable - after the excellent result obtained by Firaxis in simplifying the original game structure in a new console version - the ability demonstrated in being able to then transfer everything inside a Nintendo DS cartridge, with losses practically only found in graphics and sound departments.", "date": "2008-10-13", "grade": null}
