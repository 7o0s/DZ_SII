{"name": "Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splinter-cell-chaos-theory.html", "text": "Theory and practice Right from the start, the effort by the developers to offer N-Gage users a gaming experience as similar as possible to that of the original product is evident in Chaos Theory: already evident from the design of the menus, the Splinter Cell style appears evident once you start a new game by going through the classic training course. Astonishment and perplexity alternate in the mind of the player who observes the graphic realization of the Gameloft title for the first time: the first caused by the goodness of the construction of the environments, by the quality of the polygonal model of Sam and his animations, the second caused by a frame rate evidently sacrificed on the altar of cosmetic impact. Definitely more beautiful when stationary than in motion, Chaos Theory still manages to survive the deficiencies of the graphics engine thanks to a gameplay capable of expressing its qualities even without a fluid scrolling of the image on the screen. Not expecting particularly sudden actions from the user, Chaos Theory lets itself be played without too many worries despite the low frame rate, even revealing itself in terms of pure entertainment as one of the best products available on N-Gage. This is because Gameloft has been able to transfer a large part of the playful peculiarities of the original titles to the Nokia laptop: we therefore find Sam Fisher's typical moves in their entirety (which can be carried out simply through a well-studied control system), as well as all the weapons and gadgets characteristic of the series, obviously without neglecting the actual game mechanics. Even on N-Gage, therefore, the user finds himself busy having to go through the various levels hiding in the shadows, eliminating the guards silently in order to achieve his objectives. What is certain is that, however well-finished, such a porting can hardly be able to achieve the structural complexity of its inspirer. And in fact, Chaos Theory is not slow to show some limits. Fisherman in troubled waters Already floundering in an attempt to create a sufficiently detailed three-dimensional world, the Chaos Theory graphics engine obviously fails to offer a convincing lighting system, slightly distorting the leitmotif of the series, precisely made up of the juxtapositions of areas of light and shadow. In addition to this, the game turns out to be quite simple and therefore prone to a certain basic flatness: the artificial intelligence of the guards is in fact decidedly poor, allowing the user to continue with relative fluency, and the objectives of the missions appear very little processed. To forget, then, the naive implementation of the night vision goggles and the heat research one: by activating the first, the image becomes so grainy as to make it unusable, while the second provides a vision that is too dim and blurred, unsuitable for identifying laser beams and so on. similar. In short, Chaos Theory is in some ways the victim of an excessive spirit of emulation, presenting some choices that perhaps should have been better considered in the light of the technical limitations of the Nokia console. Nonetheless, as previously mentioned, the Gameloft title is still a solid, engaging and well-crafted stealth game, also capable of exploiting the Bluetooth potential of N-Gage with two courageous and interesting multiplayer modes (Co-Operative for two players and Versus for up to four users). The N-Gage Arena function also finds space in the Gameloft product, in this case offering the possibility of entering scores in online scoreboards. The roundup closes the sound sector of Chaos Theory, consisting of music and effects in full Splinter Cell style that accompany the course of the game with precision, in stark contrast to other extremely silent N-Gage productions. Comment Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is a good game, which unlike other 3D ported titles has managed to keep strong points of contact with the source product by implementing them judiciously enough to match the N-Gage's features. While proving to be pretentious in some aspects and decidedly naive in others, Chaos Theory still remains an absolutely advisable title for all owners of the Nokia handheld, also thanks to a convincing technical realization and a multiplayer mode via Bluetooth of sure interest. Pros: Good technical realization Engaging gameplay Faithful to the original version Cons: Low frame rate Low level of challenge Some poorly maintained aspects After a 2D episode (however not unforgettable), the Splinter Cell series continues to advance on N-Gage hand in hand with the original incarnation for home consoles, this time however with abig news: developed by Gameloft, this Chaos Theory for the Nokia handheld is presented in a completely three-dimensional guise, thus tracing the visual and playful aspects of its older brother much more closely. A successful experiment or a new specious ~impossible~ porting attempt? Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is probably both", "date": "2005-03-17", "grade": null}
