XRX as can be easily understood from the close nominal similarity with its predecessor, has not implemented a revolution but has moved on the same coordinates as its ancestor, trying to expand those features that have decreed its moderate success. Thus confirmed the possibility of choosing an arcade or simulation setting, whose substantial differences concern the control system, the former more benevolent, the latter much less friendly, especially when our 4-wheeler has suffered some structural damage. Just the damage system is one of the main dishes confirmed: undoubtedly well made even if perhaps in some cases, the software tends to excessively magnify the shocks. The ~driver's health~ parameter is also present again, so much so that after too many blows taken by our digital alter ego, it will even be possible to withdraw from the competition. extreme mud... The first disappointment that Xpand Rally Xtreme gives us concerns (even in this, however, it is a confirmation...) the total lack of licenses for the cars present with cars very similar (even in the names) to those participating in international competitions but reminiscent of those ~tarots~ typical of video game productions of the 80s. The Techland programmers state that the choice is due to the intention of having free hands with regard to the damages but the enthusiast of motorized competitions will undoubtedly experience a bitter taste in the mouth. To restore happiness to the gamer, there will be a good roster of racing cars present (15 to be exact, some present in different versions) divided into various power classes, all ~customizable~ with a good tuning component both in terms of performance than in the aesthetic one (although the latter is limited to the colors and motifs of the bodywork). the first disappointment that Xpand Rally Xtreme gives us concerns the total lack of licenses for the cars present Rallying and more... Xpand Rally Xtreme offers the typical options of a racing game: career, single races and multiplayer component sufficiently developed to spend a few hours online in the company of other virtual rally drivers. There are 5 scenarios (China, Malaysia, Italy, Japan and the USA) for a total of 67 races: the level design of the tracks is decidedly pleasant with a good variety of ups and downs, various bumps and some sufficiently spectacular jumps. However, we must also note a certain ~flatness~ which will tend to make the experiences on the road excessively similar. Fortunately, to the rescue of the variety come some not typically rallying tests such as the ~Motor Show~ style duels on two-lane tracks and blatantly arcade competitions where we will have to reach various checkpoints on the map in an absolutely free way and free from any rules, without forgetting to do brawling with opponents. Things seen, reviewed and overseen in other titles but which offer a non-monotonous experience as always (or almost) always happens in rally games. Old Gen engine From a purely technological point of view, it is certainly not titles like Xpand Rally Xtreme that demonstrate the non-inferiority of a medium-high-end PC compared to the new generation consoles. In fact, the Techland title remains anchored to the graphics engine of its prequel, optimizing exclusively what was proposed a few years ago. We are not commenting on a poor product but absolutely ~old-gen~ in all respects, characterized by a slight pop-up that does not want to disappear even by setting the graphic parameters and video resolution to the minimum wage. That said, at the same time XRX has no particular structural defects since the frame rate remains constant, clearly with an adequate setting and contextualized to your configuration, in every game situation and there are even some pleasant light effects that make a fine show convincingly on the car bodies. The spectators who run on the circuit before our racing car reaches their height are a small cameo that is however pleasant and which raises the rate of spectacularization of our playful experience by a little. after the unreachable Gran Turismo, the Techland production offers one of the best systems for reproducing its performances Old Gen engine On the other hand, the replay of XRX is of a very different level: according to who is writing to you, after the unattainable Gran Turismo, the production of Techland offers one of the best systems for reproducing its performances with lots of possibilities for export files in .avi format and show them to friends to whom you can freely add comments from ganassa. The many cameras available are truly valuable as well as the various video filters that can be controlled with an interface of unique simplicity and immediacy and also the musical accompaniment (present only in the replay ... a classic for rally games ...) adrenaline pump adequately. The replay is undoubtedly the highlight of Xpand Rally Xtreme which also has the advantage of having been marketed in Italy at the budget price of 29.90.

An undoubtedly pleasant title, complete with the possibility of choosing between an arcade and simulation setting, a good dose of options, game modes and tuning but which remains too anchored, from a technological and playful point of view, to its predecessor also in terms of total absence of official licenses. One of the best replays in a racing game and a budget price on the first release are undoubtedly the most positive aspects to be highlighted for this Made in Poland title. Pro Replay splendid Price Budget Game modes and options above average for a rally Cons Old-gen technical realization Monotony in level design Absence of official licenses Trending and non-trending More or less inexplicably, in the world of videogames (but not only...) from time to time as trends are created, at the same time real voids are created within a particular type of videogame production. Let's take the titles dedicated to rallying for example: towards the beginning of the new century between Colin McRae, Richard Burns and other ~mud-dirtied~ racing drivers, for the video driver there was only the embarrassment of choice both on PC and on consoles. In the last two years, on the other hand, an almost total blackout has been created which Xpand Rally Xtreme finally manages to remedy by the Polish programmers of Techland and sequel to their previous Xpand Rally.", "date": "2007-02-23", "grade": null}
