The refinement of the first, still embryonic Street Fighter in its sequel produced a real cyclone, corresponding to the creation of a new production paradigm, the affirmation of a genre and a new synergy between the arcade and home entertainment sectors. On SuperNES, Nintendo's sixteen-bit flagship novel, the initial Street Fighter 2 exclusive (shortly followed by Turbographx and Megadrive conversions) marked a massive lead in Nintendo's favor. The conversion of Street Fighter 2 was almost identical - finishing and overall impact aside - to the arcade counterpart. But Capcom had managed to create a goose that lays golden eggs and, entirely predictably, Street Fighter 2 spawned a series of pseudo-sequels, versions and, consequently, improved and enriched home conversions so long, and such a large number of spin-offs and variations, that the Super NES port became obsolete within a year. Street Fighter 2 Turbo, first in arcades and then again on Super NES, is precisely the first of the ~upgrades~ of Capcom's revolutionary fighting game, the first and decisive work of enrichment of the gaming experience. Offering the possibility of playing with the four bosses that were previously inaccessible to the player, making it possible to vary the game speed as desired by choosing between one and four stars (hence the name Turbo), refining the already excellent combination of shots and the control system , making the characterization in the menus more aggressive and enriching the already graceful aesthetic sector, Street Fighter 2 Turbo replaced its now aged predecessor in all respects. What is it today Street Fighter 2 Turbo is, in itself, one of the best editions ever produced of a revolutionary and historic title at the same time, capable of redefining the paradigm of an entire genre by offering a battlefield that is as simple as it is elegant, as immediate as it is full of strategic potential, a shortlist of characters and settings that have entered the collective memory of the players and a control system that has often undergone variations but is still preferred by many fans of the genre. In this sense, Street Fighter 2 Turbo remains one of the most important titles of the sixteen-bit era, one of the best fighting games in history and a title to be absolutely replayed, in arcade version or conversion, fifteen years after its original appearance , taking advantage of its presence in the Wii digital catalog to rediscover or recover it. However, it is significant that the same, identical logic of the upgrade that forced an excellent game like Street Fighter 2 to populate the second-hand market fifteen years ago determines today, in the same way, the loss of playful and commercial attractiveness of the first edition of Street Fighter , also in the catalog for months. What is it today Street Fighter 2: Turbo has supplanted Street Fighter 2 on the same console in less than a year just as it supplants it today on the Wii catalog, with the difference that there is no second-hand market for points. But there's more, a sword of Damocles probably already silently erected and which is called Super Street Fighter 2, that is to say the third edition of the fighting game for the cinemas, immediately afterwards also converted for SuperNES. The story is identical: Super Street Fighter 2 (which ran on new hardware, unlike the Turbo which used the same card as its predecessor) in turn supplanted the previous version by offering four completely new characters, new special shots, a refined combat system , graphic improvements to various levels and, in a nutshell, the new state of the art of the series (and, if we want to be honest, in the arcade Super Street Fighter 2 was itself made obsolete by Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, which added to the formula a new boss and a bar for lethal special shots; even the hype for the future Street Fighter 3 died out well before the third ~official~ title, now forgotten, timidly arrived years later on an already transformed market again) . Street Fighter 2 Turbo will therefore also be an excellent, immortal, universally advisable title, intact even in the interface on Wii thanks to the in-game customization of the buttons on the controller (if it was for Nintendo, of course, which does not allow you to customize the buttons of the Classic Controller and claims to always offer the configurations ~as is~, we would stay fresh). But on the market they are available like thisThere are so many sequels, online or offline versions and collections that its appeal risks diminishing due to competition from more recent titles. And its belonging to a series with such a consumerist arcade logic, for which the new version replaces the previous one, risks annoying paying users who, in a few more months, will have to shell out more Wii points if they want to get their hands on not only with Balrog and Vega but also with Fei Long and Cammy, or if they will finally want to choose between Ryu and Ken as two fighters with a completely distinct style at last. Fifteen years later, the Turbo version of Street Fighter 2 returns to Wii, the second SuperNES incarnation of Capcom's multimillion-dollar series that changed the history of video games. But in a decade and a half and the new and numerous evolutions of the Capcom-style two-dimensional fighting game, collections and live arcade included, will this conversion still be worth it?", "date": "2007-08-13", "grade": null}
