{"name": "Queen: Rock Tour", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/queen-rock-tour-recensione.html", "text": "Rhythm games are a genre that perhaps does not lend itself very well to touch devices, and which certainly boasted its own well-defined dimension on consoles, with guitar-shaped controllers that required a certain type of coordination and which, over the years, have come very close to the actual practice of playing an instrument. We therefore approached the review of Queen: Rock Tour with a hint of skepticism, while being reasonably enthusiastic that Gameloft wanted to dedicate its latest mobile game to the legendary English band and to his long live career, which with its tours has embraced every part of the world for about fifteen years. Structure Queen: Rock Tour, the main screen from which to access content and modes. Let's start with the structure of what appears to all intents and purposes as a premium title: it is possible to download Queen: Rock Tour for free from the App Store or Google Play and try the first stages, but to unlock the full game you need to make an in-app purchase from 3.49 euros (2.99 on Android). An excellent approach, we often say, but the rules of the mobile market are what they are, free is the norm and it seems that even Apple is struggling to break this preconception with its subscription service. However, we were talking about the structure, characterized by a campaign that resumes ten tours of the band, from 1974 to 1986, offering us about twenty songs among the most famous of the group: there are obviously the various ~We Will Rock You~, ~Bohemian Rhapsody~, ~Radio GaGa~, ~We Are the Champions~ and ~Another One Bites the Dust~, but also the songs from the first albums, less known to the masses. Queen: Rock Tour includes many materials and curiosities about the English band. The path packaged by the developers takes the traditional ~rewards~ approach, asking us to complete the stages with a certain degree of success and to collect a minimum number of discs before being able to access the next stages. The most difficult versions of the same songs are also unlocked, which add further melodic tracks to the basic ones: all in the norm. In the side dish we also find very nice things and of great value for Queen fans, as well as for those who finally want to deepen their knowledge of their career. In fact, it is possible to access unpublished materials, photos, curiosities and an editor where you can buy new outfits and clothes for the four members of the group: Freddy Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon. Gameplay Queen: Rock Tour, an image of the action stage with its various tracks. So let's come to the gameplay and the perplexities we were talking about at the beginning. The point is this: touching the rhythmic elements on the screen of a smartphone or tablet is inevitably easier than coordinating eyes and hands on a controller, which is why even at the highest difficulties the challenge proposed by Queen: Rock Tour is far from what one might imagine. The developers have done everything possible to add variety to the dynamics, increasing the tracks and introducing multiple swipes, asynchronous touches and trying to make the vocal, guitar, bass tracks as convincing as possible and drums, but as mentioned even novices with minimal pace and familiarity with the tracklist will be able to complete the challenges without great difficulty. Technical realization The great protagonist of the technical sector of Queen: Rock Tour is obviously the soundtrack, which as mentioned draws on over ten years of touring by the English band, thrilling us once again on the notes of pieces such as ~Somebody to Love~ and ~Under Pressure ~. The rendering of errors and wrong touches is also beautiful, which only interrupt the track concerned until we get back on track. As for the graphics, however, we enter the field of personal tastes and sensitivities: it was understandably chosen to portray the members of the group in a nice but not irresistible ~chibi~ version, with discrete but essential animations, just as the scenography is essential. On the other hand, the trailers that introduce each tour are very beautiful, with customized graphics that skilfully mix original and unpublished materials.", "date": "2021-03-08", "grade": "8.0"}
