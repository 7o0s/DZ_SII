During the campaign we follow the story of three races who are engaged in the conquest of Neverdaar and the primary objective in order to finally triumph is to upgrade the generals and their units that can accommodate up to 12 fighters; to do this you need money, experience points and a lot of time to spend. One of the key elements is obviously constituted by the captain of the unit who can increase his leadership and in doing so can command more and more high-level fighters. Among the available classes we find thieves, knights, wizards and healers as in the best fantasy tradition and obviously the fighters can be used as support, as a source of direct damage or as a tank, or the type intended for the subtle art of surviving beatings. There are also special units, like titans and dragons, that are nice to look at while they're in our ranks. In fact, even if the title tries to maintain an acceptable learning curve, it happens to suddenly encounter very powerful units that can wipe us out if we haven't bought the right spells or we have forgotten to unlock the class advancement for our tank . Each class can then choose two different specialization branches but once a path has been chosen all units of that type will be trained following that type of specialization. The art of war In any case, engaging in combat healthy, well equipped and with good possibilities for treatment usually allows you to take home the skin all too easily. But to be prepared it is necessary to carefully dose the sources of power scattered throughout the territory that regenerate and guarantee rather powerful bonuses. It is also important to remember the potions bought in shops around the world or found while exploring, but above all it is vital to better manage the resources guaranteed by the capital. In fact, within the latter we can build different types of structures that allow us to research spells, train or improve the training of units and heal and resurrect our soldiers. As for the rest, all that matters now belongs to the classic dictates of turn-based combat. The choice of the primary target and the protection of units that strike from a distance or can heal are the factors that decide our fate on the field. In addition to leveling up of course. Furthermore, the battlefields can randomly offer small hills or positions capable of increasing the magical attack, at a distance or in close combat. Obviously it is advisable to occupy these positions before the enemy units do since in the end it is the only tactical element of the entire combat system, with the obstacles present on the field and the bodies of soldiers or creatures that offer no shelter . If an enemy decides to shoot down our magician, for example, the only way to save the caster is to instantly disintegrate whoever is targeting him, without further tactical possibilities. But that's not the only negative note. In fact there is no way to support the units in the neighboring quadrants and this element truncates the strategic complexity of the title. Furthermore, the options menu lacks fundamental possibilities such as the calibration in the scrolling speed of the mouse, really pachydermic, or the mapping of the keys. The importance of balancing A striking example of the poor balance of the title, despite the intense work of the .dat guys, is certainly made up of the guardians of the faith and the defensive units in general. By exploring and conquering the Disciples III map it is in fact possible to activate defensive structures which are powerful magical creatures that guard the territory we have conquered. On paper, a potentially interesting strategic element. Now let's take as an example the guardians of faith who can level up and have a very powerful area effect attack. Being statues, however, they have a problem, in fact they cannot move from the initial location and to control the pitch they have to rely on some summons. But what's the use of giving these units a flaw like immobility and the ability to summon creatures if the faith guardian's attack covers the entire playfield and does more damage than any summonable creature? Furthermore, every time an enemy attacks one of these units we are transported to the turn-based battlefield to face these fights, often completely meaningless. Sure you can always fix automatsthe clash, and this is precisely one of the cases in which it is convenient, but we are still distracted, slowed down and uselessly engaged by an event that often does not offer even a pinch of challenge or strategy. Wandering around Neverdaar The world design is diverse and detailed with different climate zones and warm, immersive colors. The map is vast, in three dimensions and includes long explorations that initially give some emotions. The playing field is in fact not exactly a strategic map but a real territory to explore. But this choice turns into a boomerang when coupled with the turn-based movement, which often makes the longer journeys of real ordeals capable of breaking the legs of even the most patient player. If nothing else, the map is full of buildings, trees, lights, lava, prairies, towns, castles and the panorama is undoubtedly pleasant and immersive. On the contrary, the combat screens are poor in details, the colors are cold and some models, despite being sufficiently defined, are often aseptic and plasticky. Furthermore, the animations, although valid and fluid, are very few and when there are several units of the same type, the feeling of being in a fictitious and uninvolving environment is strong and unpleasant. The light effects are good while the spells are erratic: some stylized, a la Warcraft, are even pleasant but others recall the first experiments with three-dimensional graphics. Something that dates back to the 90s and that we would have preferred to leave in that era. The architectural quality of the buildings is almost nil and among other things the structures are visible only within the management menu while on the game map we see only anonymous stylized fortresses. At least there is no shortage of side elements, such as the narration of the events related to the act in which we are playing on the loading screen and the ambient audio is well done and helps to support the excellent atmosphere that surrounds the strategic game map . All smooth from a technical point of view with peaks of 400 frames per second which underline the lightness of the game engine.", "date": "2010-08-11", "grade": "5.5"}
