{"name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-2.html", "text": "My name is Recon, Ghost Recon! For those unfamiliar with the PC version here is a brief summary of the facts. As explained by the persuasive voice of the initial intro (among other things completely redone in CG for the occasion, where the ~old~ woman limited herself to using the game engine), we are in 2008 and a group of terrorists who evidently did not better things to do decides it's time to revive the old Soviet Empire. To thwart the threat, the US brings their best men into action, the D team, called ~Ghost~ due to the extraordinary infiltration skills of the team members. The initial menu is very rich and includes the usual training section in which to practice with the controller. Fortunately, the lack of the mouse is not felt, thanks to a complex but ingenious placement of the keys, all the commands of the PC version have been re-proposed in this conversion. This is followed by a mode called Tactical Exercises, the Campaign option, the real core of the game, and a section called Special Elements full of documents and movies. To close the ever-present multiplayer mode. By tackling the main mode you will have three difficulty levels available. It is better to clarify from the beginning that even the simplest level, the Recruit one, will not be a walk in the park at all. Depending on the difficulty selected, not only will the enemies be more difficult to deal with but you will be denied information useful for the location of dangers and you will be removed from automatic aiming. Mission planning has been replaced with a simple briefing, perhaps so as not to make managing your men in battle too complicated. In this regard, those who should have at least glimpsed the PC version will notice that the men available, 6 for each mission, are divided into two teams of three instead of three teams of two with the consequent relocation of the characters, a choice perhaps dictated by willingness to make it easier to control and dislocate your during the battle. The group is divided according to 4 skills: sniper, rifleman, demolisher and support. Each soldier can be assigned an armament and skills that will grow as you progress in the game, provided, however, that you manage to keep them alive. If, in case one of your soldiers were to die in battle, he would be replaced by another fellow soldier with less experience. Once this is done, you can finally get into the game. In action! As mentioned earlier your men are divided into two teams, Bravo and Alpha. Through a map, it will be possible to make each team move in a specific area. The orders to be given are divided into three categories: hold, advance and advance at any cost. However, these commands are not mandatory; if by any chance your platoon is under attack, the soldiers will decide to stop or flee in defiance of your orders, a factor which, while on the one hand gives greater credibility, sometimes tends to block yours for too long in one place when instead they would be more useful by your side. The AI of the soldiers is very good even if it would have required some filings, which happened in the PC version through the use of some patches, in fact it does not infrequently happen that the teams suddenly stop in front of a door or an apparently trivial obstacle. defect which however does not affect the good that has been done in general. As for the enemies, however, something must have gone wrong during the conversion phase. It sometimes happens that they make themselves the protagonists of egregious oversights or that they are able to see through walls making your stealth action useless, and they often find themselves pointing in your direction as if they knew which way you were coming. This can be annoying when you need a specific item in one of the mission objectives. If you send him forward and even with all the possible cover this is taken out you will have to repeat the mission from the beginning, this is because it is not possible to take weapons and objects from either your own fallen or from killed enemies. The transportable armament is quite sparing, even if the number of weapons available is considerable. Although the arsenal corresponds in all respects to the real counterparts, the lack of a basic function such as the choice between the burst and the single shot seems somewhat strange, moreover in a game that aims to be a realistic simulation. Overall, there is a slight simplification of the entire game system due to some choices made by the programmers who probably intended to meet console users. Infirst of all, a radar has been added that signals the exact position of the enemies, which can be criticized taking into account that the game offers us to act with circumspection in every situation. Each attack is therefore less studied, however the simple break-in without thinking about the consequences will still be fatal. Furthermore, it is not possible to command a single man on the map, he can only be moved while on the battlefield even if the distance covered will be lower. Give Clancy what is Clancy's Having said this, it might seem that the defects in the title could affect the quality of the product. But no. The new elements introduced in the console version and the aforementioned flaws do not change the value of an overall good game. Put simply, Ghost Recon for PS2 is, and remains, the ~Ghost Recon~ that PC users know. Each mission will have to be carefully studied in every detail. Advancing troops without any logic not only will not get you anywhere but will also be harmful due to the aforementioned replacement of a fallen soldier with a new inexperienced soldier. You will repeat the missions several times before you manage to save your skin without having any losses in your ranks. You will get angry when you fail a mission for a single uncalculated detail, but at the same time you will be encouraged to study a new, even more perfect strategy. You will feel regret when one of your people who has always faithfully accompanied you on several missions will have been killed and immediately replaced by a new recruit. This and more make GR the game that has enthralled a myriad of users yes, those users who battle each other on the Internet in furious battles still today. The only real problem with GR for PS2 is the lack of multiplayer mode. Sony's much-vaunted online policy hasn't given the desired results, there are few games today that can boast an online mode and unfortunately Ghost Recon is not among them. Alternatively, a LAN network could have been created, but evidently it was judged by the coders to be hardly feasible (true TimeSplitters 2?). So we just have to settle for the two-player mode, nice yes, but not comparable to a battle between 16 players as is the case for the XBOX version. Technical realization As often happens in conversions between PC and console, the graphics sector is always the least cared for element. The game in its PC version is a year old and in the world of video games this period of time is felt a lot. The graphics engine doesn't show excessive flaws, the models are well cared for and the textures don't suffer from an excessive washout, however on PS2 it's legitimate to expect better, an increase in polygons would have been desirable especially for the conformation of the terrain which seems to have undergone a embarrassing overall drop compared to its PC counterpart. From its side, the PS2 version can boast of additional details including a better rendering of flames and smoke implemented through particles, and better management of the wind which makes the leaves and bodies of water sway in a quite realistic way. On the other hand, there is no doubt about the sound system, one of the best I've ever heard in recent years. The sound effects are well done, weapons and explosions are quite convincing, the vocals are well dubbed even if the number of spoken sentences is not very high. In my opinion, the soundtrack is out of comparison, excellently made and capable of involving the player in every moment of the mission. Keep the volume at maximum and you will be immersed in an incredible atmosphere! Comment Ghost Recon nonetheless remains the ~Ghost Recon~ that PC users have loved. Unfortunately, the lack of a multi-player multiplayer option is felt but it would be unfair to weigh it excessively when there is a single player mode that can be played willingly. Of course, overall if a comparison were to be made between the PC version and the Playstation 2 version, the former would still come out a winner considering the many doubts that the latter brought to light during the review phase, but it would be a useless comparison because if you are reading these rows means that you don't have a PC equipped for gaming. If, on the other hand, you were in possession of a nice PC well, you know which version to choose. PROS: +Successful mix of action and strategy +Perfect soundtrack +It will make you suffer for a long time +It's Ghost Recon! CONS: -No online team multiplayer option- Additions in the console version not very convincing - Graphically quite outdated - Slightly simplified compared to the PC version Strange story that of RedStorm Entertainment. Founded several years ago by Tom Clancy, world-famous political fiction thriller writer, RedStorm began its ~career~ with Politika, a disappointing title characterized by poor gameplay but with a background of sure impact. In 1998 Rainbow Six was released, an exciting thriller that soon became a best seller in bookstores, and given the close link between the author and the software house, a game inspired by it was created. In most cases, games based on films or books have the defect of being developed with the least possible effort by re-adapting already tested concepts. RS itself, if it had been developed with this criterion, could have turned into a Quake-like FPS but less frenetic. Evidently a divine inspiration must have come to the programmers if the final result of their labors was nothing less than one of the best stealth games in the history of video games. Since that day, water has passed under the bridge, as have its sequels and expansions. In 2002 Ghost Recon was released for PC, the outdoor Rainbow Six with a military setting that immediately met with enormous success with audiences and critics. After a year Ghost Recon is available for consoles, the elapsed time is felt above all in the graphics, but on closer inspection some other elements have also been lost along the way.", "date": "2003-03-21", "grade": null}
