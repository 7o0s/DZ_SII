The quantity and quality of products offered is so high that, over time, there is a risk of saturating the genre, ending up re-proposing ideas that are not very original, perhaps ~refreshed~ with just a few variations, for the sole purpose of not justifying a possible accusation of plagiarism. It is therefore up to the developers to rack their brains to try to find that gameplay solution that makes one title preferable over another, helping themselves more than with the technique with their vivid imagination. And whoever conceived the bizarre Blast-A-Way universe of imagination, we are sure, could have plenty to sell. Hunting for boxes The funny world of Blast-A-Way is divided into 5 macro-levels each made up of common materials: wood for the first world, metal for the second, fabric for the third, stone and plastic for the last two. During a typical game afternoon, a large group of ~little boxes~, a term equivalent to our ~children~ but which in this case indicates real anthropomorphic little black boxes, decides to climb the forbidden Sticky Bomb Monument. The tower, very wobbly, suddenly yields and the detonation of the bombs contained inside distributes the poor little boxes in all 5 levels previously listed. Using 3 nice colored robots, you will have to recover all the boxes stuck in the different blocks (3 for each stage) safely and bring them to the ~rescue spring~, a small but effective escape route. The robot control system is very simple, in fact it is enough to indicate with your finger the path you want it to take; the trajectories can be traced on the screen in a safe way since the little automatons cannot under any circumstances fall from the platforms and blocks they are on. Touching instead the white space outside the playing area rotates the view (leaving everything else stationary) while a slide on the action area simply moves the camera while keeping the angle fixed. Magnification is finally managed with the classic two-finger pitch-to-zoom. The only way to save the boxes is to run past them with the robots; the problem is that many of these little pests find themselves stuck, due to the explosion, inside the colored blocks of which the various levels are made up. To free them, therefore, it is necessary to apply the old maxim of the ~nail drives out the nail~, i.e. detonate the robots with other bombs near the blocks, thus shattering them. To arm a robot it is necessary to hover over the chosen type of bomb (or the one available if there is only one), while to adjust the launch just hold down the chosen target and fix the desired angle by removing your finger at the right time . However, each bomb has different properties, dictated by numerous factors, the first of which (and most fundamental) is that of color: in fact, a bomb is capable of destroying blocks of its own color while it will be ineffective against the others. The bombs can then be impact, a type that guarantees instantaneous detonation at the moment of touch with the exact surface, or sticky, or capable of sticking to the designated blocks and exploding after a few seconds. But there are other ammunition and decidedly more atypical environmental details, such as teleporters, ideal because they allow you to move from one platform to another instantly, sponge bombs, which first bouncing off a surface acquire its color and then explode at the second touch, the repair ones, which rebuild previously destroyed portions of the level, the ~gates~ which change the color of the explosives if they are crossed, ramps, barriers and so on for a really wide choice of approach to the levels. In Blast-A-Way you must essentially know how to destroy the obstacles placed between the boxes and the escape route in the right order, using the bombs wisely and avoiding that the detonations, if carried out clumsily, can cause you to fall out of the area game the unfortunate little protagonists by killing them instantly. On a technical level, the game is practically perfect both on the iPhone and, above all, on the iPad where it gives its best also for a matter of comfort, thanks to the extreme cleanliness and the bright and pleasant colours.", "date": "2012-10-04", "grade": "9.0"}
