{"name": "Angry Birds Journey", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/angry-birds-journey-recensione.html", "text": "Angry Birds was a stratospheric success, one of the biggest ever in the mobile arena: the game developed by Rovio has turned into a real cult phenomenon within a few months and its popularity has been relaunched by each subsequent game , while leaving the original formula intact, still irresistible today. The Finnish team has tried for years to find an equally valid idea, but without succeeding. Back from several more or less interesting spin-offs, he finally understood that the key lay in reinterpreting those mechanics, refining them and enriching them with an avalanche of new ideas, thus obtaining an equal but different experience, capable of regaining the favor of nostalgics but also to involve a completely new user. Goal achieved? We reveal it to you in the Angry Birds Journey review. Gameplay Angry Birds Journey, the mysterious chests can become anything but we will have to hit them to find out The wicked green pigs have stolen the precious eggs of the Angry Birds and so the latter have launched themselves in pursuit: the narrative incipit of the new chapter is nothing more than a simple expedient to stage the classic fight between good guys and bad guys, which this time however it is consumed in the context of a particularly rich and multifaceted structure. The basics of the gameplay have not changed that much: within each stage we will have to launch our birds against the structures built by the pigs in order to eliminate them and at the same time save the puppies, often and willingly trapped, whether in cages, balloons, ice prisons or more: situations that each require a different solution. Angry Birds Journey, one of the special shots turns structures into brittle ice The ever-present slingshot can now be modulated so that the launch follows different trajectories, but it is the unique abilities of the birds that change the cards on the table and give the experience a strategic depth. Chuck, Bomb, Matilda, Stella and Red boast not only a different appearance from what we are used to, but also modified powers, which change the way we have always played Angry Birds. First of all Chuck is the first character available, but not accelerates on launch but spins on impact. In general all birds perform their characteristic maneuver as soon as they hit the target and from this point of view Red has been characterized better than usual, with a crazy and insane attack that gives a good idea of his proverbial rage. Beyond the individual powers, which can be amplified when the relative indicator fills up, however, it is the variables in the field that make the experience truly varied and fresh. In fact, there are many materials, as well as the consumable special attacks that can be purchased: a shower of ducks, flowers that lift up enemy structures or an icy wind that transforms everything into fragile ice. It really seems that the guys from Rovio have set of commitment and Angry Birds Journey is the result of a huge brainstorming from which the most absurd and imaginative things came out, to the full advantage of fun. Also surprising is the enormity of a campaign that currently has five different chapters, each made up of hundreds of levels. Angry Birds Journey, Stella has the power to throw hit objects into the air In short, we are talking about a huge game, in all probability the definitive Angry Birds, but at the same time a product that uses a freemium model that is less elastic than in the past. If, in fact, in the first few hours we will be able to play without any limitations, subsequently we will have to submit to a counter with five lives that are consumed with each failed attempt, requiring several minutes to recharge. The exclusivity of the special powers is also reaffirmed, which can offer an important help within the more difficult levels, but they have a rather expensive cost in gold coins when the latter are not given except very sparingly. In short, to obtain that type of advantage it will necessarily be necessary to put a hand in the wallet and resort to microtransactions. Graphics and sound Angry Birds Journey, the puppies are also trapped inside balloons that you have to get in the air Even from a technical point of view, Angry Birds Journey is like a remake, thanks to a completely new graphic style, which modifies the design of the characters without distorting them. It is in some ways a cross between the representation used for the animated film and the classic one, more ~full-bodied~ and rounded than the original episodes of the series. This interpretation works, there is nois what to say, and fills the screen with beautiful pastel shades that enhance each element of the scenarios, also helping to increase their variety. The sound is less brilliant, which is limited to being functional to the action and does not seem to try with great conviction to propose some theme capable of remaining imprinted in the mind.", "date": "2022-01-29", "grade": "8.5"}
