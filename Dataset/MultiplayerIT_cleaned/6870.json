Between optimizations (real or presumed) of the graphics engine and matchmaking, the expansion of the range of options, the customization possibilities and the challenge park but above all the free addition of new modes and paid maps, in accordance with the programming of a classic and inevitable DLC campaign, the debut title of Respawn Entertainment was able to count on a capillary post-launch support to say the least, to which is added that of the publishing partner, EA, which has often put it on offer on Origin , also dedicating free trial weekends to it. Nothing to do, the haemorrhage of users that began to affect the arenas in which Pilots and Titans battle already a few weeks after their glittering inauguration continued unstoppable. And, as we know, the medical comparison is more fitting than ever in the case of a multiplayer title, because with a declining population, the health and life prospects of the gaming experience are affected, which can drag on more and more tired and inexorable towards death, as the current case of Titanfall would seem, at least in the PC edition, to which the considerations of this article refer. Hence the reason why by scrolling down you probably anticipated that IMC Rising is the first DLC released by the newborn Zampella studio which we do not recommend buying. And this is not because it is a triptych of maps that came out badly, on the contrary, the ability of the developers based in Sherman Oaks to come up with intricate level design solutions continues to surprise, through which to dissect the duality of the game formula in always different ways , but because you would simply run the big risk of spending your money unnecessarily. Here is the review of IMC Rising, the latest Titanfall DLC: the swan song? Hot air and fresh air IMC Rising adds two new entries to a list that is now grotesque, so long has the slew of playlists you can choose from once you start playing. In reality Respawn had the intelligence to deviate towards another mode or group of maps in the case (far from remote...) in which the search for a specific type of content proves unsuccessful instead of taking there prisoners of very long waits or bouncing to the previous screen, but the fact remains that today the failure of a certain way of setting up multiplayer experiences that has taken hold since the time of the first Xbox Live and which definitively established itself last generation, with Call of Duty. And this is even more so on PC, a land that in terms of online gaming has a tradition with certainly broader and more liberal views and would still have all the conditions to honor it. Feeling forced to add lists after lists that lead to nothing but fragmenting the user is not at all good for the health of a multiplayer title, let alone one that can now count on very few users. It would be time to abandon the idea of matchmaking, especially when in fact it turns out to be a red herring that matches don't balance them very much or whose algorithms subject them to exhausting waits or reiterations of the same maps, and go back to the old and healthy browser servers, which allow you to get straight to the point - play - while granting the possibility of choosing exactly what, how, where and with how many people. Among other things, it would be appropriate to talk about three new playlists, given that an update has arrived together with the DLC, 1.0.7.2, which introduces the ST mode with Pilota, which was rumored months ago. It is a Titan Survival limited to two against two, probably born to make a virtue of necessity, which does exactly what one imagines: to propose the older sister in a more intimate, fast key and heralding new implications at the game level of team, resulting from the greater interdependence with the only partner who supports you. A variant that stands up quite well, proving to be even less inclined to get lost in delays caused by couples who play it mainly as a throw-in, ~camperando~, as could be feared. Three guilty IMC Rising offers a trio of maps that can instantly stand out, already at first glance. More than working on new assets, chand in any case there is no shortage, although more recycling is perceived than in the past, Respawn has invested in lighting, as and even more than in the previous DLCs, managing to give each new entry a marked aesthetic personality even in a context that includes at this point beyond 20 arenas, through solutions that seem to be clearly inspired by other titles (or throw the gauntlet to their respective authors). Set in a lush tropical valley at sunset, Calma Piatta seems to scream ~we can redo Crysis inside the Source!~, Proposing a scenario and above all a photograph that is very reminiscent of the Crytek series, especially in the orange-tinged variation appreciated in Warhead. Structurally it seems to be in the presence of a large stratified pie, which although including a multitude of buildings in the peripheral areas, including bars, houses and warehouses, tends to develop around the large central hill, where an imposing and highly articulated building rises alternating a gut of interiors and a series of clearings that can be traveled by the Titans, in which not even a mighty pair of long walls are missing to dominate everything, to be ridden in parkour, provided you don't suffer from vertigo. But this is nothing compared to the incredible crossings that can be made in the apparently very obvious Sand Trap, which seems to mimic the extra-planetary panoramas of Destiny, turning them into a blue  la Soderbergh. Beneath its placid surface, a large desert expanse interrupted from time to time by some warehouse, the heart of a network of underground passages beats very fast, to be crossed at warp speed, on one's own legs, thanks to which the infantry can move substantially undisturbed between a nerve point and the other. In short, an ambivalent soul, with the soil dominated by the Titans, free to let off steam as in a war between Jaeger and Kaij, while the Pilots have several chances to prove to be decisive in any case, especially in the objective modes. Cloaked in a crepuscular but at the same time dazzling bath of light, as if you were in a Mirror's Edge set in the parts of Prypiat, Zone 18 is another map with an apparently banal plan that nevertheless highlights, once again, the talent of the Zampella team in reworking all the strong concepts underlying the level design of Titanfall. It is an industrial installation made up mostly of basements, whose roofs in some cases can also be beaten by the Titans, offering the giants extra maneuvering space, while the soldiers are guaranteed plenty of room for action, moving without exposing themselves too much between the many buildings, cutting through a couple of fast transversal corridors or venturing into some rooms that develop several floors underground. The result is one of the most flowing and balanced maps ever made by Respawn, regardless of the unit of choice (human or robotic) with which to contribute to the conflict. In short, having anticipated the usual scotto for a high but now standard price for proposals of this kind, IMC Rising is a successful map pack, a dish without too many spices of those which, bite after bite, however, never seems to get boring, lending itself to being played and overplayed by fans. Too bad that it is precisely this last type of material that is in hiding. We tested the DLC basically in three tranches: the first in the days close to the launch, the second some time after and the last just before closing the article and the results have always been a bit disheartening. It has now reached the point where being able to find games with two full teams is becoming the exception rather than the rule. Also with reference to Attrition, elected by Respawn itself as the most popular mode. Titanfall today resembles one of those parties where excellent music continues to play and the managers take care to stuff the buffet, but in which nobody is interested in participating, putting on a deep sadness. And at this point we just can't imagine any event capable of reversing the trend, not even an extreme and somewhat improbable breakthrough in Free 2 Play, given that the real problem would seem to be able to sell the desire to play Titanfall to those who Titanfall already has it.", "date": "2014-10-05", "grade": null}
