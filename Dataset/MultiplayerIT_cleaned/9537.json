Taking into consideration the Wii area, these potentials have actually developed with a certain definition over the long term, between ups and downs, through a path that has seen the emergence of some pearls of absolute value on the contemporary videogame market. Compared to the total number of games released on WiiWare, the average value of the titles present is not excellent, but the amount of ~must have~ games has been increasing convincingly in recent months. With pleasure, we can also include Hydroventure (Fluidity, in the American version) in the list of games of sure interest within the digital delivery for Wii. As already seen in other cases belonging to the indie panorama, the fundamental concept is entirely based on the exploitation of physical simulation and, in particular, on its application on the behavior of fluids subjected to inclination. The idea is elementary but opens up great possibilities within a puzzle game, as well as being particularly suitable for the use of the motion-sensing controller: with the Wii Remote, the axis of the game world is tilted, thus modifying the reactions of a mass of water which consequently moves, flows, leaps or collects. An idea with an almost zen simplicity but able to pose very intense challenges to the player, thanks to a well-balanced level design full of variations on the theme. Clear, fresh and sweet waters The story itself is somewhat abstruse, on the other hand predictable having to be the backdrop to an ~aquatic puzzle~, an already rather strange concept. Although the absolute protagonist is water, the whole question starts from a book, a magical tome called ~Acquatiens~ on whose pages the game in question actually takes place. The book asks the player for help to free its pages from the ~Oscuressence~, a sort of polluting and somehow sentient essence that has contaminated all the colorful settings contained in the book with its dark scents. The means by which it is possible to put things right is a mass of water, with which the player can interact mainly indirectly, through the inclination of the game scenario by simply swinging the Wii Remote held horizontally. Physics applied to the fluid does the rest, making the water flow inside the cavities, along the inclined walls or through the tangled labyrinths of pumps, gears and various mechanisms placed so as to create numerous different roads that lead to different landscapes from clean up. This creates a challenge that runs on two different levels: a constant and intrinsic one, given by the need to ~bring~ the water where you want it, imposing the right timing and the right sensitivity in making it flow exactly along the chosen paths, the another more contingent and correlated to the particular situation set in place within the various ~scenes~ of the book, which may require various performances. The latter vary from extinguishing fires to carrying objects with water up to certain points, or from watering plants to cleaning more or less aggressive ~spots~ and are resolved with the acquisition of rainbow drops, the collection of which it is needed to restore order within the Acquatiens. The puzzles become more complicated and progressively deepened during the game thanks to the acquisition of new skills such as the ability to blow up water, to make it condense and ~explode~ or assuming the frozen or gaseous form on command. Small illustrated world Hydroventure is made up of four main ~worlds~ that represent the chapters that make up the Acquatiens book, each in turn subdivided into further settings that follow one another like the illustrations on the pages. Designed with graceful 2D graphics enriched by three-dimensional elements, the game maintains a refined and relaxing aspect, always pleasant to look at, counterbalancing in several cases the nervousness that can arise from more complex situations, especially in the more advanced stages of the game. In general, the aesthetic aspect of this Curve and Nintendo production remains at excellent levels, even considering the WiiWare context. Also noteworthy is the quantity of the offplayful game, which in addition to requiring several hours to collect the rainbow drops pushes you to explore the levels more deeply in search of hidden puzzle fragments, which allow you to unlock new mini-games. The level design is generally well structured, making even the simple exploration of the levels pleasant, with numerous different situations and a progressive block structure and secret passages that somehow recall the type of exploration present in Metroid, to give a bold example . However, there are some flaws in this sector that are rather annoying: first of all, the sense of bewilderment that can be felt after the first drops collected, when one is asked to reach more distant places on the map but without very precise indications in this regard, especially if the game resumes after a more or less long break in which we detached ourselves from the ~mind maps~ created during the longer sessions. Problem partially mitigated by the presence of ~teleporters~ but still present. Another strange feature is the possibility of repeating the collection of an already conquered rainbow drop with consequent ~congratulations~ and return to the beginning of the level, which can be annoying if the drop in question is accidentally hit after several minutes of wandering, but even in this case it is a minor defect.", "date": "2011-01-04", "grade": "9.0"}
