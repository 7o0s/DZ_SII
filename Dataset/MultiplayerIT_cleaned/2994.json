To foil the threat, he decides to form a team with the various Sulleys, Buzz Lightyear, Scrooge McDuck, Jack Sparrow, Baymax but also Bella, Rapunzel, Minnie, Mulan and Merida in their heroic versions, to face the enemies within a campaign that currently has two chapters, each divided into different acts and stages. Gameplay Disney Mirrorverse is in fact a gacha, but don't be scared: unlike the bad One-Punch Man: Road to Hero 2.0, the game developed by Kabam has a gameplay proper, which draws on the classic RPG mechanics with clashes that in in this case they take place in real time. The members of our party launch themselves automatically towards the closest targets, but we can direct their attacks with a touch of the screen, move them in case of danger, activate their super moves and even manage them separately to exploit any extra benefits from the traditional class system. We must also consider that the gacha dynamics are quite limited for the moment, given that the roster is made up of only fourteen unlockable characters and therefore the bulk of the ~fishing~ that can be carried out using the crystals collected (or purchased through microtransactions) revolves around to extra items with which to enrich the equipment of each individual unit. As mentioned above, there are classes to determine the type of fighter at our disposal: Rapunzel, for example, fights brandishing the iconic frying pan, at close range, as well as the small but irascible Minnie; while Bella and Buzz Lightyear strike from distance. Although not particularly large, the roster guarantees a good degree of variety thanks to the characteristics of each character and the growth path that can be undertaken by spending the virtual credits earned along the way. After that, once in the field, the experience sometimes reveals chaotic but undoubtedly spectacular and equipped with a minimum of thickness: maintaining this type of setting in real time it is difficult to think of better solutions than those adopted for the game by the Kabam boys. That said, a certain degree of repetitiveness is inevitable given that the bosses are nothing more than dark copies of the fourteen available characters, and between one mission and another we therefore find ourselves fighting in situations that are always very similar, with the only difference of the quantity and tenacity of the opponents, as well as of course the setting. An indicator of the energy of the action regulates our possibility of continuing to play, but the wait for the top-ups is not very long and they are often given as gifts: you will hardly be left speechless dry for more than a few minutes. Technical realization A tie-in based on the Disney universe cannot avoid a technical realization of a certain level, and from this point of view Disney Mirrorverse does not disappoint: net of shades that are often too dark, perhaps adjusted in this way to underline the different atmospheres from the usual, the Kabam branded title boasts truly convincing polygonal models equipped with excellent animations, especially as regards the spectacular special moves, which give life to a close-up shot of the hero on duty. Unfortunately, there are also several small glitches that would have need a polish, even in the sound sector which can also boast fitting and engaging music. It's also a pity that there are no options to make the graphics more or less heavy: on iPad Pro the game struggles a bit and we don't dare to imagine how it can run on the terminals of a few years ago.", "date": "2020-07-22", "grade": "7.2"}
