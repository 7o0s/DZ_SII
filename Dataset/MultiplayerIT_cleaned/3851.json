But here we are again: we played Rules, the second of five episodes planned for the new series of narrative adventures by Dontnod Entertainment; a sequel inevitably awaited with very high expectations from the gamer public and specialized critics, because the first Life is Strange has not only filled a place on the shelf of its videogame collection, but also a little space in one's heart . The adventures of Sean and Daniel continue, and we tell you how the work of Dontnod Entertainment is progressing within this completely spoiler-free review, except of course what you should already know after playing the first episode of the series. Plot: between Rules and Wolves The second episode of Life is Strange 2 is called Rules (Rules) and arrives a good four months after the previous Life is Strange 2 - Roads; inevitably the memory of some players must have been a bit clouded, but to make up the mind immediately helps a nice introductory film that tells the previous events just like a fairy tale whispered around the fireplace. Sean and Daniel take on the appearance of two fugitive wolf cubs, forced to leave their den due to a hunter who exterminated their family: if you have played the first episode of Life is Strange 2 you will be very well able to grasp the allusions of the cinematic , while if you haven't already done so you should at least ask yourself why you are reading this review. Immediately after Life is Strange 2 - Rules recovers the narrative almost exactly where it was left off: Sean, Daniel and the little dog continue their journey to a safe place, while the Oregon winter does not grant them any respite. From a more general point of view, the second episode of Life is Strange 2 does not offer truly noteworthy twists or situations characterized by palpable tension, however the magical touch of Dontnod Entertainment is felt more than ever in the presentation of unpublished characters very well characterized and naturally in many small precious details, now in outlining an aspect of the personality of Sean and Daniel that we had previously ignored, now in placing in a given room an object endowed with particular narrative or quotation value (a letter, a souvenir of a trip, a poster, and so on). But there is a much more important aspect that we feel compelled to underline when we talk about the ~magic touch~ of Dontnod Entertainment: however trivial many of the situations described may seem (a breakfast, a car trip), however many rooms are definitely the same as those we deal with in everyday life, their game is still memorable. It happens to play Life is Strange 2 and then go back to doing something else, but something always comes to mind: the adventures told and their way of telling them leaves an imprint on the player's conscience; perhaps it is for this reason that in its time the first Life is Strange imposed itself on the attention of the mass with such force. As far as the specific plot of the second episode is concerned, we cannot tell you much without falling into annoying anticipations, therefore we will limit ourselves to confirming what Square Enix and Dontnod Entertainment have made public about Rules: Sean and Daniel reach their maternal grandparents' house, hoping that can provide them with help (even if only momentarily); before starting the episode, the Life is Strange 2 save file will retrieve that of Captain Spirit, and this in itself should allow you to make some considerations on the presence of little Chris. Some of the themes and situations addressed during the episode are the contrast between imposed rules and free will, respect, the world of family affections, and of course the player is led to look ever more deeply at the relationship between the two brothers, fighting against everything and everyone to stay together. Gameplay Life is Strange 2 was born, continues and will arrive at its destination as a narrative adventure that alternates films and cinematics with third-person game sessions where we can control the character of Sean, the older of the two Diaz brothers. Game mechanics and ideas have been taken over from the first season of Life is Strange and already in the first episode Roads we pointed out how little or nothing was innovative, except of course for the due variations of the case. If before FrI was the only novelty was the possibility of being able to control his little brother Daniel as Sean, calling him when he lost sight of him and discussing various environmental elements with him, now it is also possible to ask him to use his powers. This addition is activated only in rare situations and almost always remains optional: for example, you could decide to open a padlock using a key (but first you will have to look for it) or much more quickly by making Daniel force it with his telekinetic powers. The progression in the main adventure remains bound to the player's pace, depending on whether he prefers to explore each environment calmly, talking to everyone and reading all the documents present, or rushing quickly towards the conclusion of each level (which usually coincides with a new day game or with certain settings); with three hours of play, however, you will be able to finish Rules feeling fully satisfied. Although not particularly relevant for the purposes of the narrative, we also appreciated the various ~choices~ and crossroads proposed by the developers: it was not always easy to decide which was the right action in a given circumstance, but the weight of the choice is felt more than ever because it seems that it will affect the emotional and personal growth of little Daniel. Rules continues to provoke, among other things, the player's ethics, questioning the existence of right ways of acting regardless: life is unpredictable, and often doing the right thing proves to be very difficult, especially for the two little protagonists who have already had to face so many misadventures.", "date": "2019-01-22", "grade": "8.0"}
