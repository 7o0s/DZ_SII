{"name": "Disney's Tarzan Freeride", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disneys-tarzan-freeride-2.html", "text": "I didn't imagine that expressing an opinion about this Tarzan Freeride would cost me a lot of effort, I thought I would have dismissed the matter briefly. Instead, I found myself thinking long and hard about analyzing the game and writing this review. Although this Disney Interactive title can easily and simplistically be considered one of the many low-profile commercial productions, designed to exploit a character (or a brand, in general) which currently enjoys a certain popularity (although the Disney film is been out for two years already), it cannot be denied, however, that some interesting ideas appear here and there (to then disappear definitively, in any case). Ultimately, the typical characteristics of a tie-in can be found: interesting literary or cinematographic background, some original ideas, a lame technical realization, a lot of haste and little respect for gamers. Honestly, I could close here too, keeping faith with my initial hypothesis, but so much so that I'm here, I'll express a more detailed opinion. Tarzan's Scream Terrorizes the (Black) Continent Paraphrasing the title of a famous film by/with Bruce Lee, I meant to express a basic concept: Tarzan is strong, occasionally cunning, surely lucky and the worst enemy of every criminal adventurer. This video game aims to tell some events that occurred after those narrated in the Disney blockbuster: a certain Oswald Gardner, the mad scientist on duty, wants to capture as many gorilla puppies as possible to subject them to who knows what misleading experiments and studies. Obviously ours will not sit idly by and will once again put himself at the service of his ~people~, vanquishing the scientific expedition and its evil intentions. The only unexpected event: during the story, Jane will also be captured to be subjected to studies as a ~female~ of the pseudo-sapiens hominid which Tarzan appears to Gardner's eyes. As usual, the hero will save his beloved. Fast and Furious(?) It is difficult to clearly describe the game structure of Tarzan Freeride, in fact it is impossible to categorize it within a specific genre. Whether for the physical structure of the levels, for the objectives to be completed, for the actions that can be performed, this video game is closer to the genre of racing and extreme sports than to that of action/adventure or even less to that of platformers (if only Miyamoto saw everything in the square, sigh...). Essentially, Tarzan can walk, run, jump, punch, throw spears and unleash his unmistakable scream. In his mission, he will have to go through 15 game levels, set in three different thematic areas (jungle, swamps, caves), at the same time freeing the little gorillas, defending himself against wild beasts and chasing away the human invaders. In truth, the main purpose is to reach the end of the level, to then face the next one and the one after that, a bit like in the videogames of fifteen/twenty years ago. No puzzles, 100% action. Each level is a full throttle towards the end of the same, running and sliding, flying from vine to vine, jumping on bouncing mushrooms and running and jumping again, so on until the end. We will then have to face (and win) three fun bungee jumping competitions to earn the respect of the gorillas, whose help along each level will be determined to reach otherwise precluded locations. Once the main adventure has been completed, (time three/four skimpy hours of play) we will finally be able to dedicate ourselves to the true soul of this Disney title: tests of speed and skill along the fifteen aforementioned levels. In fairness it must be said that Tarzan will not only have to run and jump among the high branches of the trees, but also engage in daring rafting and water skiing tests. The skill tests consist in performing as many super moves as possible by scoring more points than our friend-opponent Terk (a bit like the one we knew as Cita). These super moves are obtained by combining (in a very simple and restrictive way) the use of the C stick and the A and R buttons and in any case they can also be performed in adventure mode or in speed tests. The latter is the funnest game mode: running at breakneck speed down the fifteen levels is an exciting experience (at least the first two times for each one). Winning Terk also in this test we will have access to a combined test of speed and skill (tedious and useless). Overcoming all threeand tests for each of the fifteen levels we will unlock three new super moves and three other characters to use in them. Honestly, I didn't find the stimulus sufficient to conclude these tests (it awaits me better at other mini-DVDs) and above all I felt the lack of a multiplayer mode, which certainly would have helped this title: challenging a few friends in the various tests would have been much more exhilarating than winning the immutable record of the hateful Terk. And for the roof... a sieve Technically the game is only fair. But that was to be expected. Graphically we are far from the prodigies of titles such as Rogue Leader and Wave Race, but overall the various wild settings have been recreated in a pleasant and detailed way, even if the polygonal models appear simple and often some textures are of low quality, jarring with the others . Light effects and basic particles, pop-up more unique than rare, good reflections even though water is nothing more than a simple specular surface (a pure mirror). Tarzan's animations, on the other hand, are pleasant and the transition from one to another is quite fluid. Ah, by the way, the view is a bird's eye (without the possibility of any intervention) behind our hero, the beauty is that it is also functional and generally free from chronic defects. The audio sector is perhaps the most successful one. If in the adventure mode the tribal 'jungles' alternate in a rather anonymous (but never annoying) way, during the various rehearsals they are replaced by pressing, somewhat rocking and vaguely jazzy motifs of excellent workmanship and worthy of listening; definitely the best thing this video game has to offer. The dubbing (even in Italian) is in my opinion unpleasant: flat, toneless, distant. However, the voice actors of Prof. Porter and Gardner manage. And for the roof... a sieve Pros: Wild atmosphere spot on Sometimes valuable music Fun speed tests ... Cons: ... at least for a while No puzzles Limited and not at all exciting action capabilities Flat and predictable plot Only fair technical realization", "date": "2002-05-21", "grade": null}
