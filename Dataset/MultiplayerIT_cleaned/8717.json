We are talking about Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack, an evolved sequel to that Tales from Space: About a Blob made last year again in this period, but for PlayStation 3, by Drinkbox Studios. The game is a platform with mainly horizontal scrolling puzzle elements and with two-dimensional graphics that closely resemble similar titles very popular at the time of 16-bit consoles. The scheme of each of the levels that make up the main adventure, which is also the only real mode available (from the main menu you can only access the cutscenes, options and online rankings, as well as the story mode), is very simple in the concept: you have to go from point A to point B. To do this there is no pre-defined way or time limit, in the sense that you can act as you think best to get to the end, and indeed you are almost invited to explore every corner of the scenario and to experiment with various solutions and paths thanks to the presence of objects to collect, as well as numerous and generous checkpoints scattered around the environment and in key points, which make sure you don't have to force the gamer to go back if it meets an untimely end. However, before going into the discussions related to the gameplay of the product better, let's take a quick look at the somewhat amusing plot, which as usual for games of the genre is only an excuse to kick off the adventure. A strange one-eyed gelatinous creature, green in color and spherical in shape, finds itself around the earth and begins to devastate and eat everything, while defending itself from humans who react militarily to what for them is an invasion. Move, press and swipe The player must then guide the gelatinous creature through themed areas (college, city, military base, etc) which are in turn divided into a series of levels bristling with puzzles of increasing difficulty, obstacles and enemies, combining classic controls such as the stick left analog to move the character, the front buttons to make him perform in particular jumps or accelerations, and the triggers to keep him in magnetic balance on metal objects or to make him perform quick ~mini flights~, with the PlayStation Vita touch buttons useful instead for interacting with some elements of the scenario. To take advantage of some of the characteristics of the objects present in an environment, perhaps to move on a level surface or to overcome a particular danger, with the fingers one proceeds to use or move platforms, platforms and so on, which are generally highlighted by an aura greenish. Just to make the idea even better, perhaps it is appropriate to give a couple of examples. In one level of the game there is a sort of incandescent base on the ground by touching which one meets certain death, and the creature is right between two safe rock spikes positioned just on the sides of the boiling mass. Well, to overcome it and get to the opposite side unharmed, you press the fingertip on a big hammer and drag it so as to draw an ideal trajectory that attracts the object towards the character which, hitting him, will hurl him to safety. Another situation, another objective: to recover objects positioned in an unreachable point to feed on them. Still using Vita's touchscreen, an elevator and a pair of rotating mechanical arms must be maneuvered to ensure that the aforementioned ~food~ is moved to get it downwards between the loving jaws of the nice blob. However, when needed, the latter sticks everywhere, from roofs to pipes to walls, slipping thanks to its soft composition into the narrowest crevices, including huge gears or narrow spaces that open in some walls. And in doing what has just been described, it devours and absorbs anything, even human beings, obtaining in return as it does a certain growth in terms of size, ability (magnetism, ability to fly, etc) and resistance, and acquiring points useful for determining a certain result at the end of each stage. Science fiction from the 50s The latter also takes into account other factors such as for example the finding of what are defined as the monster's ~friends~ (there are two hidden in each level), and the best score obtained can be shared via the internet with a classification. However, each session can be replayed as many times as you want, so as to allow the user to try again to beat his previous record.d or that of the ~opponents~ scattered around the world. There are also extra levels called Tilt-a-blob, where Vita's commands are further enhanced, thanks also to the particular conformity of the scenarios in which they are set and the mini-games they contain. In particular, they take advantage of the Sixaxis support, with the blob which often becomes a sort of ball for the occasion to be moved and rolled along paths built ad hoc by the developers. Also in these cases the objective of each area is mainly to get to the end by eating the objects that can be encountered along your way (the level set between the streets of a futuristic city is funny in this sense) and to avoid making a bad end, while there is less room for finding alternative ways or whatever. We close this review by talking about graphics and audio as always. As regards the first, it must be said that the look of Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack is also very reminiscent of the two-dimensional platform games of the 90s, those for SEGA Megadrive or Super Nintendo to be clear, with a palette of colors that enhances the brilliance of the console screen, while the style adopted to represent skits, environments, monsters and various characters brings to mind those old American comics from the Tales From Space series and those old science fiction films from the 40s and 50s. For the latter, how not to mention the legendary The Blob from 1958 played by the great Steve McQueen, or Thirty million kilometers from the Earth among the sources of inspiration for the developers? Speaking instead of audio, we have a rather interesting soundtrack, even if in some scenarios it seems out of context as it is serious, while nothing particular to report on the rest, especially on the effects, simple but effective as befits a title like this.", "date": "2012-02-27", "grade": "8.4"}
