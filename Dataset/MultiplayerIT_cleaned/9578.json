Of course, there are works that go beyond the boundaries of genre and generation, but more often they are experiences designed with a specific user in mind. This is why it is difficult to evaluate My friend Peppa Pig on a site like Multiplayer.it, populated by a large number of gamers with a certain amount of experience behind them and certain standards to be respected. My Friend Peppa Pig has very little to offer them, apart from some easily unlockable trophies. But if you are here and know how to read, then it means that you are interested in finding out if My Friend Peppa Pig is a video game suitable for the little ones, it doesn't matter if they are children, younger brothers or nephews. In the review of My Friend Peppa Pig we will try to tell you this and the numerical vote will try to summarize the concept: therefore it is useless to compare it with that of the various Halo, The Last of Us or Zelda. It is unique. What do you do The My Friend Peppa Pig character is fully customizable First of all let's start by telling you what My Friend Peppa Pig is. It is a sort of interactive mega-episode of the famous animated series for young children. All that will be required of young users will be to move the fictitious character that can be created to the right or to the left, occasionally pressing the main button to perform a simple action. That's all. The developers will exploit many of Peppa Pig's most famous settings to recreate some of the ~most famous~ moments of the series and give the little ones the impression of being inside the cartoon: every now and then a street will be interrupted by Mr. Bull's work, Daddy Pig will lose his glasses in the house and George will throw Mr. Dinosaur up a tree. All things that those who have seen (and reviewed and reviewed) the English series will know by heart and that it is fun to see re-proposed in a video game. Amazon offer My Friend Peppa Pig - Nintendo Switch 39.99 29.9 See Offer As a new friend of Peppa we will be introduced to her world, we will attend her kindergarten and her friends. We will visit Patata City, but also the Windy Castle, the sea, the mountain and the forest. Don't get any strange ideas: each location consists of 2 or 3 static screens in which to move Peppa and her new friend. But for the little ones, do you really need more? The importance of adaptation in Italian My Friend Peppa Pig is fully dubbed in Italian This is because, as we said at the beginning, My Friend Peppa Pig is designed for the little ones, more precisely for pre-school children or little more. The pace is slow, the tasks required are few and if you get stuck Peppa will suggest what to do. The fact that everything is dubbed in Italian (even if they are not the original voices), moreover, is a significant added value, which allows the little ones to be independent and to be able to play without the need for an adult constantly by their side. We're not saying kids can be left alone in front of the screen, but at least they can learn to use a controller independently and at their own pace in a familiar, safe and fun environment. Also for this reason, longevity on paper takes on another meaning. It is true that an adult, but even an elementary school kid could reach the end credits in a few hours, but we repeat, they are off target. A small child could get lost in it for hours and play over and over the same situations exactly as they have seen and re-watched the episodes on television 200 times. In this case, however, the protagonist will be directly him. Simple but effective All the main characters of the series appear in My Friend Peppa Pig A game like My Friend Peppa Pig could only start from the unmistakable style of the cartoon. A very clean and simple style, which however does not disdain to surprise with some pleasant details. Jumping in puddles you get dirty with mud and the animations are the same as seen in the cartoon. We repeat, nothing shocking, but extremely faithful to the original material. Just as the topics covered are faithful, always very light, harmless and suitable for everyone. Perhaps a few more positive ~messages~ could have been launched (in addition to cleaning the environment), but it's not even right that a video game should have to transmit values to the new generations. As we said, the dubbing in Italian is excellent (even if sometimes out of sync), while inexplicable and many and long loading between one setting and another. Seeing a PS4 Pro take 30 seconds to load a My Friend Peppa Pig screenshot is heartbreaking.", "date": "2021-12-02", "grade": "8.0"}
