Considering myself reasonably resistant to the frightening effects of horror movies and videogames, I confidently approached the installation of FEAR, mindful of having finished DooM 3 between a yawn and a laugh, while only some of the most diabolical survival horror on the market they had induced that delicious and increasingly rare feeling of restlessness. As if that weren't enough, I felt vaguely biased by the sight of the short, sullen figure of the little girl on the cover, kidnapped by The Ring and thrust straight into the role of the paranormal entity in the situation. In a bloody party dress. Well, sometimes it's good to change your mind, even if the kind of ~fear~ inspired by FEAR is on a quite different level from that of the last id shooter, having much more to do with the kind of creepiness - and subsequent leaps on the chair - that you experience in the cinema. In fact, the terrifying aspects of a Doom 3 basically derive from the aversion of our survival instinct to the presence of heinous and repellent creatures nestled in the darkness, ready to jump at our throats despite our Commando arsenal. FEAR on the other hand, rather than a horror shooter, can be considered a multimedia product that is half a traditional FPS (and what FPS!) and half a horror film in the classic haunted house. FEAR, more than a horror shooter, is halfway between a traditional FPS (and what FPS!) and a horror movie in the classic haunted house. But is it really that scary? In fact, fear and unease are caused by the usual ~mezzucci~ we are all fond of (sudden noises in the most absolute silence, lurid and creeping shadows, fleeting apparitions of alienated long-haired brunettes...) but these are elements that have no nothing to do with the action sequences and fights and intervene exclusively in the ~reduced interactivity~ moments, to keep the tension high during the explorations and to gradually tell the details of the plot. Of course, the awareness that ghosts and hallucinations do not they are dangerous and that at every appearance they will scare us so much, but not even a little bad (wellalmost) after a while it tends to cancel the tension.Furthermore, this repeated passing from the atmospheres of Silent Hill to the acrobatic carnage of Max Payne could might not go down well with those who would prefer a heart-pounding horror experience from start to finish, yet it strikes the right balance to prevent the same addictive phenomenon that made the last few chapters of DooM 3 soporific, to say the least. To a hypothetical question, therefore, let's answer that FEAR is scary enough and in the right way. If you want more, watch Dario Argento in his best days. The real Ghostbusters As we have clarified, minus the Poltergeist moments, FEAR is a more paramilitary shooter than paranormal. In the role of the latest addition to a SWAT team of ghostbusters, we play the classic soldier with no name or speech, of which the plot will come to define remarkable backstories, even if not exactly surprising or unexpected: originality is absolutely not a boast for this production, it is worth specifying. Called into action by a sudden emergency in a well-known multinational supplier of the Department of Defense, we find ourselves in pursuit of one Paxton Fettel (the villain with the most unlikely name in the history of video games), a soldier apparently created and raised in the laboratory and endowed with the ability to telepathically control an entire battalion of clone soldiers, for what was supposed to be an experiment for the government. Apparently rebelled, Fettel has carried out a massacre and now, strengthened by the hundreds of powerful and efficient soldiers under his command, he is pursuing his goals, leaving a trail of blood behind him. Who or what controls his moves, of course, is unknown. At first, the feeling you get in maneuvering the character is that of ~The Chronicles of Riddick~. Rather than being the mere human extension of a firearm floating in the air, we have a clear and precise sensation of our virtual ~body~: not only do we have hands and feet, but our way of running and jumping and the fact that small movements are enough to make nearby objects fall or to move the doors of a wardrobe, they communicate in a tangible way our ~physicality~ and the sensation of the volume we occupy. Unfortunately the physics engine isn't as refined as that of Half-Life 2 and its use is purely aesthetic, but in its own way it contributes to the realism of the game in a significant way. The real Ghostbusters Graphically we are at absolutely satisfied levelsdoing. The textures and the general realism of the environments and characters do not reach the Valve masterpiece - still at the state of the art awaiting the next generation titles - and indeed the visual style is somewhat reminiscent of DooM 3, with a not so vague feeling of ~plasticity~ due to the abuse of normal maps even on the wrong surfaces. Yet the amount of polygons, the deployment of pixel shaders (2.0, owners of not brand new cards, don't worry) or the fact that gunshots dig real craters on almost any surface, will manage to impress you, especially when SlowMotion is active. ...the wounded limp, lean against the walls for support and literally writhe under the lash of our bullets... The real Ghostbusters An excellent result for the Lithtech FEAR (this is the name chosen for the new incarnation of the historic Monolith engine) which, although demanding in terms of hardware in offering the best of its potential, turns out to be surprisingly scalable, reaching high resolutions also on the old home system of the good Paolo Matrascia, whose archaic Radeon 9100 was for us the definitive test bench for low-end systems. The sound deserves a full 10. The music is simply perfect for the setting, making an indispensable contribution to the atmosphere and dynamically adapting to the situation with good readiness, while the sound effects are distinguished by both a certain quality and sheer abundance. The animations deserve a particular mention, among the best globally and, by extension, at the undisputed top as regards FPS. The movements of the characters are fluid like water and interact perfectly with the surrounding environment. Not only has the ~skating~ effect finally disappeared, but the wounded limp and lean against the walls to support themselves, just as they literally writhe under the lash of our bullets, trying to shield their faces with their arms. It's amazing the amount of detail that Slow Motion allows to notice, although sometimes it also highlights the flaws the abundance of animations is a great thing, but the transitions between one and the other could have been better . Multiplayer in search of identity Monotonous and not very incisive, the multiplayer option of FEAR adds nothing to the game, resulting, at best, negligible. Built on the three indestructible pillars of Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag, the combination of the incredible destructive power of weapons (with one or two shots, you die) and the extreme speed of action give it a certain personality and a characteristic feeling, but the lack of the horror component and the brightest and most fun gameplay aspect (the excellent Slow Motion, transformed into a mere power-up object of contention) reduces the entire sector within the canons of the already seen. Especially since the lack of this last element tends to flatten the differences between the different weapons, especially at medium and short distances, reminding the player of the reason why years ago online FPSs competed precisely for the most abundant military equipment: the need for variety. Not that FEAR's multiplayer is badly done or isn't fun enough, but after a few minutes you will inevitably ask yourself ~is that all?~. Certainly the few maps - monotonous like the single player counterparts - do not make a significant contribution. Final comment The main flaw of FEAR is a uniform level design without personality, which for an FPS does not go beyond mere custom. Apart from this and a rather insignificant multiplayer section, the game earns full marks in all circumstances, from a technical sector that is always up to par, to the simply exhilarating playability, an encouraging sign of a possible evolutionary direction for the genre, after years of stagnation. And it's not just a matter of SlowMotion. However, don't expect to remain ten hours curled up on the keyboard in the throes of panic attacks: the ~fear~ referred to in the title (we prefer to ignore the real meaning of the vile acronym that gives its name to our special unit) is a game of rhythm and accumulation of tension - with some occasional jump on the chair - which has little to do with the fights to the Matrix which are instead the backbone of the game itself. Finally, Vivendi deserves an earful for the level of Italian dubbing. If that of Half-Life 2 was passable at best, that of FEAR does not earn enough, distinguishing itself particularly for the absolute lack of personality and participation on the part of the interpreters, who literally kill the atmosphere with flat voices and impersonal even when I giveshould belong to a wounded or terrified character (or both!). On this aspect, it's time for a change! Pros Great graphics and flawless sound State-of-the-art combat Brilliant AI Cons Forgettable level design Underwhelming multiplayer Mediocre Italian voice acting Guns, big guns Many of the actions and interactions performed by enemies are due to an artificial intelligence of excellent caliber. The scripted events are practically absent (they only affect the horror sequences, where we are little more than spectators), and the behavior of the opponents depends from time to time on the situation. For example, a sentry in a room, if he spots us from behind a window, won't think twice about breaking through it with an athletic leap worthy of an ibex, often catching us by surprise. Conversely, were we to approach from another direction, our presence could be betrayed by the sound of our footsteps or by the light of the torch, in which case the marrano could simply decide to shoot us from a distance, throw a grenade or slip out the back door to join reinforcements or try to go around us. ...you'll be amazed to watch an enemy shot from behind run towards a couch, grab it, and yank it around in your direction so you can use it for cover. Guns, big guns Replaying a save in search of a better performance, it is not uncommon to find yourself repeating a firefight according to completely different rules simply according to the different reactions of the individual members of the enemy teams, triggered by a simple change of our position or by having opened our offensive with a weapon of a different kind. The adaptability of the AI is amazing, to the point that you will be amazed to watch an enemy caught from behind run towards a sofa, grab it and twist it with a violent jerk in your direction, so that you can use it for cover. Which finally leads us to talk about the extraordinary fights, the flagship of FEAR: there are only eight weapons available (plus three types of mines/grenades) but of absolute quality, balanced and extremely specialized and the clashes vary greatly depending on prefer short or long range, automatic or single shot weapons. Once the firefight has begun and the SlowMotion has been activated, a real dance of death begins, with trails and clouds of bullets that graze us, while with grace and precision we pass from one target to another, from one headshot to another. following, occasionally punctuated by a devastating melee attack. Guns, big guns If fighting with the world slowed down and senses developed is the graceful ballet of a ninja, once our ~concentration~ is exhausted, the firefights become a hundred, a thousand times faster and more violent. In FEAR weapons cause tremendous damage, especially at close range, and suddenly finding yourself without SlowMotion and surrounded by super-soldiers means certain death. Furthermore, the fact of being able to carry only three weapons with him accentuates this feeling of realism and reduces the omnipotence complex common to many FPS, where towards the end of the game the protagonist tends to resemble a gunboat. However, the negative side is that, given the extreme specialization of the weapons, every time one is found on the ground unattended, not only does one sense that a fight awaits us in a few seconds, but one also has a rather precise indication what the scenario will be like, whether the bad guys will be in close range or attacking from a distance and even if they are normal infantry or armored ones. More ''pictures'' than ''levels'' Another more relevant flaw is the direct consequence of an uninspired level design. Like DooM 3, FEAR disguises its linearity by occasionally inserting forks along the path of the levels, which will eventually rejoin, usually in conjunction with the clash of an enemy team, which thus has the opportunity to try to catch us behind. Sometimes these crossroads are so wide that once they rejoin they form a real circuit, with the result that once you get to the junction point you can find yourself taking the alternative route backwards, thus finding yourself at the starting point. Not a big deal for those wishing to explore every inch for precious health and reflex boosters, but the possibility of occasionally becoming disoriented should be taken into account, especially in light of the fact that the levels themselves essentially take place in two settings : aseptic corporate offices and a degraded industrial suburb.
