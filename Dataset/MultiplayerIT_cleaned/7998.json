Luckily, the current generation of consoles has brought with it the explosion of digital delivery, a tool through which they have been able to see the light of games that otherwise in all probability would not have been able to reach store shelves. In this specific case, Nintendo has therefore chosen to implement a particular strategy for the Picross series and, ideally approaching the product to a sort of ~Puzzle Week type~ publication which obviously by natural affinity is quite spot on: create mini chapters, real ~ numbers~, to be offered a short distance from each other at an affordable price. And so, after the first episode that reached the eShop at the beginning of September, a little more than 4 months later, this Picross e2 also landed on the same channel, which keeps form and substance almost completely intact. Effortlessly Anyone who buys The Puzzle Week knows exactly what to expect from each new issue: identical shape, unchanged structure, with new puzzles and puzzles. Picross e2 behaves in a similar way, guaranteeing the buyer an absolutely familiar and immediately recognizable environment having played the first chapter; even the menu and organization of the contents are completely identical, except for the different green color theme, thus allowing you to go without fail towards the nonograms without losing even a moment too long. And the quantity and division of the puzzles has also remained unchanged, with a total of 150 different patterns contained in modes called Easy, Normal, Free and Extra. These differ in the basic rules, with the simplest ones in which errors are notified and signaled by time penalties, and the others instead where the player is left in total freedom. Too bad that the maximum dimensions are always limited to 15x15 grids, rather small for the more experienced Picross fans used to something else. That the Picross series is intended to introduce nonograms to those who know little or nothing about them rather than to guarantee a high level of challenge for veterans is quite clear, yet with this second episode an ~extra~ has been added that is certainly welcome too to the latter group of players; we are talking about the Micross, a name under which a not new but very interesting game formula is hidden. In summary, these are ~Matryoshka~ nonograms measuring 80x80: once the simple main 8x8 puzzle is completed, in fact, each single square itself leads to another nonogram, which helps to reveal the detailed and complex final image from a famous painting. Although also in this case never constituting a truly complex exercise, the Micross bring a breath of freshness and require a certain commitment (at least time) to be solved in such a way as to be appreciated in a particular way. It is a pity that overall this additional mode has only 5 puzzles, but at the price of  4.99 we think there is very little to complain about overall. Finally, as regards interface, technique and use of the second screen, we refer you to the review of the first episode since everything has remained practically unchanged. The 3D effect Virtually completely absent, as with the first episode, but obviously it is a game that lends itself very little to its exploitation.", "date": "2013-02-18", "grade": "7.4"}
