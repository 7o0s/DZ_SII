Ray Gigant, however, takes a completely different path. Also developed by Experience, this new dungeon crawler stands as the ideal alternative to get closer to the genre, especially if you've lived on bread and Final Fantasy so far: in a certain sense, in fact, this strange hybrid is very reminiscent of JRPGs classics, but if it's good or bad you'll find out only by continuing to read our review ... Ray Gigant is a decent starting point for those who have never approached the dungeon crawler genre School of monsters The first thing you need to understand, when trying to frame Ray Gigant, is that this time Experience has preferred to move away from one of the canons that often characterize its RPGs: instead of proposing a vague story that leaves much more room for gameplay, the developer Japanese focused on the script and on the characterization of the various characters, embroidering around them a structure that only partially recalls its usual dungeon crawlers such as Demon Gaze or the aforementioned Stranger of Sword City. The result is interesting, but not entirely convincing. The amount of texts - completely in English - to read between one mission and another is often exorbitant and, after starting the first game, you set foot in the introductory dungeon after almost twenty minutes of dialogue. However, this setup is necessary to establish the context of the story and present the protagonist of Ray Gigant, as well as his initial supporting actors, to which will be added the various characters around which the subsequent chapters revolve and the different points of view they offer on the story. The problem with the screenplay, however, does not lie in the length of the conversations, but in the way in which they were written or, better to say, translated: the language used in the adaptation is really childish and it often seems like you are reading a cartoon novice author. Unfortunately, the impression is consolidated by the decidedly unoriginal premises: in the near future, the world is under siege by the Gigants, enormous monsters that the army is unable to fight in the slightest. Some individuals, however, begin to manifest the devastating powers of the Yorigami, symbiotic entities that appear in the form of weapons and can possess and transform the bodies of their guests: the protagonist Ichiya Amakaze will find out the hard way, destroying half of Tokyo, but a secret association will take care to place him in his school for, uh, gifted young people, so that he can learn to use his newfound powers to defeat the Gigants. As you may have guessed, the plot of the game is a gigantic clich of Japanese animation that mixes the key elements of famous series such as Evangelion, Attack on Titan or Project ARMS. And so far there would be nothing wrong, if most of the characters weren't terribly unpleasant. It is certainly not the first time that the fate of the world ends up in the hands of an awkward teenager, but the impatient tones with which the various supporting actors address Ichiya make the reading of their interactions heavy, and it is not easy to get involved in the plot of Ray Gigant when the protagonist is more clumsy than Shinji Ikari. PSVita trophies The 42 Trophies available are divided into 24 bronze, 16 silver and 3 gold trophies, to which must be added the inevitable platinum trophy. Most are unlocked along the way, completing the various missions of the game and putting into practice what is explained in the tutorials, but some will require more effort and meticulousness. The labyrinth of kaiju At school it is possible to socialize with the other characters, save the game, manage the inventory and eat at the common canteen: this last activity already demonstrates the way in which Ray Gigant tries to diversify from the usual dungeon crawlers, implementing the weight mechanism. In fact, when the characters eat out and during the fights, they put on a few pounds, becoming stronger and more resistant, but also more awkward: in terms of gameplay, this translates into the need to find the individual balance of each character, taking into account actions taken during fights burn calories and reduce weight. In this sense, Ray Gigant is full of original ideas that stratify his role-playing component. The exploration took placege in first person, as is the tradition in dungeon crawlers, in graphically somewhat rough labyrinths that begin to show the developer's muscles only from the second chapter onwards: if the first dungeons may appear too simple and predictable, the subsequent ones begin to serve traps and pitfalls that force us to think three-dimensionally. Enemies are visible on the map in the form of skulls and the colors of these icons represent the difficulty of the encounter, although not in the traditional sense: the enemies are basically the same, but the actions selected during battle consume more or less Action Points. In fact, the entire combat system revolves around this indicator. Each character has three actions available (even if they become six, at a certain point in the game) which can be configured as desired by selecting those already learned. Each action consumes AP and the player is free to choose the number of actions that each fighter must carry out, choosing whether and how much to unload the common stock of Action Points. The gauge recharges between fights, but never fully; it is therefore necessary to evaluate whether to face a new clash without the possibility of defending oneself or to beat a retreat, recover and return to the attack later. In these moments the dungeon crawler nature of Ray Gigant bursts out, even if bizarre mechanics such as the Slash Beat Mode (a sort of rhythm game that allows the characters to violently attack the enemies) or the Parasite system, which drains the life points instead of the AP, they remind us every time we are faced with something very different from the usual. Likewise, the decidedly original growth system left us a bit dumbfounded. Characters don't level up by gaining experience points like in most other RPGs; it is the player who decides how to spend the resources collected in the dungeons in individual skill trees, not only increasing the parameters of the various characters, but teaching them attacks and spells, or upgrading their weapons. It is a system easier to use than to explain, but unfortunately Experience has not managed to balance it properly, and it is enough to accumulate resources in the very first dungeons, when the difficulty - in any case never particularly high - is more permissive, to excessively boost even just one character with which it will become a walk to asphalt every enemy in a few attacks, including bosses. An inanimate soul Speaking of the bosses, we must admit that the clashes with the real Gigants, the gigantic ones who set the city on fire in the climactic moments of the game, are among the most spectacular we have ever played in a Japanese RPG. In these situations, the party is forced to split up and attack the enemy from completely different angles: in practical terms, practically nothing changes, but the solution devised by Experience serves not only to increase the tension, but also and above all to make the battles truly memorable. We're talking about creatures that tower over the skyscrapers of Tokyo, gargantuan beings that the small PlayStation Vita screen fails to depict in their entirety. In the moments in which we have to choose the actions of our characters, the game frames them from behind, as they whirl their weapons with very fluid animations in front of the ugly muzzle of the monster of the moment who can't wait to devour them: between the camera angle and the postures of the fighters, it literally feels like watching a Japanese cartoon, while the details of the beautiful sprites representing the enemy creatures remind us of the nature of the game. The illusion unfortunately decays at the precise moment in which the choice of actions is confirmed and the actual combat begins: then the camera switches to framing the action in first person, as per the dungeon crawler tradition, and each attack is represented through a trivial graphic effect accompanied by an equally common sound effect. The excellent enemy sprites are barely animated, whether they are simple minions or the immense Gigant on duty, and if it weren't for the short cartoonish cinematics triggered by the Slash Beat Mode there would be very little spectacular in the game fights. The completely opposite discourse instead applies to the soundtrack, composed by Jimbo Naoaki: the name of this musician may not tell you anything, but he is talented and his songs have pleasantly accompanied us for hours, not only in the most apt way possible, but also surprising us with their instrumental variety.", "date": "2016-04-29", "grade": "7.0"}
