We know that the news of such a shocking novelty in the videogame field could cause surprise and disbelief in readers, but we confirm what has just been said: Wings of Prey is, finally, a game set between 1940 and 1945, which promises over 50 missions divided into historical campaigns concerning topics never seen before on our PCs such as the battle of England, that of Stalingrad, the landing in Sicily, the battle of the Bulge and finally, fatally, the fall of Berlin. Handkerchiefs aside, Wings of Prey, the latest addition to Gaijin Entertainment, finally arrives on PC. Why finally? Because the same game, albeit with a different name, has been satisfying console users for several months now, who know it as Il-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey. Compared to the original for consoles, however, the programmers have significantly enhanced both the purely technical and the simulation aspect, surrounding everything with some new multi-player options, among which the maximum number of players raised to 32 compared to the original 16 stands out. Everyone on board! Wings of Prey starts from the difficult premise of wanting to unite the most frenetic players, lovers of the arcade style, with the most experienced desk pilots, who cannot stand without hundreds of keys on different keyboards and 3 sticks. The purely graphic aspect of the title, which is the only one that unites the two types of users, passes the exam with flying colors: the aircraft models, in particular, prove to be a real feast for the eyes right from the start to reach peaks of excellence when, damaged, they show bullet-riddled wings, smoking engines and oil stains in the cockpit. Equally excellent are the special effects, complete with bullet trails, explosions and fires on board and cloud banks to obscure you from the eyes of the enemy (and vice versa). The only disappointing side, perhaps, are the details on the ground: if from above the cities appear rather interesting and massive, just as the countryside, sea and mountains seem to enjoy enviable harmony, approaching, or rushing against them, one notices that the models of the buildings are rather similar to each other, a speech that also applies to land and sea vehicles (tanks, ships, etc.). The sound effects are also decidedly successful, above all the buzzing of the engines and propellers and the bursts of machine guns, which often and willingly cover the excellent music of the soundtrack. Two weights and two measures. In arcade mode, Wings of Prey is revealed as a sort of flying shooter: with just a few keys you can have full command of the aircraft (the pad is not even mandatory) and concepts such as stalling or the number of shots/bombs to shoot become irrelevant details as the former is absent and the latter are infinite. The default view is in third person and the screen abounds with additional huds indicating not only the speed and altitude of the vehicle, but also the number of enemy aircraft in the area. A yellow arrow will indicate the direction and position of the objectives while by clicking a button we will be able to ~select~ a single target which will in turn be traced by a red arrow. The hits suffered will have no intermediate influence on the performance of your aircraft (except for the aesthetics of course) which will also be equipped with a resistance to hits worthy of a battleship. Switching to the simulation, on the other hand, you are catapulted into a first-person view from the inside, you discover that the slightest breath of wind leads to furious skidding and that even an imperceptible change in course risks a stall destined to end with a sad crash to the ground. It also turns out that there are airports from which to take off (in the arcade the mission starts already in flight) and where to return and the huds described above disappear, including target arrows: in fact, the only way to identify the targets will be to listen carefully the few and disturbed radio communications from the base camp. Just to appreciate, the damages will become a serious problem and even a few holes in a wing will seriously undermine the already precarious stability of the aircraft. However, we are still far from the level of what could be defined as a ~pure~ simulator: the lack of force feedback on the pad is felt and, at the same time, the accuracy of commands and functions of some sacred monsters of the type. Let's say that in any case it is an excellent springboard before embarking on the more precise and detail-oriented simulations, and certainly a difficult challenge for users accustomed to more arcade-style products like HAWK. The demo Curious to try Wings of Prey? Download the demo at this link, nothing could be simpler. A global warAnd. Talking about the various campaigns would be as obsessive as it is useless: Wings of Prey's over 50 missions cover the entire European front of the world war, from England to Russia, showing battles that have already been won several dozen times on land, sea, on foot or driving tanks. But what is pleasant is certainly the size of the field as well as the quantity of vehicles present: London in 1943, for example, sees about fifty German bombers and at least twenty escort fighters, surrounded by almost as many RAF interceptors, while, a few kilometers further on, a dozen German battleships besiege a well smaller English naval strength, making it necessary to destroy some enemy cruisers from above. The scenic effect is nothing short of impressive (especially the roar of the 50 bombers together) and it is admirable to note how the engine shows no signs of slowing down even in such hectic situations. On the other hand, it must be said that at the Artificial Intelligence level, a good 80% of the vehicles present on the scene (in both modes) limit themselves to ~showing up~ without actually engaging against the player or varying their plans much in case of attack, leaving the task of attempting a defense to a maximum of 3-4 fighters at a time. It must be said that this could be intentional behavior: in fact, it has never happened that entire companies have changed their flight plans to deal with a single attacker. Floating in the net The multi-player component of wings of prey does not bring anything new to its genre: 32 players and 4 different modes are in fact all that is proposed, obviously together with the over 40 aircraft models present in the game. Two of the modes are the classic Free for All team or solo modes, the third mode is instead an objective clash in which players are required to shoot down a number of enemy aircraft and / or ground targets, thus choosing with a minimum of logic such as dividing the participants between bombers and fighters, while the latter is a capture the flag where the flags are the opposing airfields. The servers are currently scarcely populated, but it is not excluded that future DLCs and the diffusion of the product could increase the number of axes of the virtual skies. The potential is certainly there.", "date": "2010-01-27", "grade": "7.9"}
