{"name": "Garden In!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/garden-in-recensione.html", "text": "There is something ontological and cosmogonic, not to say theological, in caring for a plant. Elevating oneself to an entity on which the survival of a living creature, in itself helpless and moreover unable to communicate, completely depends, actually has something divine. It is an activity in itself capable of making us reflect on the great mystery of life, death, creation, the possible existence, or insistence of course, of a superior being. Gardening, to put it in other words, can be a very profitable hobby, in the quantity and quality of the philosophical reasoning that it is able to activate and at the same time it is extremely relaxing, refreshing, satisfying to the extent that one is perfectly capable of grow and thrive your beloved plants. Unfortunately, however, the green thumb is not a quality that any superior being above has democratically distributed, in equal parts, to all the participants in this great theatrical representation commonly called life. Between those who punctually forget to feed their garden properly and those who, for totally unknown reasons, do nothing but bury one dried plant after another, it is said that not everyone can derive mental benefit from dedicating themselves to an activity that only some they can really define zen. In aid of all these missed nature lovers, of those who in spite of themselves do not have the time to properly take care of a handful of plants, or simply of those who want to drag their favorite pastime into the virtual world, the very Italian Dramatic Iceberg, software house with an operational base in Turin, it has well thought of creating Garden In!, tiny, minimalist and particular experience that could easily be compared to the dear and old Tamagotchi. Why such a comparison? We explain it to you in our review of Garden In!. Take the pot, fill the pot, cuddle the plant in the pot The house where Garden In! is set is literally suspended in the void There isn't a real menu, not worthy of the name at least, to welcome the user every time Garden In! is started. There is some writing that appears on the monitor, it is true, but in the background the center, the beating heart of the whole experience, is revealed from the beginning, or rather the room, the first among the others that can be unlocked and taken from a visual isometric, in which the experience conveyed by the software is contained. Suspended in a sidereal void that can take on the colors of sunset, sunrise, a starry sky and so on, at first you will seem to be dealing with a sort of clone of the beautiful Unpacking. Furniture reduced to the bone, boxes still to be opened piled up in bulk, the idea of being faced with a game in which time is suspended, a relaxing background music to make this placid and delicate pastel color picture even more dreamlike. A greenhouse at home? With Garden In! you will be able to create it in no time It's up to the first tutorial screen, which appears in pop-up at the center of the scene, to explain the intentions and (non) objectives of Garden In!. Starting from a convenient menu, easily recallable at the cost of a click, you can place a vase wherever you want, fill it with earth, plant a seed and wait for nature to take its course. That's all, or almost. Seriously. Really. We're not kidding. Garden In! is a rosewater simulator of indoor gardening. There is no intention of replicating reality, nor does the gameplay stumble in proposing who knows what varieties of plants, soils, pots, unknowns to take into account to prevent the value of your green thumb from being questioned. The seed is planted, one waits a few hours, virtual of course, one enjoys the view of the plant at its maximum growth and one moves on to place the next pot. Like a herbal tea before bed Every plant in Garden In! it has specific times in which it reaches maturity and preferences with whom to share its vase There are some variations on the theme to timidly revive the situation. From time to time it is advisable to water the plants, which however can at best dry out momentarily. In the event of an invasion of unwelcome insects you will have to arm yourself with sprays. In order not to make your roommates feel neglected, from time to time, you can literally pamper them with a measured and sweet caress with a click of the mouse. Furthermore, if you feel particularly adventurous, you can plant two seeds in the same pot, giving life, with a bit of luck, to new hybrid species. In terms of playful mechanics, you don't really go beyond this, leaving the tome that keeps track of all the varieties planted up to that moment, to a containedlist of unlockables and a small list of missions the task of giving a minimum of progression to the whole. Successfully planting a certain number of specimens, protecting them a certain number of times from insect attacks, discovering a new hybrid variety, are all (extremely easy) conditions imposed by the above objectives that anyone can easily achieve, especially if we consider that you will have to accumulate money, or similar credits, to buy vases in quantity or embellish the house with additional furniture and appliances. Obviously in Garden In! you can also invent interior designers, furnishing each room as you prefer Completing these small tasks will allow you to unlock new rooms, household items, backgrounds for the scenario and of course pots, seeds, types of land. Nothing so vast, of course, since on balance Garden In! it can be ~completed~ in about twenty game sessions. The only limit in this sense, in hindsight, is the time required by the plants to grow, time which, however, passes even when you are away from the PC. Precisely this peculiarity brings the creature of Dramatic Iceberg closer to the unforgettable Tamagotchi. In fact, Garden In! is the ideal software to start before going to sleep, or to take a break of about ten minutes from your stressful daily routine. Watering plants is an operation that gives an indescribable sense of satisfaction. If you are stressed, Garden In! it can help you a lot This limited amount of time, in fact, is more than enough to water the plants, change the arrangement of the furniture and maybe place a new vase somewhere. The rhythm, to be clear, is the same as that of the Tamagotchi, which required a few minutes of its time to be looked after, while for the rest of the day it could be left to its own devices. Garden In!, in short, is not a video game in the classic sense. More than anything else it offers an experience, it offers a tiny corner of paradise in which to take refuge from time to time. What it does not offer from a purely playful point of view, it returns with its pastel colors and its relaxing soundtrack capable of lulling you into an almost dreamlike dimension, where no plant can wither and there is nothing that can threaten your tranquility and calm.", "date": "2023-01-28", "grade": "7.0"}
