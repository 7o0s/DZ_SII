After making its debut on PC and mobile devices, the excellent roguelike platform created by the Japanese developer Ojiro Fumoto has also arrived on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, bringing its effective minimalist energy of 8-bit derivation to the Sony landscape. Fumoto's story as a developer certainly cannot be defined as one of the more traditional ones: after taking part in opera studies at the Tokyo University of the Arts, the boy understood that he possessed a considerable interest in game development and that he possessed some arrows at the own bow to make yourself known. By his own admission, it was works such as Braid, Super Meat Boy and Cave Story that fascinated him to the point of inducing him to experiment, using a relatively accessible platform such as Gamemaker Studio. Thus Downwell was born, partly by chance, partly out of self-sacrifice and the pursuit of a dream, managing to be appreciated for a tight gameplay, faithful to tradition but equally endowed with some distinctive characteristics. Downwell is synonymous with attention and patience, because a moment is really enough to die Throw yourself that you die! The little protagonist of Downwell must, completely recklessly, free fall into a well to try to free him from multiple threats. The mission is anything but obvious due to the particular fall control dynamics and the limited number of lives available. The only weapon that can be exploited is in fact glued to the protagonist's boots and allows him to shoot projectiles downwards after a jump or a fall. Those kinds of dynamics will look somewhat familiar to those who have already controlled Cherry Broling in Broforce. The high level of challenge and the nature of the attack techniques quickly lead to capitulation, but the random generation of each level also allows for continuous variations on the theme. This factor in some ways improves the sensations of the player and makes him perceive a slightly more nuanced level of frustration, while in others it prevents memorizing the exact location of the enemies in view of subsequent attempts, making the assignment completely different from the previous walkthrough. The game approaches can be of two types, the first involves a reasoned advance and a gradual descent, trying to eliminate as many enemies as possible and to forfeit a sufficient number of gems to spend from time to time on the purchase of life points or additional charges useful to improve the rate and frequency of fire. In this sense, the possibility of pulling off the combos allows you to obtain even higher rewards to be used in the few shops that you are lucky enough to encounter along the perilous path. The second interpretation is diametrically opposite and provides for a very fast descent, all based on quick reflexes. While proving to be successful in keeping your health bar intact and speeding up operations, it involves sacrificing any obtaining more effective weapons, such as the laser beam or the machine gun, and limiting the purchases made with gems. In addition to the upgrades that can be activated during a single stage, there are also a series of upgrades that can be chosen at the end of each level, usually from a shortlist of three alternatives. Thanks to these tools, for example, it is possible to unlock the use of a jetpack that cushions the fall when the bullets run out, or an upgrade to attract even more gems located nearby. In other cases, you can improve range and accuracy of the shots, get the support of a drone, unlock the rocket jump and much more. The game is therefore very proactive, it stimulates the player to find an imminent solution to the situations that arise in each level and to plan the next move in the most intelligent way. Playstation 4 trophies Downwell's Trophies are 23 and are mainly focused on completing all game levels, both in normal and difficult modes. There are also some tasks that require the accumulation of gems and the execution of combos. Old-fashioned minimalism From a graphic point of view Downwell is faithful to its minimalist imprinting. The game screen is limited to a narrow corridor in the center of the video, while the default color palette includes ain black on white tones, interspersed with the red color of the gems, power-ups and more fearsome enemies. The very stylized nature of the drawings and the absence of backgrounds makes the gaming experience more suitable for portable use, with the advantage that the control system guaranteed by PlayStation Vita offers greater certainties than the interface that had been adopted in the versions mobile already released previously. During the game, additional palettes can also be unlocked, which can be set as desired from the initial menu. The color variations are more than ten and also include the classic colors inspired by the Game Boy and the Virtual Boy. Moreover, many of these alternatives are quite annoying for the eyes and can sometimes make it more difficult to be able to distinguish enemies or the position of one's character, consequently we tend to prefer the settings available by default. Through the specific style selection menu it is also possible to access some variations in the movements that the protagonist performs during his descent. The choice of these new variables, unlockable with the progressive accumulation of gems, allows you to affect some specific characteristics of the character, such as the amount of maximum HP, the frequency of shops within the levels and the obtaining of some objects . Finally, the gaming system is supported by a soundtrack perfectly placed in the 8-bit context, frenetic at the right point and with a retro flavor that will undoubtedly be appreciated by those who experienced a certain type of video game on their own skin in the past .", "date": "2016-05-30", "grade": "8.5"}
