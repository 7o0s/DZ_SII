The unmistakable style of play of HoMM that remains unchanged even in Tribes of the East must not mislead by falling into easy enthusiasm: it is an interesting product only for fanatics of the saga or for those approaching it for the first time , thanks to the stand-alone nature which guarantees the presence of all the improvements made by the previous Hammers of Fate and by the numerous patches released so far. Pros Engaging and long-lived Stand-alone expansion Competitive price Cons Dated graphics Few new features The Christmas rush to the shelves has officially begun: in these hours games like Hellgate London and TimeShift have come out after months of waiting; others like Quake Wars and The Witcher have just opened the dance waiting for the grand finale with Gears of War, Crysis and Unreal Tournament III. Behind the 90 pieces follows a host of less advertised titles intended for market niches: among these, the second expansion of Heroes of Might and Magic V is certainly included, the subject of the review of these pages. It is a stand-alone expansion pack: in other words it is an expansion that does not require the original title to be installed and played. For newbies, we remind you that the glorious HoMM, initially created by New World Computing for 3DO, is one of the last exponents of the turn-based strategy genre left in circulation. With the fifth evolution, the first entrusted to Nival, also author of the subsequent evolutions (Hammers of Fate dates back to November last year), the publisher Ubisoft has attempted to rejuvenate a user who is no longer adolescent with the transition to three dimensions, a choice that has not always found positive reception from critics; at least, however, the structure of the game has remained unchanged. Among the (few) innovations introduced in Tribes of the East there is the ~unpublished~ faction called Stronghold which includes shamans, centaurs, cyclops, goblins and the like. We write unpublished in quotation marks because longtime enthusiasts will associate it with the Silvani of the fourth chapter. The peculiarity of these units is the poor aptitude for magic and the predilection for melee clashes, which are favored by the blood rage ability which makes melee troops stronger and more resistant, especially in the first minutes of the battle. A campaign for the single player was built on it which, curiously but not too much, broadly resumes the plot of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It consists of sixteen maps to be faced with three different factions: of course, more space is dedicated to that of the orcs, even if before being able to use it it is necessary to finish the first part with two other races - a choice that left us perplexed. In the opinion of the writer, however, games of this type benefit more from ad hoc created scenarios rather than from a series of levels structured to tell a story. Fortunately there is, in addition to the external editor, a random map generator that works fairly well. As we wrote a few lines above, Nival has not changed the magical alchemy of HoMM's gameplay and certainly one could not ask for much more from a simple expansion than, in terms of real novelties, as well as a second level of upgrades for the whole bestiary (which reaches almost two hundred variants), adds only the sacrificial altars where to mangle the less useful units in exchange for experience points for the hero. The usefulness of these buildings is unfortunately limited by the high level of difficulty of the game which requires maniacal preparation even for the trivial clashes with the harmless peasants. Losing even just a few men inevitably means returning to the base for reinforcements, which are regenerated every seven rounds, or every week of the game, and since there are no other ways to flesh out the ranks of one's army, it is inevitable to spend several minutes empty, while the enemy troops are advancing inexorably. To be honest this has always been one of the Achilles heels of the saga, but in Tribes of the East it takes on even more marked contours and requires continuous use of the quick load button. Having established this, the missions are based on the classic structure that provides for the annihilation of the opponents starting from a stronghold, the only source of unit production, and from a hero. Scattered throughout the levels are essential raw materials, which you will soon feel the need for, and other precious treasures with which to make your pet more powerful. Obviously guarding all this there are enemies that it is wise to face only if the computer indicates excellent chances of victory: already in moderate difficulty battlesit will be very easy to lose several units, with the unpleasant effects that we have described above. There isn't much to say about the aesthetic aspect, given that both the engine and the various polygonal models are the same as in 2006: if they had already aroused some perplexity at the time, it is natural that almost two years later they are inadequate, especially as for the special effects. We leave the easy task of judging the screenshots accompanying the article to the reader, obtained at the highest level of detail. Even the music has been largely recycled from past titles. Negative note for uploads, which in larger maps become exhausting even on medium-high-end systems. The addiction that this turn-based strategy causes remains unchanged over the years and even in this new incarnation it will be difficult to click on the button that sends you to the desktop. The desire to pass another turn is always ardent and makes us postpone the various limits of the game. For a colder and more detached analysis, however, we cannot judge Tribes of the East too positively: a real lack of innovations combined with an excessive rate of difficulty and dated graphics make it attractive only to an audience that has never approached the world fantasy created by the late New World Computing.
