Despite appearances, Hoggy 2 does not fall within the more classic platform typology, but rather in that vein of puzzle game with platform elements characterized by a particular ~density~ of elements present on the screen, which however has a strong tradition dating back to the 8 and 16 -bit. In line with this, the premise of the game is very simple: Hoggy and Hogatha are a couple of slimes who enjoy their family life happily ever after, until an army of ~Moon Men~ decides to descend to earth and kidnap the entire gelatinous offspring. Following perfectly the most classic logic of video games, the two protagonists therefore find themselves having to go through over 200 levels bristling with puzzles and various obstacles in order to recover their children, also following a minimal narrative substratum which obviously does not represent Hoggy's strong point 2 but still helps create a good characterization for the strange world of the game. In short, no particular background and psychological insights into this bizarre war declared by the aliens on the slimes are to be expected, but the start and development of the story only reinforces that pleasant feeling of being faced with an old title with a Japanese flavor of the 80s-90s, an atmosphere that represents one of the strengths of this game by Raptisoft, a team that is not new to this kind of production even beyond the first chapter of the series. It should also be noted that the title is distributed free of charge with a very fair freemium system: it is supported by the presence of non-invasive advertising, which can be completely eliminated with a single in-app purchase, making it practically a premium game. I'll stick you to the wall The vision of the virtual controls on the touch screen is always rather disturbing because it often coincides with a somewhat cumbersome gameplay, or in any case made particularly uncomfortable by the adaptation to the touch screen of the devices. However, in this case the simplicity of the control system fits well with this solution, as practically only two commands are needed: one that allows you to attach to the upper or lower surface of the various scenery parts and one that allows you to impart the direction between left and right. Practically nothing else is needed because the whole game is structured in such a way as to require the use of these two types of movement to solve puzzles and get to the end of the levels. The game mechanic requires the collection of all the fruits scattered within the schemes in order to make the keys appear that are used to open new areas to explore, and to do this it is also necessary to visit the inside of various vases and containers that they present themselves as real sub-levels, thus further expanding the game world. The possibility of acquiring new skills by assimilating power-ups or engulfing elements of the screen, a bit Kirby-style, enriches the gameplay by providing other variables to take into consideration, and the developers have worked well in building a level design that starts in a rather simple and linear and becomes more complicated and deepens as you go forward, opening up new areas and expanding the complexity of the puzzles as in a sort of real metroidvania. The weak point of Hoggy 2 are the more action-oriented phases, where greater precision and timing are required (as in boss fights) and the limits of the control system emerge quite evident. It's clearly a game that tends more towards pure reflection of the puzzle rather than speed of execution, but still manages to achieve a good balance between its two souls. Particularly apt is the introduction of a complete editor that allows you to create your own levels and share them with the community of players, which dramatically expands the longevity and game solutions by introducing a stimulating creative element, in the style of Mario Maker .", "date": "2017-08-12", "grade": "8.5"}
