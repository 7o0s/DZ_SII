However, in a world that is clearly dominated by the big triple-A titles, the development of which requires millions and millions of dollars, an indie developer must sharpen his wits for his product to gain public interest, and focus on features that are at least to some extent innovative or not very popular: the Swedish Simogo, now more than two years ago, decided to focus on her cultural roots for Year Walk, a game full of references to Scandinavian folklore and mythology, and the move was decidedly spot on. Originally released for iOS systems and then also ported to PC and Mac, Year Walk finally arrives on consoles too, Nintendo Wii U to be precise, and allows us to discover that in addition to the mythological background there is so much more that makes it a real little indie gem. Year Walk comes to Wii U with all its lore, horror, atmosphere and creativity! Discovering the future The Year Walk, rsgng in Swedish, is an ancient rite of divination particularly widespread in the south of the country until well into the 1800s and intertwined with both pagan and Christian traditions. On particular dates, especially Christmas, New Year's Eve or Saint Lucia's day, those who wanted to perform this rite remained shut up in a room all day, without speaking to anyone and without taking food or water and then, once the darkness, walk towards the village church. Here various mythical creatures, who had evidently resisted Christianity's attempts to eradicate all popular belief, would have subjected him to various tests, after which the officiant would have had visions that would have revealed his immediate future. Generally the worries were about the progress of the harvest or the health of the cattle in the following year, but for Daniel Svensson, the protagonist of Year Walk, the obsession concerns Stina, the woman he loves and who he cannot marry because she belongs to a different social class. Despite the worries of his beloved, Daniel decides to undertake the ritual, and if the premises are already decidedly original, how then everything is articulated, in terms of plot, gameplay, artistic direction and even a couple of healthy jumps on the chair, will be able to wow more than one player. At its core, Year Walk is an adventure of exploration and puzzle solving. The playing area is made up of a series of small areas connected to each other only in some specific points: if this in the original version gave it an almost labyrinthine appearance, the constant presence of the map on the GamePad screen - one of the peculiarities of the Wii U conversion control, which we'll look at in more detail in a bit - mitigates this but at the same time smooths out the experience. Another peculiarity is that, although technically we can speak of a shot in the first person, one moves in the various areas only laterally. Far from being limiting given the type of game, this feature instead allows the general atmosphere and the artistic direction to show themselves to the player in all its splendor, with a magnificent 2D that recalls the style of illustrated children's books but in a all its own, dreamlike, supernatural, a little creepy and disturbing, highly evocative with its jarring contrast between the oppressive darkness of the night and the pristine white of the snow. The smart touch screen Then when the puzzles soon arrive, the discussion must be deepened. Basically we are dealing with two different types of puzzles, the first classic, based on logic and clues, and here the thing that immediately catches the eye is that the game gives very few points of reference, or rather, those it does give are well hidden. For example, it can happen that you come across strange drawings engraved on a tree: it is understood, if you have just a minimum of experience in the genre, that they are not placed there by chance, but it is very probable that they will be useful in a very more advanced. The possibility of taking notes directly on the GamePad is very useful in this case, but the important thing is that this way of proposing puzzles only increases that feeling of dreamlike estrangement which is one of Year Walk's best features. The other typology is based on the movement: here too the resolutionit is left almost entirely to the player's imagination, and even a bit of healthy ~trial and error~, and this allows us to talk about the control system of the Wii U version, created in collaboration with Dakko Dakko. If the movements are entrusted to the canonical analog stick, with the left trigger a cursor is activated which can be maneuvered by moving the pad, and with the right trigger one begins to interact with objects, which can then always be manipulated by moving the pad. This control system, where it would have been more obvious to move the game action to the touch screen, allows the latter to host, in addition to the map and notes, also a small encyclopaedia on game folklore, a system of clues to be used in just in case you just can't go on and yet another thing that we don't anticipate, but which however is only one of the creative and surprising ways in which the pad is used from time to time. With the action unfolding smoothly on the TV and the touch screen integrated in a clever and non-obvious way, Simogo's claim that this is the ~definitive version~ of Year Walk seems very solid, it being understood that the sensors don't always work as we would like sometimes forcing ourselves to repeat the movement. This is one of only two shortcomings of the game: the other is an excessively short duration. The adventure ends quietly in one session, but it will be an intense session, especially due to the atmosphere of the whole: the source material is fascinating in itself, but it is presented in a delightful way, and if of atmosphere and art direction we have already spoken, it remains to mention the horror tone that rises slowly and in the story - which however can also be quite poignant - and in the graphic representation, without ever assuming an excessive heaviness and for this reason it is even more disturbing, omnipresent, alienating. The icing on the cake of this Wii U version is, for us inhabitants of the boot, the complete localization in Italian, absent on iOS: the little text present, however, is essential to better grasp the plot.", "date": "2015-09-24", "grade": "8.3"}
