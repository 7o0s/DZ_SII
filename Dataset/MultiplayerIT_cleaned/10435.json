The universe created by George Lucas has hosted an infinite number of adventures that have embraced every existing media and form of entertainment and over the years video games have certainly been no exception, including numerous chapters and sagas that can be enjoyed through the pad. By now the dualism between the far distant Galaxy and the videogame dimension is so consolidated that it has become unthinkable to conceive a new chapter of Star Wars without expecting the relative tie-in on our consoles and PCs. In this regard, the animated version in computer graphics The Clone Wars could certainly not be an exception, which includes a feature film and two television series. The events of Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Heroes Of The Republic are placed exactly between the two series and sees numerous excellent figures appear within it, protagonists of the various animated episodes. Jedi clones vs Sith droids Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Gli Eroi Della Repubblica presents itself as an action with a rather simple and intuitive soul, no infinite combos or particular moves to be learned over time, the skills of the characters are immediately available and remain so throughout the game . Impersonating a Jedi knight you have the opportunity to juggle with a lightsaber and thrusts of the Force, while wearing the white armor of the clone army we must assert ourselves with blaster shots making the most of the shelters by crouching. Each mission sees two heroes as protagonists on the screen at the same time, hence the marked inclination of the game towards the cooperative between two players, but even if you want to face the clashes alone, the artificial intelligence behaves just fine. The narrated events are contextualized within that gigantic intergalactic conflict known as the Clone War, where the Jedi at the head of the Republican army face the separatist threat of droids operated by the dark side of the Sith. As if to resume the rapid succession of events typical of the two film trilogies, the game missions alternate with a lively rhythm in support of a well-orchestrated background narrative and always made dynamic by the crossing of protagonists and conflict scenarios far from each other. light years that form, as the game progresses, a network that offers a clear overall picture of the developments of the war. Xbox 360 goals Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Gli Eroi Della Repubblica being a particularly simple game also makes the canonical thousand points up for grabs relatively easy to achieve, this does not mean that being able to unlock all the objectives is a short undertaking to complete Many objectives require two players to complete the game, others require certain points or medals to be achieved. However, most of the achievements are unlocked during the normal game without having to play and think too much about the gamer points up for grabs: leave it to the game and you will get a decent amount of loot in a reasonable time. A strength of points Lightsaber or rifle in hand, you proceed quickly alongside your partner through the numerous battlefields or boarded starships about to explode. The missions are quite short but their number makes the longevity of the game more than enough. Instead, what can lead to an early conclusion of the adventure is the extreme simplicity of the game that remains so until the end and there is no number of droids or end-of-level bosses that hold, Heroes of the Republic is an easy game , very easy, thanks to the fact that every death does not involve any consequence other than a sporadic loss of a tiny handful of points. In the light of this unusual immortality, therefore, there are no particular scruples in facing even the most difficult battles with a certain bravado, aware of the fact that the respawn is always close and infinite. We talked about points, which can be accumulated by keeping the multiplier high during the clashes and which can also be obtained as a reward at the end of the mission. These can be spent in the shop to buy upgrades to the characters' offensive abilities or even some fun gadgets or miscellaneous extras. The more carefree players must rest assured that finding points will never be difficult, some levels are literally full of them and for this purpose the numerous challenges scattered throughout the levels also come in handy, which will put the two players in competition in a race to see who gets the highest score, it must be said that on these occasions the partner's AI (in case you are playing alone) never represents a noteworthy challenge letting us conquer thethe primacy without too much effort. How to fight the dark side A Jedi, as we know, is a warrior full of resources, in addition to the use of his blade of light Obi Wan, Anakin and their companions have the possibility of using the thrusts of the Force to make the droids fall from the heights or to hurl some objects of the scenario against opponents. Even more interesting is the ability of each knight to momentarily take control of the droids by jumping on them so as to exploit their offensive potential against their own metal troop, in some circumstances the use of these expedients is essential to be able to continue in the levels or to clear passages apparently impracticable as the apprehensive master Yoda does not fail to repeat with his advice to the player. In the role of the clones of the Republican army, the action follows more canonical tracks: we have to rely on our trusty blaster rifle and secondary weapons such as grenades or rockets, to be collected when necessary along the way, useful for getting rid of the toughest opponents. In addition to the predominant action component that represents the soul of the game in the missions in which we are called to command the knights dedicated to the cult of the Force, it is not uncommon to face platform sections. Also in this case these are not demanding phases, the athletic qualities of the Jedi are accompanied by an assisted jump which almost always automatically catapults us onto the desired platform, saving us the effort (but also the satisfaction) of calculating the perfect take-off in the millimeter in the leaps between one overhang and another. Accidental falls are almost always attributable to perspective problems caused by the framing of the fixed camera which does not always make it possible to correctly evaluate distances. Such an extreme simplification as to mortify the gameplay itself ends up diminishing the level design which in some cases could boast at least interesting paths to face if only there was an adequate level of challenge to stimulate the player. On other occasions we are called upon to resort to the use of some means of battle, in this way the game is transformed into a classic vertical scrolling shooter without too many pretensions. Given their meager specific weight in the economy of the game, these phases represent just a, not too marked, variation on the theme. animated series? Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Gli Eroi Della Repubblica is, as we have already said, taken from the animated series The Clone Wars whose episodes boast an excellent realization in computer graphics, a peculiarity that made this spin-off well recognizable and has given a defined and unmistakable character. The game in question is directly inspired by the same guideline, taking up the features of the characters and their characterization, this time exploiting the game's polygonal engine. Unfortunately, the result is far from the pleasant effect seen in the cinema and on TV, the polygonal load, even in the case of the protagonists, is insufficient and betrays a cheap modeling that clashes with the memory of the models taken as a reference. Even the textures show the side to a really annoying low definition, especially when you go to analyze the game environment: meager and too often anonymous. To this we add the presence of a slight aliasing and some sporadic drops in frame rate during the most chaotic fights despite the fact that the scene never shines with such graphic detail as to justify a weighting of the hardware. On the other hand, the audio is excellent, on the other hand Sta Wars has always delighted our hearing with exceptional soundtracks, but this time the task of accompanying the unsheathing of lightsabers is not up to dear old John Williams, but to the talented Kevin Kiner , curator of the soundtrack of the animated series.", "date": "2009-10-26", "grade": "5.3"}
