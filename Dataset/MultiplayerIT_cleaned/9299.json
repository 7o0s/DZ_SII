There's no getting around it. The Microsoft Points required for this Escalation Pack are many, 1200, for four multiplayer maps plus a zombie, and this has written and will write millions of characters in forums around the world, equally divided between fanboys and haters. Nothing matters to us, or rather the cost obviously has its weight in the evaluation, but for now it is better to stop and examine the new package. Treyarch, as for First Strike, has not limited itself to doing its homework, but has put its effort into creating various and articulated maps, each with a peculiarity, and above all capable of enhancing all types of players, stormtroopers or campers who they are. This time the American boys have not placed the emphasis on the interactivity of the maps, however present, to concentrate instead on the usual, amazing, level design. Seas and mountains The new arenas are all characterized by a decisive work of multiplying the various passage points towards the larger spaces, and they are all quite large. Hotel, the map set in Cuba, sees the two teams challenge each other on the roof of a huge resort divided into two buildings located at the ends, the sense of deja vu of the old Highrise map of Modern Warfare 2 would seem to be strong, however everything is complicated by a maze of different rooms and environments, which build very varied game situations. In short, there are not only two empty ~large rooms~ at the ends of the roof, but in the two wings of the hotel we find offices, casinos, concert halls, balconies and offices, and as if that were not enough, in the central esplanade there is also a beautiful swimming pool complete with changing rooms to make the map more labyrinthine. It goes without saying that close quarter combat is privileged here, but a couple of elevated areas guarantee wild sniping for all 10x optics aficionados. In terms of interactivity, the elevators that lead to the highest areas of the buildings guarantee claymore ambushes. The characterization of the map is decidedly appreciable on a visual level, with well-constructed environments (especially those indoors) and rich in detail. From the Cuban heat we move on to the snowy Soviet village of Stockpile, a rather ~classic~ map, which revolves around a fortress garage where it is possible to open and close the access shutters. Here too there is a good alternation between outdoor and indoor spaces, i.e. small huts, and as per the tradition of these packages, it is quite intricate. It is certainly not the best of the lot, or rather the one that remains the most impressed, but it should be emphasized that it is in any case a decidedly well-made map and suitable for everyone, perhaps not particularly developed vertically, but full of shelters, secluded points and alternative passages. Xbox 360 goals The Escalation Pack offers five achievements, for a total of 150 points, all related to the Call of the Dead zombie mode. They are obtained by exploiting the weapons available, such as the new V-R11, or by obscuring the ~final~ boss. On a trip with CoD We remain beyond the curtain with Zoo, the most visually exuberant arena of this Escalation Pack, which allows us to fight inside a ruined zoo. It is not simply a question of zigzagging between the empty cages, those who drew the map enjoyed imagining the zoo as a real amusement park, with dozens of shops, terraces, aquarium caves, stairways, bars and even an elevated monorail to enjoy the right sniper eye shot. It is a rather large map, but, thanks to the many narrow streets, the different passages, visible and not, that cut it, you often find yourself in the strait, with many blind corners and sheltered positions. Of the package it is the least immediate and which will make the novices see the green mice, but once it has been adopted there is a good chance that it will become the favor of the package. Here too, as for the Hotel, the excellent stylistic work and characterization of the environments should be noted. We return to the West with Convoy, another map with a decidedly inspired design, set somewhere in California, during an ambush on a military convoy. Similarly to the Casino the arena is divided into two distinct and separate parts at the ends of which the more open spaces are found, where we also find from two elevated areas from which one can easily target the path of the attack, which even reveals a beautiful crater that takes us directly to an underground connection area. On the sides of the whole we find buildings, structures and restaurants, cluttered streets and secondary passages. The leitmotiv of the package was therefore respected, lots of diversificationto make the map attractive to all types of players, and the usual skill in surrounding the ~zones of interest~ of many access points to never get bored with bottlenecks and bottlenecks. We close with the highlight of this Escalation Pack, namely Call of the Dead, the new zombie map that takes us to Antarctica, together with four veterans of horror cinema, namely Sarah Michelle Gellar, better known as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Robert ~Freddy Krueger~ Englund, Danny Trejo, the Mexican character actor, now in the cinema with Machete, protg of Robert Rodriguez and Michael Rooker, dear Henry Blood Rain, villain of a thousand B-movies and recently seen in The Walking Dead, all directed by His Majesty George Romero, the father of all zombie movies. The film set will soon leave room for the usual waves of undead, with our George as a mentor who will become a real boss who will electrocute us for the duration of the game with a set light. New weapons and perks are available, such as the V-R11 that transforms zombies into men, and DeadShot Daiquiri, useful for obtaining increased aim. The map is quite vast and articulated, in short, cooperation is required as never before.", "date": "2011-05-06", "grade": "8.0"}
