{"name": "Partenza bruciante!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/93311-f1-2011-partenza-bruciante.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360They are their own words. ~We want F1 to become an annual brand like FIFA,~ Steven Hood, the game's lead designer, said in an interview last year. And so it was. As for the Electronic Arts football simulation, the guys started from the excellent foundations of the previous edition, but above all from the substantial corrective patch and user feedback to put on track a product that represents a big step forward, with many corrections, adjustments and various new game modes. It is simply enough to say that the safety car has finally been implemented (present in the races with over 20% of the total laps) and that, to tell the truth already fixed during construction last year, there will no longer be stops without end while waiting for one's turn to exit the pits. There is obviously much more, but more generally it is possible to say without a shadow of a doubt that the English guys have worked well, not just resting on their laurels, probably creating the title they would have liked to publish in 2010. Enemies at home What's new? The mechanism of the Career has remained unchanged, we start with a low-profile team to try to climb the world championship and the top teams, achieving objectives race by race, challenging your teammate and answering questions from the press. All played out in an immersive and realistic perspective of the seasons, given that whatever one says and does has an impact on the development of the car and on one's reputation from a driver's market perspective. The mechanism works, especially in the first few seasons when we sweat in the back rows and give us further stimuli to move forward, limiting the times in practice and giving it our all in the race in the team's internal challenge. The same problem already seen twelve months ago returns here too, i.e. that the interviewer's questions tend to repeat themselves: they certainly don't ask the multiple choice dialogues of Mass Effect for heaven's sake, but also wanting to be cheeky with the press and not very honest with the technicians, if the race objectives have been achieved, there does not seem to be a strong impact of our sentences on the continuation of the season. It will not be a fundamental feature capable of changing the gameplay in depth, but it certainly achieves the aim of making the staging of the circus even more realistic and television. Once the career years are over, a range of possibilities open up, both online and in single player. Alone, it is possible to devote ourselves to dry grand prix and challenge the stopwatch, or to the ~Controtempo~, which offers real scenarios in which to race according to pre-established conditions, such as weather, tires and obviously the car and track, trying to win the gold. In short, a nice way to put ourselves to the test and not just a simple extra to lengthen the duration of the game when you cannot access the network. Still on the side of the news, we can now dedicate ourselves to the Career (or to the individual grand prix) in two on the same console via split screen. Once online in the real competitive part, the grid will be complete with sixteen players ready to compete and eight managed by the CPU. While brand new in this version we find the Online Career, with all the annexes and connected, playable in two as teammates, obviously with a separate save compared to the single player one. It goes without saying that such a mode will trigger all kinds of situations seen last year at Red Bull, with the drivers who will compete not only for points but also for the development of the car, with the CPU indicating who is the first guide depending on their performance. In short, breakups of ten-year friendships are expected in view of unpleasant team games. Guide scalability The Career is fine, the scenarios and the local and online cooperative are fine, but once behind the wheel, how is the feeling of the single-seater? During the previous meetings with the developers and during the preview, many words were spent on the improvement of artificial intelligence, on a greater importance of the damages, not only derived from accidents, and more generally on a greater sense of likelihood of the race . Our review confirms Codemasters' intentions, the work done in this sense is undoubtedly good, all inserted in a driving model which, thanks to the many settings available, goes from being easy and immediate (but never too arcadey) with all the aids activated are quite demanding and more than punishing if you decide to rely only on your handle. The developers have been good at creating truly scalable handling, in short, it is enough to lower the traction control a notch to immediately notice important changes atthe steering wheel, which force us to rethink our driving style, without, however, an abrupt increase in the learning curve. Playing with the settings and with the level of difficulty (four available) allows us to better configure our gaming experience, just don't abuse it since the (inter)average challenge rate is certainly not a stumbling block and if chosen together with the activated aids can make F1 2011 all too easy in some situations, with opponents like Massa, ie slow and not very accustomed to overtaking. Our advice is to start as a Professional and turn the aids on or off as needed. In short, everything like last year. There is distinctly greater attention to the reproduction of bumps and the different types of grip of the tracks. The cars jolt and break up, and if you decide to play without help curbs and small excursions become our sworn enemies, also because you have to completely forget the brutal openings after braking on pain of big twists, with consequent losses of precious seconds and risk of accidents if in full battle or at the start (therefore the replays at our disposal are useful, up to a maximum of four). From this point of view, as previously written, F1 2011 becomes a tough and demanding title, which requires some practice and not a cheerful Sunday outing guide with his arm out the window. Does this mean that we are dealing with an all-round simulation? The pedigree of Paul Jeal, Senior Producer of the title, sees a masterpiece like GP Legends among his past works and this is already a good indication of the developers' approach. Our feeling is that there are obviously compromises, the console user is so vast and heterogeneous that it is impossible to make a drastic choice both in one direction and in the other, but the extreme scalability of the title allows everyone to enjoy F1 2011 in the best possible way. Weight problems In online matches it is evident that those who play with aids are certainly a step above those who decide to take to the track without them. Codemasters has implemented a system in which whoever activates the aids, depending on the rank achieved (there are also objectives here), will ~enjoy~ an increased weight which will penalize the car compared to the others. This is so that the more experienced players are not too advantaged, especially in the wet, consequently populating the upper parts of the rankings with both small Vettels and naive Karthikeyans, and obviously to push players to try the title at the top of the driving model without assistance. Nice breakups! The damage model, and the various contingencies of the race help reinforce this feeling. Last year's incidents felt like they were undersized to avoid frustration, especially on grands prix played in their entirety. Now the situation has certainly improved, the ~catastrophic~ crashes (and by catastrophic we don't mean rollovers and fronts, but rather broken front fairings, suspensions and punctures) are more frequent and force us to return to the pits for the necessary repairs. At the same time, however, the dividing line between important and light damage is not very clear, and when the CPU signals that something is wrong, the machine is not unbalanced as it should, continuing to run as if nothing had happened. Steps forward in this sector, but not as incisive as we would have expected. On the other hand, the implementation of a ~loss of performance~ system depending on our driving style was apt. The cleaner this is, the better the car will run, the more aggressive, dirty it will be and without regard for the engine and all the other mechanical parts, the sooner it will wear out with important long-term consequences. And still on the likelihood front, it's nice to note how Kers and mobile wing (be careful, never activate it when cornering!) are not always available. As we see on television, they often tend not to work, and only after a few laps will our engineer tell us if the problem has been solved. The artificial intelligence is good, more ~devilish~ than in the past, provided of course not to go too far with the level of difficulty. In front they battle each other, even making mistakes with a certain frequency, and when they are behind us, if they can't use Kers and DRS (the mobile wing) we will often see them try to dare like real daredevils, trying to slip even into the tightest curves. Pay attention to your trajectory though. In various situations we have been penalised, with the judges giving us a nice illegal block, because even though we didn't see the opponent alongside us (at most a fleeting appearance of the nose as if it were a glitch) we squeezed him, throwing him out. In this case, the directional arrows thatthey warn us of the position of the other drivers and the mirrors aren't enough, when you're in full battle it's better to lift your foot if you have the quick reflexes to do so, and try a nice counter-overtaking. Ultimately, more than the scalable driving model, the improved but not too much damage and aggressive artificial intelligence, what makes F1 2011 really close to reality is the atmosphere of the race weekend. If you decide to ~manualize~ everything, including race strategies, breakdowns, dynamic weather, tire wear - to bring up to temperature for better grip - and petrol, inflexible race judges, Kers and DRS breaking down and (finally) the safety car, the Codemasters title immerses us fully in the Circus with great effectiveness. Xbox 360 goals F1 2011 rewards the player with 38 achievements for a total of 1000 points. The majority of achievements are unlocked by simply playing and career progression both online and locally, while the more difficult ones are achieved with special conditions, such as lapping six cars in a race, winning 9 races in a row, winning Monte Carlo with the damage activated after hitting a wall, or lapping in five successive laps with times around a quarter of a second apart. It's raining as usual Technically speaking, there are no very evident improvements compared to the past year, here too we are talking about evolution and not about a distortion of a really well made product. The frame rate is always the same, anchored to thirty frames per second albeit with sporadic slowdowns. The cars are polygonally rich, with detailed textures with good, but not exceptional, work on refractions. On the other hand, all the effort put into the elements on the track has a certain weight, the restyling work of the circuits is important, with even the addition of entire architectural elements that were missing last year, with certainly more than enough detail. However, the game is not free from small criticisms, venial peccadilloes we could say, but present. We cannot fail to mention obviously not too detailed textures and at a lower than average resolution in the pit scenes, both of the drivers and the mechanics. Nothing transcendental is understood, but the detachment is evident with everything else. As usual, the Ego graphics engine shines when it comes to staging small showers or real storms. We all know what rain means in F1, or rather the eternal ballet between intermediate and wet tires and the loss of grip even on the straight. To complicate everything, as anyone who has played the previous version knows, there is the credible and terrible effect of the water raised by the car that precedes us and which practically makes us blind. As beautiful to see as scary to suffer. On the audio side, it should be noted the useful invasiveness of the engineer via radio, certainly much higher than last year. It tells us everything we need to know, it doesn't just tell us to push harder. It informs us about the other riders, who enters and who leaves the pits, what tires they are on, the race pace, the condition of the brakes and tyres, or presumed breakages. In short, also from this point of view the immersive factor is total. Of course, sometimes he comes out with opponents on his heels when instead they are several seconds behind, small mistakes perhaps dictated by the stress of the race.", "date": "2011-09-16", "grade": "9.0"}
