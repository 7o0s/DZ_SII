{"name": "Zen Pinball Party", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zen-pinball-party-recensione.html", "text": "We really needed a good pinball game on Apple Arcade, if only to give a sense of completeness to the name of the service and in honor of the old arcades. So it is with great momentum that we have approached this review of Zen Pinball Party. With equal satisfaction, we can also say that it is one of the best interpretations of the pinball machine that we have seen in the long series, capable not only of best transposing the tradition of Zen Studio simulations into the mobile environment, but also of evolving it and perhaps finding a new of the best possible locations. It is, once again, a digital replica of the classic pinball machine, with some enrichments possible only thanks to the use of the possibilities offered by the transposition into a video game, at least on the more recent tables, but which finds in this case one of the best possible platforms, both for its excellent location within Apple Arcade and for its perfect use on Apple's mobile devices. The gameplay is exactly the same as in the other chapters and is what you would expect from a pinball simulation, i.e. throw a metal ball on various inclined tables and try to keep it in play by relaunching it with the paddles, making sure it doesn't fall into the hole placed between them. In essence, it is the same game that continues unchanged from the early 1950s to today, but transported digitally and with some additional additions such as different modes and a certain sense of progression which helps to give the whole thing a more complete ~videogame form~. , amalgamating the individual matches into a single and continuous experience. Zen Pinball Party seems to find a perfect place within Apple Arcade, offering an experience that is always ready for use in the large catalog of the service and also avoiding the problem of breaking up content behind paywalls and DLCs. Many tables, a single progression The new tables, created by Zen Studios, have deeper graphic elaborations Zen Studios has a very long tradition of pinball games, the beginning of which can be traced back to 2007 with the old Pinball FX for Xbox 360 on Live Arcade, then continuing with the new name in various other chapters over the years. Zen Pinball Party looks a bit like the summation of the experience of the series, gained by more than a decade of evolutions and new tables added to the catalogue. Most of these, taken from the most recent iterations of the franchise, are also proposed within the large catalog of this chapter, but several are new, divided into various categories and with additional unlockable models as you progress through the game. The initial endowment is 12 tables, with others expected to arrive later even if there is still no precise information in this regard. In any case, the initial catalog is still quite rich and varied, including 4 tables inspired by animated films (My Little Pony, How to Train Your Dragon, Trolls and Kung-Fu Panda), 4 created by Zen Studios and 4 reproduced from original Williams games, plus three additional ~LED mini-games~ to unlock. Among the Zen Pinball Party tables there is also one on My Little Pony The points accumulated in every single game and the stars obtained on the basis of these on every single table lead to the conquest of various rewards, which concern the unlocking of mini-games or the customization of the interface, thus making every single session an integral part of the general progression. Among the game modes, in addition to the single player, there is also a competition against other players based on the score and online tournaments, on a weekly basis, focused on particular pinball machines and with special rewards, thus varying the action between matches. Like a real game room In certain situations, the shot moves closer to illustrate some details of the tables The construction of the tables is quite complex, but always functional to keep the game as fluid and dynamic as possible. While the machines inspired by licensed films and those designed by Zen take advantage of more dynamic framing and advanced effects, the Williams originals are practically perfect reproductions of real mechanical tables, perhaps the purest expression of pinball simulation, rather devoid of exaggerations and excessive mobile elements which, in some cases, weigh down the action in modern tables a little. While waiting to understand when and how the pinball catalog will be updated in the future, this first selection is still interesting, even if obviously hopes it will be enriched soon, possibly without having to incur additional disbursements (but the presence within Apple Arcade should guarantee a certainsafe, from this point of view). The quality of the individual tables fluctuates a bit, but in general it remains at an excellent level. The thing that is most striking, from a technical point of view, is the physical simulation of the ball which is always very convincing and responds realistically to stimuli, including the pushes that are obviously present, as befits a real simulation.", "date": "2021-09-08", "grade": "8.0"}
