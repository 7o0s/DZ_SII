The control system is very simple and well suited to the mouse / keyboard combination, even if a joypad remains the best choice to play at its best. Dynasty Warriors 4, beyond its various contents, is nothing more than a fighting game. The series (a 4 in front of the name will mean something) has made real fiascos, in the land of the rising sun, where it has sold millions of copies, establishing itself as one of the most successful sagas for PS2. Converting the game to PC, two years after its release on mother Sony's console, can be considered a gamble... but the promises made by Koei, Every now and then cutscenes will break the action by showing us some important events. concerning above all the updating of the technical sector, they boded well. If you don't know what we're talking about, here's a quick description of the game: as already mentioned, Dynasty Warriors 4 is basically a fighting game set on some of the most famous battlefields in the history of Japan. Its peculiarity is that of presenting pitched battles against dozens of enemies at the same time, which must be wiped out with various combos and super moves. As you can see from the screenshots scattered throughout the article, there is often a real overcrowding of troops on the screen, trading blows to each other. Obviously most of the enemies are standard types (archers and warriors are the most common) and go down with a few hits. Among these, however, there are some stronger warriors (marked on the general map of the level with red placeholders in the shape of a Tetris piece) who, if eliminated, give power ups of various kinds (attack, defense, special items and more) and with which, in some cases, it will be possible to engage in real one-on-one duels. In each level there will be a target super enemy to reach (usually the commander of the rival army) who, once eliminated, will end the battle. If you wish, you can also avoid fighting us (just close all the doors to see him escape), the important thing is to emerge victorious from the fight. Dynasty Warriors 4 is essentially a fighting game set on some of the most famous battlefields in Japanese history When the technique doesn't help The most important feature of Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper simultaneously represents its biggest limitation. The desire to represent an entire theater of war at the same time clashes with a realization that leaves a bad taste in the mouth, especially when one realizes that the vaunted improvements of the PC version represent, however, the most obvious limit. Let's take for example the possibility of expanding the point of view so as to make a good part of the fog that covered the scenarios on the Sony console disappear. Beautiful, one thinks, finally the view is no longer limited due to technical problems and you can observe everything that actually appears in front of you up to the horizon. Unfortunately, along with a good part of the map, the elimination of the fog also makes another not very pleasant little thing evident: the immobile troops who sit around doing nothing waiting for some opponent to pass by them. Between ourselves it is not exactly immersive to observe enemies who are sitting on their hands while a furious fight is taking place a few meters away, it makes you want to call them into the fray. With the fog it could have worked better, because the opponents were invisible (the eye cannot see, the heart does not ache... popular wisdom comes to our rescue) and the fact that they were positioned at a short distance could easily be ignored. On PC they can be seen, and very well too (unless you want to play with the fog activated... but I don't think you're that masochistic), so the trick doesn't work and you immediately realize the fiction and how the famous field of virtual battle: it is absolutely static and there is no real battle except for a few scattered skirmishes here and there.[C] Against some enemies you can compete in real duels. Come on guys, my sword feels like cutting something! War always forces you to make difficult choices. [/C] The technical improvements, moreover, have not been implemented very well. The graphics of the PC version is certainly better than the PS2 one but it pays the price of a really poor fluidity (especially by activating the dynamic shadows) and of not being, in any case, certainly at the top. In short, the computer on which the game was tested (P4 3.4 GHz, 2 GB of RAM, GeForce 7800 GT) is not exactly a High End but manages to run smoothlyF.E.A.R. and Quake 4 (just to name two) with all effects activated. Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper on the other hand, set to maximum, goes up and down at 4, 5 frames per second. One wonders, actually, what PC is needed to make it go well also by virtue of the fact that there are who knows what visual miracles to show. There is good in his heart Having said this, it is undeniable that, once the game has been set up so that it runs smoothly on its configuration and once the presence of motionless puppets just waiting to be beaten by us has been digested, we are faced with a title that manages to entertain despite everything (after all, massacring dozens of enemies with a single combo always makes a scene and makes life beautiful), especially if you don't develop any pretension of depth and let yourself be carried away by the immediate and very light game dynamics. Longevity is guaranteed by the 4 modes present and by the possibility of using different characters (as well as that of completely changing factions by reversing the point of view). The game is localized in Italian, even if not all elements have been translated and overall the adaptation can be considered hasty and careless. The corner of the requirement Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper was tested on a 3.4 GHz P4 with 2 GB of RAM and a GeForce 7800 GT video card with 256 MB. As already specified in the article, fluidity problems were encountered (especially by activating the dynamic shadows) which forced us to do various tests with the settings before being able to play decently. The recommended minimum requirements are as follows: a 1.6 GHz Pentium 4 processor or higher, 256 MB of RAM, 2.4 GB of free hard disk space, and a 64 MB DirectX 8.0 compatible video card, but we cannot guarantee that you will have satisfactory results. Instead, we think it's better to get at least 2.4 GHz, 512 MB of RAM and have a fifth generation GeForce or ATI. Final comment Dynasty Warriors 4 is a controversial game. On the one hand, it is nice to see such an important title converted for PC, on the other, a bitter taste remains in the mouth for the overall realization and for the actual improvements that could have been made to the game without too much effort. The end result is just enough, also by virtue of the extremely competitive price at which the game is sold. Pros Fighting against dozens of enemies at the same time is fun Good longevity Good combat system Cons Technically poor Not very high fluidity Little variety History Do you know the history? The one with a capital ~s~ that is studied in schools? But yeah, come on, you know her. Even if during school hours you spend your time sending messages to each other on your cell phone and grunting under the desk, you should still have understood, even if subliminally, high-sounding names such as those of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, or well-known events such as the Punic Wars and the battle of Waterloo. In our schools, unfortunately, oriental history is not studied much. Unfortunately, I say not so much because it is particularly more interesting than ours, but simply because by studying it we will have clear that it works more or less like it does for us: some famous names, some battles to be handed down to posterity and a lot of historical literature that tends to mythologize men which had very little mythical. In short, not only we are good at transforming cruelty and mediocrity into heroism and massacres into epic events.

Family tragedies, changes of dynasties, betrayals, epic clashes. Do we need a lot of noise to justify our desire to see a little blood flow on the monitor? Yes.", "date": "2006-03-08", "grade": null}
