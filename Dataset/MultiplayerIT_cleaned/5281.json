What happens next, however, is told by Oz: Broken Kingdom, the new mobile game developed by This Game Studio and produced by Nexon for iOS and Android devices. Presented during the last Apple conference due to some features related to the characteristics of the iPhone 7, the game offers a long single player campaign in which, in the role of the protagonist Ophelia Shen or the aforementioned Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion, we will have to face hordes of opponents from the point of view of an RPG-style turn-based combat system. Added to this is the possibility of fighting in the arena against human opponents, in real time, carrying on the growth of a second team, made up not only of heroes but also of monsters and creatures belonging to the Oz universe. The role-playing facets of the title find expression in the skill management system of each character, with a set of upgradeable cards that allow you to launch powerful attacks, restore your energy, activate a shield against enemy blows and so on. Oz: Broken Kingdom is a really interesting title from the point of view of design and ~lore~ Other than shoes The thickness of Oz: Broken Kingdom lies in the management phase, in the selection of skills and in their enhancement, because from the gameplay point of view the game turns out to be quite simple and linear, unable to emphasize the strategic aspect of the fights. Assuming that the red power (armor) prevails over the green one (speed), that the green one prevails over the yellow one (strength), that the yellow one prevails over the blue one (magic) and that finally the blue power prevails over the red one, you have to select each time the hero suitable for the fight on the basis of the composition of the opposing horde, then try your hand at a turn-based system that signals the order of moves on the right side of the screen. When our character has two turns in a row, we can perhaps use the first to restore some energy and the second to carry out an attack, choosing the target and continuing to hammer it until we eliminate it, thus reducing the space in which to force of circumstances we suffer damage. Each card consumes a certain amount of mana, which can be recharged during the fight, and it is clear that the most powerful ones are also the most demanding in terms of spiritual energy, up to a special maneuver capable of causing a lot of damage to enemies. The freemium aspect of the experience already stands out in the transition to the second zone and requires a minimum of grinding in order to be competitive, but the further you go on in the campaign, the more this factor becomes decisive, as often happens. Of course, it must be said that from a technical and artistic point of view, the work done by This Game Studio is commendable: the design of the characters is excellent, there are evolutions of the same and even the enemies are beautiful to look at and fairly varied. The realization of the scenarios is less brilliant, which remain mostly the same unless you change location. Finally, the sound sector is excellent, thanks above all to full-bodied and convincing effects, which make the impacts and the emphasis of the clashes well.", "date": "2016-09-23", "grade": "7.5"}
