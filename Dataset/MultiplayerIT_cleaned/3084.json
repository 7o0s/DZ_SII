{"name": "Dino Squad", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dino-squad-recensione.html", "text": "The Dino Squad review brings to mind the now quite numerous games starring dinosaurs, in this case armed and armored, engaged in challenging each other in a territorial multiplayer mode in which you have to conquer and defend towers to score a score higher than the opposing team. It is practically the same formula that we experimented exactly a year ago with Full Metal Monsters, and which in many respects is inspired by an 80s television series, Dino-Riders, from which a toy line also successfully distributed in Italy, remained in the hearts of nostalgics. In fact, we are talking about a theme that cannot fail to excite, especially when the charm of enormous and lethal creatures such as dinosaurs are combined with gaudy armour, futuristic weapons and special abilities. If we then add a good technical sector to this mix , a gameplay capable of withstanding six-on-six clashes with lightning-fast matchmaking (but sometimes suspicious: how many bots are there on the servers?) and the gratuity of the freemium model, declined in a not too invasive way despite its inevitable microtransactions, the potential is undoubted. Gameplay Dino Squad absolutely does not get lost in chatter, to the point that this tutorial is optional and must be referred to specifically. This means that once the game has started we will be able to immediately jump into the middle of a battle, choosing one of the three dinosaurs initially available and starting to collect experience points to be able to upgrade it, unlock new skills and possibly new weapons; although the latter are generally protected by a paywall which implies the disbursement of hard currency, given with a certain parsimony but obviously obtainable by putting a hand in the wallet. Once you take the field, the goal is to conquer and maintain control of a series of towers, with some new facet represented by the need to destroy the panels if they are managed by the opposing team, before being able to recover them. The touch controls are a mix between the best layouts for the shooter genre and the more traditional ones, with the odious manual focus: an excessively cumbersome solution, unless you have two right thumbs, which requires you to leave the control of the camera to be able to shoot. Here, in this case on the right side of the screen there are two virtual sticks: the first, invisible, only adjusts the view, while the second activates fire and can be used when we are in proximity to a target, starting from the assumption that fortunately the ammunition of our weapons is always infinite. A semi-automatic lock-on system makes it much easier to score shots, even if this mechanism ends up unbalancing the experience a bit, especially where certain units are used. The system is therefore saved in the corner, giving us good precision and good reactivity, but focusing above all on the different characteristics and equipment of each selectable dinosaur. As mentioned, initially we will be able to count on three types of creature: Reaver, fast and elusive but frail , armed with a shotgun, ideal for conquering points of interest and falling back; Primarch, a rather slow but resistant tank and equipped with a machine gun that deals moderate damage; and Archon, a relatively level-headed sniper. It is possible to change the dinosaur at each respawn, but above all to enhance our roster from game to game, possibly using score multipliers linked to watching short advertising trailers. Technical realization Dino Squad includes six different scenarios, fairly large but characterized by often generic solutions, especially as regards textures. The dinosaurs are different, as they appear well made, with their specific equipment, and have a good set of animations: the roster has a total of seventeen specimens, so it's quite rich. The interface is functional, with a mini map at the top right and very few icons crowding the screen, which can therefore be entirely dedicated to the in-game action. On iPad Pro the experience always remains fluid and well-defined, without uncertainties, but as mentioned the great speed of matchmaking and some situations that are a little too linear suggest the presence of bots on the servers: it is difficult to understand how things really are.", "date": "2020-05-20", "grade": "7.8"}
