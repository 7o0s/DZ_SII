{"name": "Angeli e demoni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/127829-archangel-angeli-e-demoni.html", "text": "Where the battlefield is that of Diablo-style action RPGs, the clash on mobile devices appears ferocious and with no holds barred. On the one hand we have the extraordinary quality of Dungeon Hunter 4 which is however affected by a particularly incorrect and invasive freemium system, on the other the ~collected~ but spectacular and convincing dynamics of Eternity Warriors 3; in between, here is the debut of the interesting Archangel, with its RTS-style approach, a high-impact technical sector and a narrative background halfway between religion and fantasy, in which we play the role of an archangel who awakens after a sleep lasted millennia to restore order within a dark and menacing kingdom, now controlled by the forces of evil. The expedient of hibernation is used by the Black Tower Studios guys to justify the gradual acquisition of new skills by the protagonist, who at first can only hit his enemies with balls of fire, but who soon becomes capable of defeating them using a shield charge, build walls of flame and even resurrect your opponents to obey your commands. Archangel is nice to look at and varied enough, but the RTS controls and level design don't mix My name is Legion There is no real story behind Archangel, so don't expect dialogue and cinematics along the lines of Darksiders. Simply, the divine warrior we control awakens and begins to fight, with the aim of cleaning up a series of stages from the infernal creatures that inhabit them, moving along rather intricate corridors, stairs and clearings, which unfortunately do not agree in the slightest with the control system adopted for the occasion. In fact, using the touch screen, we are asked to touch areas of the map for the archangel to move in that direction, as said in RTS style, and in the same way to touch enemies to hit them. The special maneuvers are activated through the composition of simple gestures, which however are often misunderstood by the game: the ~strip~ that allows us to start with the shield charge is, for example, called instead of the input we wanted to express, i.e. the creation of a wall of fire, accidentally making us come into contact with the group of demons we wanted to distance ourselves from. The presence of different objectives from level to level, in this case the exploration of the map to eliminate all opponents or a wave resistance challenge, and the possibility of buying new equipment between missions succeed in avoiding a repetitiveness which however is inherent in the connotation of the locations. The latter are in fact too similar to each other, so much so that after a while they get bored and often show some bugs, with enemies who, for example, pass through low walls to reach us, animated by a passion that reveals an artificial intelligence of low profile, as sometimes you can kill them with a ranged charge attack without them even noticing your presence. In short, the ideas from which Archangel starts and the way in which they are visually represented are all convincing factors about the goodness of the project, which however slams against a wall made of repetitiveness, imprecise controls and an intricate level design that immediately proves to be inadequate to the RTS approach.", "date": "2014-01-27", "grade": "6.5"}
