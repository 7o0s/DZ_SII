{"name": "Yakuza 3 per PS4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-3-ps4-recensione.html", "text": "Yakuza 3 landed in the West by surprise, with the sudden launch of The Yakuza Remaster Collection during Gamescom 2019, and for this review we therefore had to roll up our sleeves and immerse ourselves as quickly as possible in the facets of a production originally published ten years ago, which unfortunately feels the full weight of the time that has passed so far. Not as far as history and direction are concerned, however: those elements are not afraid of obsolescence and are confirmed as solid in this case too, picking up the events exactly where we left them at the end of Yakuza Kiwami 2. Determined to give up life as a Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu decides to leave for Okinawa with little Haruka and manage together the Sunflower orphanage where he himself grew up. The initial stages of the story use narrative devices that aim to deceive the viewer, representing situations that are only apparently connected to each other: an appreciable and relatively original solution for the franchise, which however brings themes to which we are well accustomed to the screen. In fact, it happens that the land on which the orphanage stands is at the center of a dispute between politicians and entrepreneurs: the former want to use it to build a resort that can significantly boost tourism in the area, while the latter intend to expand the bases military. In the middle there is of course the Dragon of Dojima, who will certainly not abandon his orphans. Scenarios and technical implementation Net of the setting of the Sunflower orphanage, quite limited, the events of Yakuza 3 basically take place between Okinawa and Tokyo, in the latter case in the traditional fictitious district of Kamurocho. We find it in the first of the twelve chapters that make up the campaign and then later, when events force Kazuma to ~return home~ to resolve the matter and deal with a sudden and mysterious attack on the Tojo clan. It is clear, it is a rough version of the scenario that we rediscovered with Yakuza 0 (in that case brought back to the charm of the 80s) and then with the two Kiwami, so the initial impact is not the best. The streets of the city appear empty despite the fact that there are several NPCs walking around (many of them inexplicably hunchbacked), the effects are what they are and the general interaction is limited, with even short loads accompanying access to any building or activity commercial. In short, after having experienced the best version of Kamurocho ever very recently, with the spin-off Judgment, it is not very pleasant to go back so far in the past. However, it is an interesting experience for Yakuza fans, especially those who ten years ago did not play with the third chapter, for one reason or another, and can therefore recover it now, enjoying, as said, a narrative that is confirmed at the top. The second scenario, an area of Okinawa, unfortunately does not raise the qualitative level: we are talking about a fairly small neighborhood, with some fascinating glimpses (see the typical shopping arcades, dotted with shops of various kinds) but, in general, little to offer in the concrete. In short, from a technical point of view, Yakuza 3 does not benefit greatly from the remastering work: even at the time the game had somewhat dated graphics, and with the upscaling the developers did not change the geometry and polygon count. This means that we will find a more blocky Kazuma than usual, characters with ~big hands~, very little sophisticated animations and also a very poor sound design, with various effects that leave something to be desired and the lack of traditional interlude music during the dialogues in -game. Likewise, the old-fashioned save system returns, with phone booths and separate loading for savegames and settings. The price is right? Available on the PlayStation Store at a price of 59.99 euros, The Yakuza Remaster Collection offers three remastered games for around 20 euros each: a figure that we consider adequate, perhaps slightly high, but the problem is another. In fact, the package allows you to download only Yakuza 3 immediately, postponing the download of the fourth and fifth chapters to October and February respectively: a long wait in the face of an advance payment, with the aggravating circumstance of not being able to purchase the titles individually. Playstation 4 trophies Yakuza 3 includes a total of 50 Trophies, which are obtained by defeating all the bosses present in the campaign but also and above all by dedicating yourself to the side missions and completing them, obtaining a disproportionate amount of money and paying the right attention to all the children of the orphanage Stflower. Gameplay and structure The traditional formula of the series obviously does not change with Yakuza 3: it is the first chapter landed on PlayStation 3, which therefore tried to expand the technical boundaries of the experience with respect to the many limitations of PS2 but paying the price from a technical point of view due to the lack of maturity of the franchise. We therefore have cinematic sequences, undoubtedly the most beautiful thing to see in this remaster as well, which carry on the plot between one section of gameplay and another. The approach is the usual: initially you are guided a little in the exploration and in the tasks that you need to complete, going from point A to point B and facing random enemies along the way, in the context of a progression that often culminates with a boss fight. We didn't remember the combat system so crude, but it is inevitable that even from that point of view Yakuza 3 pays duty: familiar with the first combos and with the upgrades on four categories, which unlock bonuses or additional moves depending on the case , you fight well and the blows return a good sensation of impact. After the first three chapters, however, more space is given to free roaming and the character of the series emerges, also and above all known for the numerous secondary missions (which we find here in their entirety: in the first western version for PS3 several had been cut) and the many collateral activities available within the settings: from golf to darts, passing through Japanese board games, the coin-ops of the ever-present SEGA Clubs and cabaret clubs. The pleasure of simply walking around, taking advantage of a virtual trip to Japan, is unfortunately greatly diminished by the fact that Yakuza 3 is a simple remaster, with graphics brought to high resolution and some ~critical~ textures replaced on the fly: a very different job compared to the one made with the aforementioned Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2, and a real shame for anyone who would have liked to enjoy the same treatment for the episodes that were still missing on PS4.", "date": "2019-08-26", "grade": "7.0"}
