Among the most eagerly awaited and constantly postponed titles, Project CARS (acronym for Community Assisted Racing Simulator) is one of those that has most indisposed users, as it has reached the finish line several times and been relocated again to a later date by the developers, the British Slightly Mad Sudios, up to the very last hot weeks and the announcement of the fateful date of May 7, branded on the calendar. To further amplify the suffering wait of the enthusiasts, the spectacular trailers released by the publisher Bandai Namco, the news on the substantial number of contents and, as far as the PlayStation 4 users are concerned, the absence of a simulation racing game capable of occupy the throne temporarily left vacant by Gran Turismo. Today, finally, we are here to tell you about the definitive PC code of the first game produced within the World of Mass Development platform, and we can already tell you that the additional time required by the developers has been really well spent. Project CARS: the summa of virtual motoring according to Slightly Mad Sudios From rags to riches We can finally provide you with all the information about Project CARS, starting from the exciting Career mode which until today has remained partially covered by a veil, except for a video released by game designer Andy Tudor. But let's proceed in order and begin our examination with the structure of the main menu. This reflects the stylistic features of the most recent dashboards, and the various sections that make up the package find space within the elegant squares and rectangles. The beating heart of Project CARS is divided into four macro areas, namely the aforementioned Career, the Solo mode where you can organize a complete (or quick) race weekend by setting a plethora of options, the Online and the Network Drivers, in which it is possible to participate in cyclical events organized for the community. As far as the Career is concerned, we are faced with one of the largest and most entertaining single player modes ever developed in a racing game, where the hand of the passionate users of World of Mass Development is evident, who have shaped its appearance through their own feedback . Once you have selected the details of your driver, such as name, nickname and preferred number to use in the race, you can freely decide which automotive category to start in among the many proposals, in turn pigeonholed into the so-called Tiers, which play a fundamental role in the objectives to be achieved and in progression. The beauty of Project CARS' career lies precisely in the incredible number of challenges and prizes to be conquered, hand-in-hand with the approach you decide to use. Starting from the Tier 8 Karts (the lowest) and reaching the LMP1 Sports Prototype World Championship in Tier 1 over the course of ten seasons, it is possible to unlock the feat called ~From Stables to the Stars~, while defending the title in a specific category for at least three consecutive years, the reigning Champion is conquered. Tre Corone is obtained by winning champions in three distinct automotive disciplines, after having reached a certain Tier, while there are numerous bronze, silver and gold awards relating to individual categories and invitational races, which they enrich with specific events, perhaps dedicated to cars historical, the exciting seasons linked to career progression. Everything is managed through the ever-present calendar, thanks to which you can move from event to event, each featuring its own rules and settings. The touring championship with the Renault Clio Cups, for example, in addition to being one of the best ever thanks to the advice of Nicholas Hamilton, the brother of the much more famous Lewis of Formula 1, offers free practice, qualifying and double-round races, where in the second it is mandatory to make a pit stop. In the main Career Hub there is no shortage of news and email communications with the managers of one's own and other teams, who can contact us to propose new contracts. Since there is neither an economic system nor virtual dealerships, the player's choices simply fall on the level of challenge proposed and the type of car you want to drive. As specified, there is total freedom of movement between the categories, and nobody forbids us to start our path to glory starting from the very fast Formula A. A sea of possibilities If you want to launchand in a totally personalized race weekend unrelated to the career, the Solo mode offers everything a racing game enthusiast could wish for, both in terms of content and options. It's true, the approximately seventy cars available are not very many if compared to the Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo garages, but there is a good variety of categories and many vehicles allow you to compete in exciting single-make competitions, such as the various Formulas (Rookie, A , B, C, Gulf 1000) and the so-called Stock cars. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a good selection of medium and small cars, considering that among the Japanese brands, for example, we find only the Mitsubishi with the Lancer, while among the Italian ones there is only the Pagani, excellent but not able to fill the gap left by Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Alfa Romeo. We hope that ad hoc DLC will arrive, at competitive prices and with some free content. What is surprising in Project CARS is the number of tracks, made up of over thirty settings for a total of about seventy variants, some of which are supported by laser scan technology. Most of them are licensed like Nurburgring Nordschleife, Le Mans, Monza, Laguna Seca, Road America, Spa, Imola, Brands Hatch and Mount Panorama, just to name a few of the most loved and famous, while others are present under lies spoils, such as Azure Circuit (Montecarlo) and Sakitto (Suzuka). Beyond the traditional circuits there are also a couple of very long stages from point A to point B, namely California Highway and Azure Coast, to be enjoyed mainly with road cars. The customization possibilities, as specified, are many, and in addition to being able to manage the number of laps, the level of difficulty (up to the Ace level set to 100), the type of opponents, the rolling start and the practice sessions, can put his hand to the highly refined dynamic weather and the day-night cycle, the real flagship of British production. Just to give you the idea of freedom of action, if you want to participate in a race that starts at dawn and ends at sunset, at night or the following day, with the weather changing from rainy to sunny, perhaps with flashes of fog and real storms, you can easily set it, as well as it is possible to include penalties and flags, damages, tire wear and much more. This versatility maximizes the use of the game on the net, where up to 32 PC players can challenge each other by setting all the above options, also adding restrictions relating to driving aids, the type of damage (actual or only aesthetic), visual and so on. Furthermore, each player has an extremely detailed personal profile, which indicates the number of disconnections, penalties, disqualifications, podiums and completed races, a sort of license with a reputation that determines the level of correctness. At the moment everything works very well, both from the point of view of the solidity of the netcode and of the lobby management, with voting options and ping indicators, however the real test will be with the game for sale and the consequent invasion of the servers. Knowing the past with the launch of DRIVECLUB it is necessary to be cautious. Scalable serene Having ascertained the goodness of the contents and options, the aspect that most interests racing game enthusiasts is undoubtedly the driving model. As we specified in our previous test, we are not dealing with a very pure simulation, such as Assetto Corsa, rFactor or iRacing, but an excellent simulator which, overall, in terms of characteristics and versatility, can be placed halfway between the dynamic model of the Forza Motorsport series and that of the Kunos Simulazioni title, although some considerations must be made. The physics returned by the Madness Engine, in fact, is not studied in the same way in all the cars, and some are simulated much better than others, with peaks in driving pleasure that can be compared to the aforementioned products. The Karts, the various GT category cars and the Tourings come to mind, while the (few) road cars and the Formulas are a little less refined, although significant steps forward have been made in this sense since our last test. especially after fine-tuning the steering wheel. Among others, we really appreciated the Ford Mustang Cobra TransAm, very fast, satisfying in behavior and really fun to drive. Overall, the result is comparable to a solid evolution of the Need for Speed: Shift 2 model, of which Project CARS is a spiritual heir. Naturally, the fidelity of the physical model is significantly shifted vTowards the simulation by disabling the inevitable driving aids (TCS, ABS, Stability control) and acquiring a good ad hoc peripheral, although the title is perfectly enjoyable even with a joypad. The suspension, aerodynamics, brakes and many other features can be modified in the setup menu, where the considerable depth of the options does not interfere with the accessibility of the title. As regards the behavior of the tyres, under a downpour and using certain cars, aquaplaning makes driving far too difficult, even with active aids, and a pinch more balance from this point of view would not have hurt. The management of flags and penalties is generally valid, with some differences in favor of online (in single player you can cheat more easily), just as the behavior of the artificial intelligence is effective, less ~overwhelming~ than in the builds tested in earlier and more respectful of the player controlled car. The damage rendering is also well done and the cars can be completely destroyed, however, in certain circumstances we ran into some not exactly coherent consequences, a historic flaw in racing games. The pit stops, although visually a little limited (there is only the mechanic who positions himself in front of the car), work excellently, and in addition to being able to carry out the classic tire and fuel change, it is possible to intervene on damage and tire pressure, with lots of programmable pit strategies for endurance races. Wet dreams If there is a title that has leveraged its technical skills, this is Project CARS, captivating fans since the publication of the very first screeshots, followed by spectacular trailers and virtuous comparisons with reality that have fueled the wait for the debut. Undoubtedly, to enjoy maximum graphic detail at 60 frames per second, in 4K, a very high-end multi-card system is necessary, nevertheless, for those who are ~satisfied~ with 1080p, a single, powerful card may be sufficient, net of a a result that is almost always splendid and at times astonishing, albeit with some chiaroscuro elements to underline. Let's start right from the fluidity. While it's rock solid under most standard conditions, the large number of variables on the platter can have a significantly negative impact on performance. We are talking above all about heavy rain, which with about twenty cars on the screen can bring down the frame rate by about twenty points: a bit too much considering that it can appear suddenly during a race, substantially changing the enjoyment of the competition. Then there are some particularly demanding circuits from a polygonal point of view, such as the fascinating Azure Circuit (Montecarlo), while in others it is the enormous number of cars that can be accommodated that can cut the legs off fluidity; just think that up to 56 can race on the famous French track of Le Mans. Scalability is in any case guaranteed by the plentiful number of options, which range from the classic anti-aliasing and V-sync filters to the quality of the reflections and twilight rays. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the most incredible aspect of Project CARS lies in the lighting system, capable of giving wonderful views and an incomparable variability for each track. Running on Catalunya, Zolder, Willow Spring and Watkins Glen, just to name a few of the most beautiful, implementing the transition from day to night is a simply fabulous visual experience, all to the advantage of realism and identification. Not to mention the possible intervention of the dynamic weather, with a rendition of the rain that makes your skin crawl: the still images with the cars kissed by rain droplets are real works of art. And speaking of cars, they are all perfectly modeled, with an incisive damage system and very detailed interiors, supported by quality shaders. Unfortunately, night lighting negatively affects the rendering of the bodies and dashboards, which are decidedly flatter than during the day, while the textures, generally very valid, have some negative peaks in some elements of the scenario, such as the California tunnel highway. The circuits are characterized by an infinite horizon (the splendid one of Willow Springs and Dubai), many details on the track and a realistic rendering of the asphalt. The physics of the impacts are good, despite some random consequences in the results, while the audio sector is absolutely stunning, with the sampling of some engines capable of literally exalting the player, thanks to the timbre", "date": "2015-05-06", "grade": "8.8"}
