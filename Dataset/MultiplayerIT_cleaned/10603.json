The expectations of enthusiasts are always higher, so we need to be able to amaze in order to carve out a space in a trend now dominated by historic franchises, with little room for novelties. Milestone has amply demonstrated that he can battle both over the two as much as on four wheels, and with Superstars V8 Racing wants to reiterate that talent is not water and that you don't necessarily need to have infinite economic resources to do something good. The Superstars championship was born in Italy in 2004 and has become international since 2007. Its peculiarity lies in the presence of production cars in racing versions, which even exceed 400 horsepower and guarantee spectacular races with overtaking at the limit. In the game we will find ten real cars, divided between the various teams and with the original drivers: each one guarantees unique characteristics of speed, acceleration and grip that will integrate with our personal approach to racing. Engines on the track There are no news regarding the game modes offered by Superstars V8 Racing: it is possible to try a quick race, do some training on the track, face a race weekend of your choice or an entire championship. There is also a supplementary mode, called ~Superstars License~, with more than twenty challenges of various kinds that can be completed by obtaining gold, silver or bronze medals depending on the quality of our performance. Often such challenges consist of completing race fragments or predetermined situations, crossing the finish line first or making a certain number of overtakings within a time limit. Of course, there is no shortage of online multiplayer with quick, customized or created from scratch matches. There are already several races with players from all over the world, so we were able to do a few laps and check that there are no lag or other problems: it goes as smooth as silk, there is room for twelve participants and the matches they can be lined up to organize classic scoring tournaments. Voice chat is unfortunately not supported at its best: to activate it you have to press the L1 back button and the quality does not make you cry out for a miracle, but this feature on PS3 still seems a bit neglected and there is ample room for improvement. The options available online are the usual, so you can silence a particularly noisy player or chase away those who behave unfairly. For the rest, you can decide whether or not to activate collisions and damage, both things that make a big difference on the track. As for the general options, the driving style can be changed from arcade to simulation, but we are given ample freedom about activating individual aids to obtain a personalized setting. Unfortunately it is not possible to adjust the sensitivity of the left analog stick, which prevents us from ~brushing~ the curves as we would like given the presence of an annoying central ~dead zone~: too bad. Playstation 3 trophies Superstars V8 Racing offers a total of thirty-five trophies divided between bronze, silver and gold. The former are unlocked by completing rather simple objectives: winning the first race, winning using a particular driver, on a particular track or by selecting a certain level of difficulty. For silver trophies the situation becomes more complicated: you have to win ten races, reach a certain position in the standings at the end of the championship, complete some challenges and so on. Finally, the gold trophies are obtained by completing all the challenges, by winning the championship with Gianni Morbidelli or with the CAAL team, or by doing it with any rider but at the ~legend~ difficulty level. The long road to victory As always happens, the championship mode turns out to be the most complex and multifaceted, with its nine tracks and the accurate reproduction of all the phases that make up a race weekend. We can therefore do some free laps on the track to memorize the curves and find the trajectories best, fine-tune the set-up so that it best suits our needs or use the pre-set settings for the race or qualifying, which respectively provide us with better control or higher speed. There is the obvious qualifying session with its fastest laps, then the race proper. While in the pits we can speed up the remaining time for each session, or go directly to the next if we don't feel like waiting. Once on the track together with the other concorsre, when the light turns green, Superstars V8 Racing shows its cards and offers us an immersive and challenging experience. Each driving aid has its weight, but disabling them all does not translate into the tragedy one might think: thanks to the set-up adjustments, the cars are always controllable and to go into a spin you have to abuse the traction in particular conditions (when traveling hairpin bends at low speed or when the asphalt is wet). The opponents' artificial intelligence is good but not extraordinary, it usually happens that you get detached on the straights and then recover by tackling a few corners with more personality. Crossing the finish line first is never a walk in the park and you have to pay close attention to collisions. In fact, following an accident, the car often starts to pull to one side and in such conditions getting into the points becomes a desperate undertaking. The weather is variable, so sunny and rainy days alternate with serious repercussions on the way you ride: when the asphalt is wet and you opt for ~simulation~ driving, it becomes really easy to go off the road and lose positions. Switching from automatic to manual (default assigned to the Triangle and Circle buttons), unlike many racing games, involves substantial differences during the acceleration phase. In this case, the automatic ratios are not so ~intelligent~ as to cancel the gap compared to the manual ones, and so you are faced with particularly difficult restarts. Technical realization As per tradition for Milestone titles, an extraordinary job has been done with regard to the cars, which reproduce the real models down to the smallest detail. The shots that can already be seen from the initial screen are excellent, and obviously you can enjoy such detail even on the track, during a race or while watching replays. Unlike what was done for the SBK and MotoGP series, where it sometimes felt like racing in a desolate wasteland, this time the scenarios are very beautiful and offer cross-sections of distant citizens as well as a design of the tracks, as always, at the top in terms of fidelity and detail. At the top there are also the textures, of a decidedly above average quality, while the graphics engine manages to manage everything in a really fluid and fast way, even if unfortunately there are some uncertainties during the most agitated phases. The sound boasts a tough introductory theme, but during races it shuts down to make room for the effects.", "date": "2009-07-27", "grade": "7.5"}
