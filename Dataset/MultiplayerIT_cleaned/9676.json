It is to be imagined that not even Akira Toriyama, when he began to draw the plates of this strange reinterpretation of the ancient ~Journey to the West~ in the early 80s, expected to lay the foundations for an irrepressible success which, from Japan, would infected the whole world within a couple of decades, totaling best-selling numbers. The reach of the commercial phenomenon extends like a tide from manga to anime, passing through action figures to obviously video games. This is certainly not the right place to analyze the reasons for such a global success, however in some cases the suspicion arises that the simple over-exposure pushed with rather continuous vehemence by Shueisha / Toei / Bandai has somehow triggered a mechanism of self-feeding of consensus towards the brand, beyond the intrinsic value that Toriyama's pages - especially in the adolescent or pre-adolescent phase - certainly possess. According to Wikipedia (the lazy editor's resource), there are as many as 67 Dragon Ball-inspired video games released on multiple platforms over the brand's 25-year history, most of which belong to the fighting game genre. In light of these numbers, it is not easy to avoid branding the arrival of a new exponent of the genre, based on the same series, as a mere commercial operation, however, elements can be identified that justify the recursive persistence of Dragon Ball fighting games. It is a sort of genre in its own right, which can count on a continuous generational turnover of its audience and which is therefore re-proposed at different times and on different platforms, evolving together with the video game medium itself. Less justifiable, however, is the annual release of new chapters without changes such as to substantially evolve the gaming experience, which transfers this Raging Blast 2, with all its ambitions from a complex fighting game, into the muffled world self-referential products specifically dedicated to Dragon Ball fans. A galaxy of fights What must certainly be recognized to Spike, the development team of this Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2, is the effort made in filling the game with content. The roster of selectable fighters has further increased and now has around 90 usable characters, each equipped with a vast number of signature attacks and special abilities that determine a frightening amount of moves, although they are all quite similar in effects and usage mechanics. To the amount of characters and related transformations must be added the customization possibilities that can be carried out on each individual fighter with the application of additional objects and skills to be conquered and expanded by carrying on the ~story mode~, which is more vast than ever. In fact, for each character it is possible to follow their own ~narrative~ path, obviously punctuated by progressive fights and also characterized by crossroads that open the door to unprecedented alternative scenarios with respect to the traditional history of the series. The problem is that in all this narrative there is very little, beyond a few jokes without a real logical link exchanged by the fighters at the beginning of each match, therefore the interest in continuing relies above all on the will to collect as many as many bonuses as possible from clash to clash and from this point of view the game certainly does not prove sparing: between unlockable characters, alternative costumes, characteristics and secret abilities to conquer, a true Dragon Ball fan will certainly find bread for his teeth. In short, the typical drama of the clashes present in the comic/anime is almost completely lost but it is gained in possible combinations of characters and parallel digressions, but it is difficult not to regret some interlude skits with an epic flavor. At the end of each fight we find ourselves on a sort of grid that we can ~navigate~ by moving to the main nodes, corresponding to as many fights. Each of these fights therefore presents a particular scene and is characterized by specific rules that the fight must obey, such as certain time limits, variable quantities of enemies or various types of handicaps imposed on the player. The eternal clashes The fighting game structure is derived from that of the first Raging Blast, which offers different types of attack distributed on the various keys of the controller, with the right analog stick dedicated to the use of special skills. The combat system has been expanded and deepened respchapter to the first chapter, making it more complex to master but thus inserting a considerable number of attacks, defensive maneuvers and special powers that cover the entirety of the repertoires for each individual character. We therefore find ourselves with classic attacks, combos, grips, attacks with aura (from a distance) and special abilities to be performed by consuming the aura, rechargeable by pressing a button with the typical ~flaming~ animation, as well as having the possibility of flying with the simple push of a button. The correspondence and the substantial equivalence of many attacks of the different characters helps to reinforce the feeling that there is not a big difference between one fighter and another, beyond the obvious graphic and animation distinctions and this considerably flattens the element strategic and differentiating that such a quantity of characters could bring to the game structure. Here too, therefore, the attempt to make the combat system more complex in order to encroach on the territory of classic fighting games is only partially achieved, while the iron will to experiment with all the typical moves of the favorite characters remains a fundamental element to get seriously challenged. 'operates between key combinations. It is not so much the strategic depth of the combat that makes such a quantity of moves necessary, but rather the usual collecting spirit of a manga licensed product. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but it's a matter of perspective: if you expect the perfect balance between different characters who fit together like in a Street Fighter, say, we're off track. Here the generous stuffing of fighters and moves responds to the need to create the definitive video game simulation of the Dragon Ball universe, which in itself is however commendable and largely achieved. Too bad that beyond the excitement of playing the various characters in the series, reproduced with great detail and characteristic moves, the fun given by the mechanism of the clashes - here somewhat simplified - tends to disappear. Xbox 360 goals There are 50 achievements per 1000 gamerpoints total within the game. Given the structure fragmented into many game options, the complete collection goes through the commitment in each of these, trying to achieve particular results within all the various sections. The work of collecting the achievements is therefore long and certainly not easy, but for a true Dragon Ball fan it could be within reach. It's over nine thousand The abundance of characters and moves corresponds to an equally wide choice of game modes, including single and multiplayer. In addition to the aforementioned single-player ~galaxy~ mode, we can try our hand at the tutorial, in progressive clashes within levels to be completed, in the various tournaments typical of the series (Tenkaichi, the game of Cell) both in single and in multiplayer and obviously launching online challenges, among other options. Spike has certainly not limited itself in terms of game solutions, thus guaranteeing a large amount of hours distributed over rather different playful experiences, albeit all based on the same type of gameplay. Even from a technical point of view, there have been evolutions compared to the first Raging Blast, albeit less evident with respect to the content. One of the most heralded novelties is given by the possibility of interacting with the surrounding environments, essentially destroying them. In fact, as per Dragon Ball tradition, the fights do not take place within limited arenas but in decidedly vast environments (which reflect the topical settings of the series) in which it is possible to move freely on the ground, in the air and even underwater. In correspondence with significant elements of the scenario and particularly powerful attacks, it is possible to see the effect of these on the surrounding environment, with decidedly spectacular results between crumbling mountains, collapsing buildings and chasms that open on the ground, for example. Connected to the possibility of freely roaming the play areas and the simultaneous need to keep one's gaze focused on the opponent is the solution adopted to frame the fight, which also in this chapter, as in the previous one, generally proves rather awkward and in certain cases really annoying. In fact, the camera placed behind the protagonist often places the opponent in a blind spot or fails to follow the sudden changes of position and direction with the necessary speed, with obvious negative implications on the usability of the game. The wash is excellentro carried out on the modeling of the various fighters, which thanks to a clever use of cel-shading are practically identical to the animated counterparts of the cartoon, both in terms of appearance and proportions and in terms of animation.", "date": "2010-11-04", "grade": "6.0"}
