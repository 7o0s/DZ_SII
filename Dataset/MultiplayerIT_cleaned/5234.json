{"name": "Star Ocean: The Divine Force", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-ocean-the-divine-force-recensione.html", "text": "The story of Star Ocean is strange, a niche series that initially very few JRPG enthusiasts spun - unlike the twin Tales of who shares its authorship - and that when it tried the road to popularity it tried everything, absolutely everything, please in every corner of the world: memorable, for example, the International version of The Last Hope, which allowed you to choose between the very ugly CGI portraits ~for Westerners~ and the cartoon ones ~for the Japanese~. Despite his efforts, Star Ocean continued to remain in its niche, so much so that at one point even Square Enix, which in the meantime had taken over the publication of the tri-Ace titles, let seven years pass between each chapter and the next, to then come up with Star Ocean 5: Integrity & Faithfulness: made with pennies, to ~assess the interest of the players~, as if a mediocre game could relaunch an entire brand. It seemed that for Star Ocean it was over there, in that summer of 2016, when instead the brand made a surprise reappearance in a 2021 State of Play with a new chapter, the sixth if we don't count the spin-offs, which we have been playing in these days. In our review of Star Ocean: The Divine Force we will tell you how it went this time and if tri-Ace has managed to really renew the series for which he founded the company back in 1995... The story and the characters Laetitia is one of the two protagonists of Star Ocean: The Divine Force It must be said that Star Ocean has never shone on the narrative front, and therefore we were surprised to find that The Divine Force boasts a captivating storyline and, above all, a solid all-round cast. No skimpy-clad lolitas needlessly squealing this time around: even the youngest member of the cast, the show-stopping Nina Deforges, is a sufficiently mature character detached from clichs. Despite this, The Divine Force maintains more or less all the iconic characteristics of the series, starting with the premise in pure Star Trek style: the story, in fact, begins when the Ydas transport spaceship is shot down over Aster IV, a backward planet in which the kingdom of Aucerius and the empire of Vey'l are now at loggerheads. Having narrowly escaped the destruction of his ship and landed on Aster IV in an escape pod, Captain Raymond Lawrence runs into Princess Laetitia Aucerius and her bodyguard Albaird Bergholm: they help him find Chloe, the young pilot of the Ydas who ended up somewhere on the planet, and he will accompany them in their search for the brilliant but surly semiomancer Midas Felgreed. In reality, to fully understand all the passages of the story, one should play Star Ocean: The Divine Foce at least twice. At the beginning, in fact, we can indicate Raymond or Laetitia as the main protagonist, just like it happened with Claude and Rena in Star Ocean: Second Evolution. The decision will change some scenes, which we will see from the point of view of one or the other, and will also affect certain content, such as the playable characters that will join the team. Although this dynamic tends to disorient the narrative - there are moments in which one really has the impression of having lost some piece of history along the way - the plot works right away: the screenplay by Yoshiharu Gotanda, who also created the series, reveals the focal points a little at a time, without firing all the cartridges immediately, but gradually introducing the real threat that will unite the protagonists and which, in pure Star Ocean style, will see them fight not only for Aster IV, but for the whole the galaxy. In Star Ocean: The Divine Force demiomacers like Midas can cast spells As we anticipated, the narrative works thanks also and above all to the cast. Bearing in mind that Italian is not supported even in the texts, the game is dubbed in English and Japanese: in English, the dubbers all in all do a good job - apart from Laetitia, who is almost unlistenable - but obviously we advise you to set the language to Japanese if you prefer a more anime feel. However, we appreciated the characterization of the various characters and the massive amount of dialogues that intervene to better outline their relationships even during explorations, but it is a pity that Motoi Sakuraba's soundtrack seemed less incisive than his previous collaborations. The problem, if anything, is the way in which the tri-Ace programmers have translated Akira Yasuda's illustrations into 3D models: as pure and simple character design, we are faced with the best Star Ocean ever, with a care for details of the costumes really flawless, but in the game the polygonal models are less convincing,albeit detailed, and animated in a woody and not very credible way during the cinematics of the story, but much better in the fights. Navigate between old-gen and current-gen The maps in Star Ocean: The Divine Force are vast and fun to explore. The graphics issue extends somewhat throughout the game, but maybe not as you might think. Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a cross-gen title, which also comes out for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and which therefore feels not only the weight of the past on its shoulders, but also of a tight budget. It's a continuous contradiction, the tri-Ace game, because you go from liquid surfaces that don't react at all to the input of a 3D model, which only seems to walk in an ugly transparent texture, to scenarios full of minute details. The various cities are all different from each other, separated by macro-zones that form the game world, a bit like what has been happening in the JRPGs of the Tales of series for some years now. The scenarios, however, are truly breathtaking, with an attention to detail, geometry and lighting that slightly makes up for the other shortcomings. These scenarios also develop vertically, but perhaps tri-Ace was too ambitious and gone the extra mile, which then we could say for every other feature of Star Ocean: The Divine Force and close the review here. Exploration is perhaps the best part, or in any case the most innovative one for the series, but it also demonstrates the developer's inadequacy. In Star Ocean: The Divine Force, DUMA allows you to fly for a short time DUMA is a kind of drone that becomes a gameplay mechanic in both exploration and combat. Any character can use it: just hold down a key to load a propulsion - also called VA - which will project us in the chosen direction. It's not about flying, but about taking long shots, followed by a possible descent in slow motion, and this simple addition is enough to completely change the exploration. DUMA speeds up moving on foot - and if you want to go even faster, you can travel quickly from one destination to another at any time - and opens the door to more careful exploration, also because the map doesn't automatically mark chests and collectibles, and the drone's scan range still implies being in their vicinity to spot them on the radar. Once you have passed the introduction and obtained DUMA, you immediately understand how much fun it can be to explore these vast scenarios, perhaps in search of objects or materials, or of secret passages and shortcuts that allow you to cut from one point of the map to another, which be it a large valley or a city like the gigantic capital. In the main menu of Star Ocean: The Divine Force we can change the party Continuing the adventure, you come across areas designed precisely to take advantage of this game dynamic. Some dungeons, above all, that force us to think in three dimensions to solve the puzzles and reach the exit, or even just to avoid too challenging enemies. The purple crystals scattered around the map are called DUMA Pts, and they're important because they serve to boost DUMA not only for exploration, but also in combat, and because they're often cleverly placed to trick us into using aerial dash creatively. and also because, by following them, sooner or later one arrives at some chest or collectible. tri-Ace, in short, the dynamics of exploration have been well thought out, but as we said there are some technical problems that sometimes diminish the commitment from the developer: invisible barriers, bizarre collisions, little obvious interactive elements that you end up looking for in circles, and there are also moments in which you get stuck in some wrong three-dimensional space, with the risk of having to restart the game if you don't find it just the right angle to blast out via VA. These are situations that don't happen as often as one might fear, but which betray a level of cleanliness that is not exactly impeccable. Fighting with weapons and more Star Ocean: The Divine Force, Nina can heal area with her bell. Exploring is a lot of fun, but we don't deny that some improvements to the quality of life would have made Star Ocean: The Divine Force seem less acerbic title. Take the secondary missions, for example: indicated on the map by yellow dots, which represent the NPCs who will entrust them to us, they can be consulted from a dedicated screen which, however, offers very few indications on what to do to solve them, in a game that is already stingy with suggestions . Once the mission is completed, you can choose whether to return immediately to deliver it, except to discover that the travelquick play only takes us back to the entrance to the map where the NPC is located, which we will have to go and look for by sifting through the city on duty up and down. This kind of edginess, and the fact that you don't know the rewards in advance, doesn't encourage you to take on the side missions which, moreover, are simple tasks with no narrative. As simplistic as they are obtuse and not at all stimulating, the craftsmanship also leaves something to be desired . Characters accumulate SP for each successful creation, and by leveling up they acquire new skills that allow the creation of better items. The process is intuitive, but slow and unnecessarily expensive - it's hard to imagine that you still can't do better than any Atelier or the excellent crafting system in Dragon Quest XI. In Star Ocean: The Divine Force you can choose whether to have Raymond or Laetitia as the protagonist Yet tri-Ace seems to have learned nothing from past mistakes. The crafting system was bad in previous Star Oceans and hasn't improved in The Divine Force, but fortunately it can be ignored - unless you intend to dissect the game in its entirety - and it's not the only pastime between battle and the other. We mentioned that some characters in cities offer side quests; well, everyone else - or rather, everyone else you can interact with - will want to play Es'owa instead: think of Final Fantasy's Triple Triad or Tetra Master, but with chess depicting completely generic units or characters historians of Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile. We have to admit that it's a very fun minigame, but of dubious utility, and it's not clear why we should commit ourselves to climbing the ranks of Es'owa players. But after all, the tutorials don't go wild in who knows what detailed explanations of the game mechanics... In Star Ocean: The Divine Force different characters use different fighting styles Which could also please those who hate being taken by the hand, but it becomes frustrating when it comes to battles, and the saga's combat system is known to be very technical, but also unnecessarily complicated. The Divine Force is no exception. Basically, each character can associate a series of Combat Skills to the three buttons on the controller, which are learned by spending the points earned by leveling up in the individual Skill Trees: by pressing a button in sequence, up to three can be performed, or if he can perform another by holding it down. Potentially you have access to a maximum of twelve Combat Skills, whether they are the same or different is up to the player, but it is certainly better to build the so-called Chain Combos by thinking about the animations and functions of these techniques. For example, we can form a Chain Combo that begins with a melee attack, continues with a blow that knocks the enemy away, and ends with a ranged projectile that hits him while he is far away. The gist is this, but there are various factors to keep in mind, such as the loading speed of these Combat Skills - especially if they are spells that have a casting time - or the AP they consume: this resource recharges over time and if the AP consumed by a Chain Combo is greater than what the controlled character has available, the chain simply cannot be closed. Enemies roam freely across the maps in Star Ocean: The Divine Force It must be said that the characters are also very different in terms of gameplay and the fact that you can control them all, and switch from one to the other in an instant during the fight, is no small virtue. Up to four characters can be fielded in combat, while the others remain on the bench, and therefore it makes sense to build the party by including fighters who can also heal like Nina or buff / debuff allies and enemies like Albaird does. Although they are much less than Integrity & Faithfulness, however, The Divine Force is an even more chaotic title, and perhaps this is its weak point. The problem does not lie in the sometimes exaggerated effects - and also spectacular, for heaven's sake - nor in the quantity of characters and enemies that move in real time on the battlefield, but in the general visual confusion which, net of an inaccurate camera , resizes the technical component of the combat system, which should contemplate perfect dodges, which slow down time for a moment and regenerate AP, and more or less strategic choices to be made at high speed. Fortunately, there is a form of tactical pause like that of Final Fantasy VII Remake, to be used to catch your breath, change the strategy of the intellig", "date": "2022-10-27", "grade": "7.0"}
