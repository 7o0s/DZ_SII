{"name": "Noby Noby Boy - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/noby-noby-boy-recensione.html", "text": "If we asked you to think of the most original, extravagant and unconventional game you've tried during your gaming career, probably many would answer Katamari Damacy, or maybe Parappa the Rapper, or LocoRoco, or maybe Vib Ribbon. Surely there are others, titles characterized by a great personality and the ability to offer something different from the classic canons imposed by the market. But none of these ~experiments~ had so far reached the authentic madness of Noby Noby Boy, that's for sure... The beauty of not having a purpose Born from the evidently disturbed mind of Keita Takahashi, author of the first Katamari, Noby Noby Boy available exclusively on PSN is simply the apotheosis of the surreal videogame fact. The protagonist is precisely the BOY, a kind of being on all fours with a head and a tail at the ends of the body. These two parts are associated individually to the two analog sticks, and by tilting them in the opposite direction as a result we obtain the lengthening of the BOY, which thus becomes a kind of colorful worm to move within more or less extensive settings. The aim, if we want to define it that way, is to stretch the protagonist as much as possible to then send his result - at the end of a session - via the Sun to the GIRL. The latter will then collect the efforts of all the Noby Noby Boy players scattered throughout the world and connected online, extending in turn until it reaches the various planets; at the time of writing the GIRL has arrived on the Moon (4 days after the release of the title on PSN), thus unlocking the relative setting available to everyone. Next target? Mars of course! An intriguing social aspect that suggests a stimulus, a cooperation within a gameplay that would otherwise be simply ~pointless~, with no purpose other than pure entertainment. And precisely for this reason Noby Noby Boy is the strongest expression of the game that you either love or hate, with no middle ground. One must undoubtedly be inclined to enter into harmony with what is in all respects a fair of the absurd to the nth degree. The experience should be basically assimilated to that of a sandbox, or rather a toy to interact with, nothing more and nothing less. We were talking about the levels, which are generated in a totally random way both for the dimensions and for what they contain; maybe you can find yourself in a kind of city village with houses and inhabitants who move around on cars or scooters, or in the middle of a forest populated by flying fish, or even in a desert with Zulus, lions, cows and ancient Romans . What's the point of all this? None of course, but that's the beauty of Noby Noby Boy. As written above, the control system allows you to move and extend your BOY using the two analog sticks; in addition to this, the basic commands allow you to repeatedly jump up to hover in the sky (by quickly pressing R2 or L2), or cling to the ground to maintain stability (the same keys held down), or even swallow much of what composes the layers - including humans - to fatten and then eject them from the back. The interaction is therefore high, but the results also in this case are certainly not what one might expect; uncovering houses or dragging large objects are commonplace, just as it is normal to observe the inhabitants of the settings flee in fear in front of the BOY, or climb on his back to go for a ride, or even stop and admire his evolutions . An artificial intelligence therefore quite simple but which often determines unexpected behaviors and in any case amusing even just to observe. I stretchoooooooo Noby Noby Boy is therefore a product that is anything but conventional, which stimulates experimentation. Apart from some initial tips, actually quite obscure, the game limits itself to providing the basic information, encouraging the user to have fun trying and discovering what it has to offer. And this is precisely the strength of Namco Bandai's production, or rather the charm of such an illogical and bizarre universe in which to lose a few minutes or whole hours simply having fun trying, manipulating, interacting without fear of game over and without the nagging of a real progression that in this case simply does not exist. And just like with anything fun, the beauty lies in being able to share it with others; therefore, in addition to being able to send messages to your friends that will be displayed on the BOY's body, there is the possibility of taking pictures and above all recording videos of the prosprie deeds to send on Youtube in a very simple way directly from within the game. We deliberately left the technical discourse at the end because there really isn't much to say; if we had to rate it based on how much the PS3 hardware is used it would probably give it a 1, but it makes no sense to look in Noby Noby Boy for a display of polygons and effects. On the contrary, the ultra-minimalist and stylized style adds further charm and personality to a product that is absolutely overflowing with it. Comment Noby Noby Boy is a toy, a surreal experience far removed from anything we've ever experienced with a pad in hand. To be able to appreciate it, it is necessary to have a particular predisposition for original experiments, many kilometers away from the classic dictates of the world of video games; for this reason Takahashi's effort will certainly be (indeed it already is) a small cult classic for a certain portion of Ps3 users. But even for the skeptics, we believe that at the price of only 3.99 euros the Namco Bandai production undoubtedly deserves to be tried; perhaps you will hate it and curse us for the advice, but if on the contrary you will be fascinated by it then Noby Noby Boy will in all probability be able to enter the small circle of titles capable of leaving an indelible mark on your memory. Pros Unlike any other game Surreal, hypnotic and engaging Price more than correct Against Either you love it or you hate it with no in between", "date": "2009-02-27", "grade": null}
