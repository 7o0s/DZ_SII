So don't be surprised if, playing the first hours of the new Crystal Dynamics production, you get the impression that she is making you wait a little too long. If that helpless, frightened and perpetually bloodied girl whose fate you are shaping pad in hand will seem completely foreign to you, this is due to the intention of the developers to propose a completely new narrative course for the adventures of the English archaeologist. Although the well-to-do origins, the green tank top and a certain propensity for exploring ancient dungeons remain, a lot has changed in the gameplay formula, now much more similar to that of a traditional action adventure of this generation. With all due respect to the nostalgics, the new Tomb Raider is still a game full of content and capable of disguising a substantial linearity with a very strong characterization of the setting, obtaining interesting results, as we will see. Survived As anticipated during the long promotional campaign, Tomb Raider focuses entirely on the characterization of the new Lara and on narrating the reasons for her transformation into a survivor, ensuring that the player experiences all the physical and psychological traumas that the archaeologist in the grass is to bear. The island therefore becomes the real enemy to be defeated, dotted with fierce enemies, insidious traps, sacrificial rites and imposing natural barriers. These very dark themes are combined with a more traditional gameplay that rationalizes the playful offer, punctuating shootings and climbing sequences with regularity, surrounding everything with a dominant cinematic guise. If this formula were to be familiar to you, it is very likely that in your career as a video gamer you have spent some time with the Uncharted trilogy, an exclusive Playstation 3 starring a sort of trigger-happy new Indiana Jones, Nathan Drake. In fact, a few minutes in the company of the new Lara are enough to realize how Crystal Dynamics has evidently taken a cue from the work of Naughty Dog to work on the return of the English archaeologist, starting from those solid foundations and trying to adapt them as much as possible to the theme of survival . In this sense, Tomb Raider is configured as an evolution of the gameplay proposed by the last two Uncharted, with the intention of offering more variety both in the combat sequences and in the dynamic climbs. This aim was achieved by adding a complex system of growth and advancement of Lara's skills and the arsenal at her disposal to the normal scrolling of levels. By accessing the camps, i.e. campfires positioned regularly in the maps, it will in fact be possible to spend the accumulated skill points in three different skill trees, in a very similar way to what was seen in the recent Far Cry 3. However, it should be noted that, unlike what happened in the Ubisoft shooter, these skills are generally more oriented towards unlocking new combat moves and increasing the amount of resources collected, rather than actually enhancing the character. The most interesting peculiarity of Tomb Raider is in fact its ability to propose new possibilities in terms of platforming and combat for almost its entire duration. It all begins with the collection of the so-called Materials, a shared resource that can be recovered both from the crates scattered throughout the levels, and by completing specific physics-related puzzles, or on the corpses of eliminated enemies. Reached a field fire, these can be spent to improve a certain number of characteristics of the weapons available to Lara, namely the bow, a pistol, an assault rifle and a shotgun. This arsenal becomes available progressively, advancing in the levels, and also evolves in appearance, with the entire booklet available exceeding the first third of the game. In addition to increasing its effectiveness and adding secondary fire modes, tool upgrades also open up new possibilities for platforming. The ice ax, for example, can be reinforced to allow the opening of massive chests and the climbing of friable rock walls, previously inaccessible. The bow can instead be equipped with incendiary arrows or attached to a rope, so as to shoot specific objects or create improvised bridges. The level design puts itself fully at the service of this mechanic, proposing ever new platforming solutions as the tools available to the player increase. In this sense, it cannot be said that the climbs offered by Tomb Raider are completesse, but still offer some slight challenge, mostly linked to pressing the X key (or square, on Playstation 3) with timing, useful for hooking onto crumbly walls, or saving yourself in case of an unsteady grip following a jump. Compared to the tradition of the series, it is nevertheless a very clear simplification, given that the partially scripted nature of the context now makes it almost impossible to ~fail~ the hooks towards the next platform. The taut ropes play a very important role, and can be traveled either by sliding or backwards by climbing (at least until a special tool is released, which will allow you to climb them faster). The legacy in Uncharted is most noticeable in the continuous interspersing of the climbs with short scripted events and sudden changes of shot, so as to give the game a marked cinematic connotation. As we shall see, freedom of exploration was naturally sacrificed to a large extent for this purpose. Like at the cinema When you stay on the tracks traced by Crystal Dynamics, the action offered by Tomb Raider flows fast and intense, where the developers must be credited with having created a flow of events almost free of dead moments, and constantly growing, with the last third of the game able to reserve the best surprises in terms of level design. Although the experience is therefore frenetic and overall well packaged, not all aspects concerning it have received the same care. The shootings, which end up occupying a rather important role in the play offer, in fact prove to be very simple to manage and a bit forced in certain dynamics (see the excessive throwing of Molotov cocktails and grenades), mainly due to an artificial intelligence lacking and a level design not always inspired. The enemies are present in different variations, from grenadiers, to armored ones, to those specialized in close combat, and they all reveal themselves to share the same poor inclination to exploit cover. Even if they do, they will often leave their head or other body parts exposed, allowing the player to easily flush them out or get lethal headshots. Therefore, if the confrontation with the enemies is not the best, the feedback of the three firearms and the bow is on the other hand well packaged, as is the cover system, fully automatic and almost always fully efficient. Compared to the ~forced~ shootings, the phases in which it is possible to eliminate different groups of opponents silently, using the arrows of the bow, or approaching from behind and activating a special instant lethal move are more welcome. Also in this case the artificial intelligence turns out to be lacking, with enemies very little aware of the surrounding environment, but the approach remains in any case more pleasant than the shootings. If the action phases and the climbs are already substantially linear, the various cinematic sequences are even more guided which interrupt the traditional gameplay on several occasions. Connected in an elegant and seamless way, these sequences see Lara sliding down escarpments, or swollen rivers, avoiding lethal obstacles by pressing the keys shown on the screen, or eliminating barriers with the shotgun. Unfortunately, as well as already seen, most of the time these sequences turn out to be confusing and unbalanced, requiring a bit of trial and error. They therefore lose in spectacularity, and sometimes get to frustrate the player. Overall, between ups and downs, the Tomb Raider campaign kept us busy for a more than respectable amount of hours, nine abundant at a normal level, collecting only a part of the collectibles. We subsequently repeated difficult, discovering how the difficulty level impacts only and exclusively on the damage inflicted by the enemies, thus limiting the push to repeat the campaign, and explaining the absence of a New Game + mode. Archaeological fragments Browsing around the island, it is impossible not to notice how in Tomb Raider there are fragments of undeveloped gameplay ideas. This is the case, for example, of the possibility of killing and skinning wild animals, or picking a certain type of berry. These peculiarities would seem to indicate the existence, perhaps in an early version of the game, of a hunting and gathering system, perhaps useful for the survival of the protagonist or to support a more in-depth crafting system, but they have evidently not achieved approval. In the final version of the game, they simply return a very small amount of experience points, thus configuring themselves as completely useless actions for gameplay purposes. The same goes for the collectibles known as GPS Coordinates. Given their name, one might expect that when all those in an area are collected, they will lead to the identification of a new point of interest on the map, but, even in this case, the idea has not seen the light, and all what you will get will simply be a bonus in experience. The long years of development make it very unlikely that these ideas have been discarded for reasons of lack of time, if anything suggesting that we wanted to keep the experience as accessible and linear as possible, without however completely depriving the player of the possibility of exploring and carry out research in the area. Sadly, without sound motivation and gameplay rewards, these details will end up being completely, and rightly so, ignored by the majority of gamers. Exploring the island As is evident by observing the available game map, the Tomb Raider island has been substantially divided into well-defined levels, connected to each other by connecting ~corridors~, to be crossed according to a linear progression, so as to support a gameplay very devoted to the scripting, spectacularity and cinematic effect. The level design is almost always expansive, effectively alternating indoor and outdoor settings and offering some interesting fire-based puzzles, but the action only ever flows forward. The only reason to retrace your steps, perhaps taking advantage of the fast travel system that connects some of the camps, are the collectibles. This is honestly perplexing, given that the breadth of some levels is consequently almost wasted, and the need to gather resources would initially seem to suggest an emphasis on the exploratory factor. This is not the case, given that the corpses of defeated enemies and the crates scattered throughout the levels will provide you with more resources and ammunition than necessary, especially unlocked some specific skills, making backtracking effectively useless. It is probably the result of Crystal Dynamics' desire to bring together in the same experience both linearity and a sketch of free exploration, without however taking into account that one ends up irreparably excluding the other. Not wanting to force players to explore the levels to collect resources, the developers have made them immediately available, leaving only the collectibles the role of attraction to invite you to explore the settings. Clearly, this is a rather weak bait, and often not thorough. Apart from the many Diaries, some of which are interesting and able to reveal important background stories on the previous inhabitants of the island and its mysteries, the Relics and the GPS Coordinates do not add anything to the game even once recovered, configuring themselves more than anything else pretexts suitable only for fanatics of 100% completion. Moreover, their search has often been made all too simple, given that without difficulty (and sometimes without even wanting to) one will find maps relating to the individual areas, able to highlight all the collectibles and their precise positions. If we add to this the fact that retracing your steps will mean facing again a part of the enemies already eliminated in the first pass in some of the levels, it is easy to understand how Tomb Raider was in fact designed specifically as a linear experience, and all the rest represent at most an outline. On the other hand, a positive note for the so-called Tombs, a sort of small underground environment that is rather easy to find in the maps, where the player will be required to complete physics-based puzzles to obtain large crates of Materials in exchange. Despite their brevity and lack of utility in terms of character progression, they manage to represent an effective gameplay variant, require a minimum of exploration to be found and are based on an interesting play of elements (fire, wind and so on) . A pinch of mystery Despite the fresh start, Tomb Raider doesn't allow much room for pleasantries. Only a short introductory video separates the start screen from the moment you take control of the controls, with the ~new~ Lara lost on an island in the Dragon Triangle (archipelago off the coast of Japan), following the shipwreck of his ship due to an unexpected storm. From this hasty incipit a rather predictable and at times confusing story kicks off, to the point that it will take some time to understand exactly the roles and motivations of the different supporting actors. Members of Lara's crew, also shipwrecked on the island, are also joined by the mysterious habit", "date": "2013-02-25", "grade": "8.3"}
