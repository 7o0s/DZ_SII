The desire for an interactive narrative takes us far back over the years, with the first experiments born for mainly educational rather than recreational purposes, while the world of video games took its first steps by exploiting laserdisc technology. This category includes titles such as Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, which however exploited the nature of animated films to their advantage, or the old Night Trap for SEGA CD. In this case however, the limit imposed by the media reduced the ambition of the products, so much so that over the years it has been preferred to invest in three-dimensional graphics. By an exquisitely practical definition, today we consider an interactive film a product that relies heavily on the script and an abundant use of cutscenes. However, the newborn CtrlMovie has decided to abruptly recover the old school of thought, adapting it to the present thanks to modern technologies. Late Shift is the result of this decision, a real film shot with flesh and blood actors, qualitatively comparable to a medium-budget television series, where the player establishes the evolution of the story by making decisions in the various crossroads proposed, i.e. the only time he has a way to actually interact with the product. Late Shift could be the beginning of a new era for interactive movies I was just a valet The first striking aspect of Late Shift is the affinity with the media that inspires it. In video games we are by now accustomed to more or less heavy approximations on the narrative sector and the staging, by virtue of all the part played, but the title CtrlMovie does not compromise in this sense: it is a film, also quite well made, with believable actors and an intricate script, the initial impression is that you have started Netflix by mistake, and whether it is appropriate to look for a remote control rather than the controller. The long and evocative introduction shows an overview of a convulsive and active London, while the protagonist's voice-over explains that life is made up of decisions capable of changing an entire existence, drawing a clear parallel with the videogame medium, and it is already in the course of these initial thoughts we have the opportunity to make some small, seemingly innocuous decisions before the title screen arrives. A detail that immediately catches the eye is that the scene never stops, the player has a limited time, marked by a timer, to choose an answer that will influence the narrative junction. When time runs out, if no decision is made, the game itself will do so, further changing the storyline. This system therefore contributes to the fluidity of the film, interrupted only by small slowdowns during the scene change after a juncture. As mentioned, this is the only occasion in which the player has the opportunity to interact with the product, there is no inventory or a real options menu (even if it is possible to pause), an essential structure that manages to push the best the film formula, enriched by the fact that we decide its evolution. The protagonist is a student who works part time as an overnight valet, his life is characterized by a mechanical and tedious routine, but in the course of one night his life will change completely following a truly incredible series of events. It all started with the theft of a car... Choices The numbers of Late Shift are very respectable, the director has prepared a sufficient amount of material for an entire television season: over four hours of footage as a database for the evolution of the story, which however actually unfolds over a maximum duration of ninety minutes, and 180 different choices. This involves a great variety of situations, even locations, as the scenarios can vary according to the evolution of the story, all leading to seven different endings. Basically it is possible to finish the story in less than forty minutes, just after the first part, structurally more linear precisely to lay the foundations of the story. Obviously it is difficult to go into details without risking spoilers, it is enough to know that our protagonist is involved in a daring criminal enterprise against his will, and will have to manage the consequences by dividing himself between a very dangerous Chinese dynasty, the police and an unlikely love affair, even if in in this case the choices made are fundamental. All this is only the beginning of the innumerable intrigues that await us, and that we must discover by analyzing the details of the plot. The best solution isn't necessarily the most obvious, and arriving at the most satisfying ending requires a number of crucial insights and anhow amazing. In this sense, we were surprised by the care taken towards apparently inconclusive crossroads, but which instead have a way of heavily influencing the economy of history. The decision to opt for an action thriller rather than genres more akin to a dynamic structure, such as horror, brings benefits that are not immediately perceptible: if the first viewing is rather linear, with an initially bland pace but a good central and final shot, it is in the following games the fun begins, exploiting the information acquired previously, and not yet discovered by the protagonist, to calibrate a more profitable development. It is certainly not the first foray into a ~playful~ cinema, we have seen the same structure in the German film Lola Corre by Tom Tywker, a wild film that saw the actress Franka Potente (Lola, in fact) relive a specific time frame of history several times , using a narrative save point and keeping the experience gained to solve a desperate situation. However, the filmic references of Late Shift are many, ranging from Martin Scorsese's Out of Hours and an evident admiration for English directors such as Sam Mendes and Matthew Vaughn, in fact there are different analogies respectively with Specter and The Pusher. The cast sees Joe Sowerbutts wearing the role of the protagonist Matt very well, accompanied by the oriental charm of Haruka Abe and the more Anglo-Saxon one of Lily Travers (Me before you). Directed by Tobias Weber. Xbox One goals To win the 1000 Late Shift player points and the 20 objectives you will need to be able to dissect the Late Shift plot in its entirety, including its seven endings, but also antithetical decisions which obviously will force you to return to the same sequence several times. More movie than game Although the technical quality fluctuates, between some successful scenes, others more functional and a sufficient cast that finds the most convincing element in the protagonist, Late Shift really works like a film, with a rather impressive general effect and an excellent sense of involvement. helped by the choice to never stop the action. Some choices are not easy at all, the time to make a decision is limited and we are also faced with some moral dilemmas capable of drastically changing the story and Matt's destiny. As mentioned, it is also possible to finish the game in record time and with disastrous epilogues, it all depends on our ability to read the many details of the plot, even if obviously there is also a functional ~trial & error~ component to lengthen the general experience . The most annoying problem we have encountered is probably linked to budget impositions, although the product is quite accurate, some scenes have a deficient audio mixing which prevents us from understanding the dialogues, on these occasions the volume of the music and the effects are excessive, up to to cover the voices of the actors. Fortunately, the presence of subtitles in Italian (the audio is in English) avoids a defect that could have seriously ruined the title. We reiterate the aforementioned, sporadic slowdowns and loss of synchrony at the various junctions, probably caused by the loading of the high definition data flow, it is nothing particularly serious, but sometimes it is annoying. Reviewing entire sequences to find the most suitable junction can ultimately prove to be a tedious operation, in fact there is no way to restart the game from a precise chapter, but each time you are forced to experience the film entirely.", "date": "2017-04-30", "grade": "8.0"}
