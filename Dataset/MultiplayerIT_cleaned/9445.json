{"name": "Century: Age of Ashes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/century-age-of-ashes-recensione.html", "text": "When the forgettable Lair was released in 2007, all the kids of the time began to realize what it can actually mean to be riding a dragon: chases, escapes, duels with fireballs and flaming breaths, melee and mass destruction. Although the game didn't make us cry out for a miracle, it did however teach us and here we are at the end of 2021 holding a product that is not only extremely fun, but also and above all more profound and dynamic than we ever expected, especially from a free to play. The Playwing guys are at their first job and we must say that if these are the premises, it is legitimate to expect great products in the future. But let's see the reasons that lead us to praise this game in the Century: Age of Ashes review. Wyverns, not Dragons An artwork from Century: Age of Ashes We think it is necessary to give the title of the paragraph to a fundamental aspect for any nerd who can be defined as such. The ~dragons~ of Century: Age of Ashes are all wyverns which, for the uninitiated, differ from their cousins in that they have wings paired with the upper limbs, rather than having them on the back. Let's understand immediately, it's certainly a perfectly fitting choice, given that wyverns have always been more agile and agile than a traditional dragon, having the ability to cut the air better and having fewer ~limbs~ to control. Having made this brief introduction, we can begin by saying that the title has almost no narrative basis, the wyverns and their knights are found in the arenas on which the various skirmishes take place for an unspecified reason, but so be it. We feel like saying that basically the relevance of this detail is almost nil given the exclusively PvP nature (for now) of the game. After a short and exhaustive tutorial, which can be repeated whenever you want, we are faced with an immediate choice to face the first of several air battles: that of the class. Century: Age of Ashes gives us the possibility to choose between 3 classes, Marauder, Phantom and Windguard, all with their own peculiar characteristics and abilities, as well as a set of specific wyverns with various cosmetics, skins and trinkets. The Marauder is a kind of attacker, the class with the most firepower and perhaps with the most stylish, stocky, muscular and ~mean~ beasts. Its special ability consists in empowering itself and affixing a mark to an opponent under fire so as to inflict more damage and, in the case of killing the same, persevere in its enhanced status. The Windguard on his side has a more sinuous and elegant style, with almost more feminine movements (in fact his base rider is a woman) and is the healer of the group, being able to help with the release of a toxic cloud that blinds the opponent or with his special move by healing and protecting a companion. The Phantom, on the other hand, as the name implies, has a more disturbing appearance, almost as if it wanted to intimidate the opponent by coming out of the invisibility of its special, and then piercing the opponent's shields. These three classes make the clashes frenetic and tremendously beautiful to see and play. In fact, it is not uncommon to see small groups of allies who support each other with their peculiar skills and emerge victorious from clashes that otherwise would have been lethal in singles. Small note, in the shop it is possible to notice a fourth class not yet available: in our opinion it will be a sort of Tank, which in fact is missing. Modes and equipment egg hatching is one of the most welcome additions We can be satisfied with the offer at the release of Century: Age of Ashes in terms of game modes. We have the possibility to choose between three of them, always divided into two teams of 6 players that differ not only in the maps, but also in the purpose. In Gates of Fire we will have to collect a flag in the center of a predominantly mountainous scenario and we will have to be able to cross as many gates as possible, delimited by beams of light, trying to pass more than our opponents. In Carnage mode, however, we will be faced with the evergreen team deathmatch in which within a time limit we will have to score more kills than the opposing team. In this mode we will also have bonuses such as Bounties, referring to players who have done more kills and which give a higher score in case of killing, or the Drakepiercer, an object that once collected will give the possibility to kill with a just blow our opponent. The map in this case consists of a ruined castle on the edge of a large frozen lake at sunset, very suggestive. In Spoils of War mode finally whereWe will be able to recover and store more gold than the opposing team in our headquarters. We will be able to obtain it both from the dragons (yes, these are normal dragons) transporters, hitting and killing them to then collect the abandoned gold, or by recovering one of the gems that appear randomly within the map which will guarantee us 5 gold units per second as well as 300 units if we will hold it at the end of the battle. Or even carrying a bomb inside the enemy headquarters and detonate it, thus giving our team the opportunity to collect half of the gold forfeited by the enemy team. The game map of this mode is divided into two specular areas with as many fortresses and in the center a sort of large castle with tunnels and towers between which to twirl, all seasoned with a large lake below. In fact there is a fourth 3vs3 mode called Skirmish which is unlocked once you reach level 5, in which we will simply find ourselves at the center of a terrible storm and we will have to take down as many opponents as possible by the end of time. The latter is undoubtedly the most successful map of the four indicated. The character design of Century: Age of Ashes is excellent There are several ways to unlock wyverns and cosmetic items for our knights. One of them allows you to unlock everything simply by playing and we will have to play a lot to get to level 100 of the first battle pass, the threshold at which it is possible to unlock a legendary egg. Yes, because also in this title there is the sacrosanct division of loot into common, rare, epic and legendary, both in terms of cosmetic elements and wyverns. The latter can be obtained in two ways: by directly unlocking the adult dragon, or by obtaining one of the aforementioned eggs and hatching it until our little one is born and raised. To ensure that our egg becomes an adult wyvern we will have to meet combat requirements such as hitting opponents with the final moves a certain number of times or dodging bullets about ten times and so on. Unfortunately, that's all. each mode has only one map available and in addition, once you reach level 10, the classifieds are unlocked, which, for now, are the sore point of the production. Ranking up can only be done in Ranked Spoils of War, there is no other mode. This inevitably leads to a basic repetitiveness which we trust will be resolved in the shortest possible time. Technique and gameplay From a stylistic point of view, animations, textures and lighting, the Playwing guys have done a small miracle. Every single detail of the (few) maps is really well cared for, reflections, particle sound design and map design are refined and decidedly pleasant. Just the sound sector deserves a separate applause. The music is evocative, powerful and always pressing when needed. At times they reminded us of those of God of War and Skyrim, you understand well that the creeps are therefore at home here too. We have left for last one of the fundamental aspects of this Century: Age of Ashes and that is its playability. Here too we must congratulate the developers as, pad in hand, after about ten games, our dear wyverns did exactly what we wanted. The controls are simple, basically you pick up speed, slow down and shoot, moving in all possible directions. It seems like a small thing, but the development team has managed to give weight to every single movement of the animals, with different visual and command responses depending on the rider's solicitation; we have even seen the wyverns almost complaining about the sudden changes of direction, truly remarkable. Another fundamental aspect of the gameplay is the speed, rendered wonderfully especially during the dives from great heights, with a motion blur that gradually increases giving the impression of being very fast. We will have 4 shots available to use which, once exhausted, will have to be recharged by crossing the light blue strips scattered around the maps. Thanks to this mechanic, escaping from the most difficult situations will always require interesting resource management and a little more tactics.", "date": "2021-12-13", "grade": "8.5"}
