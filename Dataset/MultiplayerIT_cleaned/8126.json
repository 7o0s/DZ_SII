In light of all this, however, how many of you would have expected the landing of MOBAs on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3? The Monoliths have taken up the challenge of shaping a game with the peculiar characteristics of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, trying to adapt them to the needs of the community of console players and their different approach to the game compared to the historical base that has made it grow the genre on PC with big names like DOTA 2 and League of Legends. Guarding Middle-earth Carrying out the ambitious Guardians of Middle-Earth project at Monolith Productions, there was the intention of making MOBA gameplay as usable as possible, even to a user who had never before related to this type of game. This genre is characterized by frenetic and chaotic action, where the player is led to think fast and act even faster. For the less accustomed to this reality we are talking about a type of multiplayer game where players play heroes (here called Guardians) with numerous unique abilities and different classes, supported by minor units generated and controlled by the cpu. The goal of the games is to advance along the maps with one or more paths to get to destroy the base, or rather the opponent's tower, in the event of a stalemate, the team that has scored the most points at the end of the time will win. For a MOBA to be enjoyable to play, it is absolutely necessary that the balance between the numerous units and the related skills are perfectly balanced, so as not to create imbalances or overly advantaged classes and the result which in this case has been fully achieved. With Guardians of Middle-Earth we wanted to streamline the formula, trying to make the games shorter than the classics for PC, and to avoid the creation of those typical situations of eternal stalemate where the two sides are unable to advance thus prolonging the battle for very long times. In fact the matches, albeit well balanced (also thanks to a handy matchmaking function that pairs players based on their level of experience and replaces the missing seats with the cpu in case of excessive waiting) only in rare cases do they last in a excessive and when it happens it is due to the merit and experience of the players who learn not to take unnecessary risks that could jeopardize the achievement of victory. The goodness of the production can be immediately guessed from the splendid characterization of the twenty guardians, divided between the forces of good and darkness but who for purely tactical and balance reasons can be freely selected in the same team thus creating unusual mixed armies, without have constraints related to the narrative structure dictated by the books of J. R. R. Tolkien. The selectable characters belong to various classes with different inclinations which it is impossible not to take into account when setting one's own style of play: units more devoted to attacking or supporting companions need diametrically opposite approaches to the game, as it is It is important to compose the most heterogeneous teams since cooperation between players is essential, in fact, like all MOBAs, GoME is not a game made for lone wolves. All within reach The most important work has been done on the engineering of the control system, totally rewritten to allow you to have full control of the action through the pad. This aspect certainly represented the riskiest part of the project of bringing a MOBA to the console, but it must be said that the Monoliths have been able to solve every problem in the best possible way without distorting the gameplay of this genre. Each guardian features a circular aura that represents the range of attacks, this area changes in shape and size based on the selected attack and the character's skill. There are offensive solutions that affect a circular or cone-shaped area, or more targeted attacks that strike in a single direction. To have the greatest possible control of the action, which often reaches considerable frenzy peaks, the right analog stick is used to direct the direction of the attacks, a solution that recalls that of the so-called twin stick shooters, while the right trigger is used to use of the normal attack. Decisive to impose their supremacy in batglia are the skills, which can be recalled with the four front keys of the pad, the mastery of the latter is essential: being familiar with the cooldown times and always knowing which attack or support magic to use without getting caught up in the frenzy of the action are aspects that you quickly learn to take into consideration if you want to be minimally competitive. However, to give the player the possibility to have everything under control, the abilities never have a range too far from the player himself. It is also essential to manage the possibilities of enhancing these skills with knowledge of the facts every time the character levels up in the middle of the clashes, as is the equipment of our guardian which is made up of a belt divided into various sections with the possibility of setting gems that bring numerous bonuses that are activated during the game in a progressive manner. Also noteworthy are some, albeit sporadic, netcode problems that sometimes lead to annoying moments of widespread lag, we hope the developers will intervene soon to optimize this aspect. Xbox 360 goals Guardians of Middle-Earth features 29 objectives for the canonical 400 total points. If the first 50 points will be unlocked practically immediately without any effort, to get the full loot it will be necessary to spend a lot of time online and learn to master each class available as evidenced by the goal which requires you to win 100 online games. The usual road to the Shire In GoME, managing the timing of the battle makes the difference between victory and defeat: understanding when it is necessary to impose yourself by attacking the opposing towers, or stalling to accumulate levels and grow your guardian in view of a subsequent assault, the MOBA games are marked by these decisions and by the coordination between the different character classes. The battlefield also plays a fundamental role in the dynamics of the matches, the same structure with one or three paths to reach the opposing base radically changes the approach to the game. In the presence of only one path, in fact, the matches develop in a frontal clash in the center of the map where the precarious balance of the two armies is the master, where instead there are three paths, it becomes tactically advantageous to go and identify on which front it is more exposed the opponent in a game of continuous front changes and reversals of the balance of power. Sanctuaries are useful for gaining supremacy over the opponents, as they give permanent bonuses to the team in control of them (it is not uncommon to see two or more guardians contending for one of these precious elements of the battlefield), to these are added the barracks from which the support infantry (real cannon fodder from the front line) is generated at regular intervals and the intermediate towers that automatically attack the opposing units, the latter two structures can be improved by higher level guardians. The most obvious limit of the rich offer of Guardians of Middle-Earth lies precisely in the small number of maps, just two: the first with a very linear structure with a single path while the second, larger and more articulated, has three different lanes. What is surprising (or perhaps not surprising) is the fact that DLCs have already been announced which will bring new maps to make up for this lack, but the fact remains that it would have been more than reasonable to expect a greater number of stages already at the exit of the game, without having to be forced to make a further outlay.", "date": "2012-12-10", "grade": "8.0"}
