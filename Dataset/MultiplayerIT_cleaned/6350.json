{"name": "Sfida il futuro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/149542-marvel-future-fight-sfida-il-futuro.html", "text": "Not even a week ago we asked ourselves how the Avengers game we would like should be, and today we are reviewing a possible answer to that question, pronounced by a Korean development team rather well known in the field of freemium productions. Marvel Future Fight actually not only brings the Avengers into play, but also a large number of other superheroes from the House of Ideas, who are faced with the traditional apocalyptic situation: the future is lost, but Nick Fury manages to send a message in the passed by to warn his friends of the imminent threat. The rest is a mixture of exploration, however simple, and fights with purebred super villains (from Ultron to MODOK, from Kingpin to Bullseye, from the Hand ninjas to Doctor Octopus, and so on) but also with evil versions of the same heroes, ~synthesized~ thanks to a system that has analyzed the DNA of the most powerful beings on Earth and aims to use this terrible weapon to destroy them. The structure is typical of dungeon crawlers (a la Dungeon Hunter, to be clear), but the settings are almost all open and there are actually very few treasures to collect. With a view to eight different chapters, divided into various episodes and available at higher degrees of difficulty to allow you to unlock certain objects, Marvel Future Fight in fact focuses on obtaining new characters and new costumes, as well as on strengthening a team made up of three elements (each recallable at will during the action) through the earning of in-game credits and more or less rare bonuses. A solution that works, even more so if you are a fan of Iron Man, Captain America, Spider-Man, Daredevil etc., and which in this case is not affected by an elastic freemium approach, with the traditional energy points that are consumed at each mission but which recharge quickly; and the possibility of actually completing the campaign (or trying your hand at the fun three-against-three multiplayer in the arena) without spending a euro thanks to an honest and transparent difficulty balancing, which does not aim at mere monetization. Marvel Future Fight is a simple but well done action RPG, with lots of characters and items to unlock Who will you choose? Forget the questionable solution recently adopted by NetherRealm Studios for the mobile version of Mortal Kombat X, where you had to deal with completely unknown characters for most of the experience, with the ability to access the ~stars~ only from a certain point onwards (and perhaps putting his hand in his wallet). No, Marvel Future Fight opens the doors of its roster immediately, giving us an initial team composed of Iron Man, Captain America and the Black Widow. The mechanisms that will then lead to the release of new heroes will instead be more ~cautious~, with figures such as Blade (yes, the Vampire Slayer), Sharon Carter and Luke Cage to act as starters before arriving at celebrities such as Spider-Man, Hulk, Daredevil and the powerful Hulkbuster armor, protagonist of a specific event. There are four classes to refer to: combat, i.e. the traditional brawlers, skilled in hand-to-hand combat; explosion, i.e. the ranged, characters who attack from a distance and who perhaps do not resist much counter-offensives; speed, which epitomizes the rogue class, with quick and dashing heroes; and finally ~universal~, i.e. the most balanced option. Once any selection, enhancement and customization operations of the team members have been completed, it will be possible to access the missions and therefore confront a variable number of enemies in an action RPG context, as mentioned. Two distinct touch control systems allow you to enjoy the experience in RTS style or as an action game, in the latter case with a virtual analog stick (which repositions itself with each touch) and some buttons on the right side of the screen, which go used for the standard attack and for the special moves, each regulated by a cooldown but not subject to consumption, as happens instead in many freemium productions. Characterized by detailed and convincing graphics, with only some uncertainty on non-latest generation devices (we tested the game on iPhone 5s) during the most agitated phases, Marvel Future Fight suffers a little too much from its connotation of mobile game, in sense that the missions are short and rather repetitive, the scenarios far from extensive and the enemy AI relatively basic; except for the bosses, which offer a little more challenge.", "date": "2015-05-09", "grade": "8.0"}
