{"name": "Resident Evil: Degeneration", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-degeneration_a.html", "text": "With the imminent release of the fifth chapter of the series for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Resident Evil once again manages to attract the attention of fans and insiders. The release of the CG animated film ~Resident Evil: Degeneration~, in this sense, represents nothing more than the culmination of an operation that over the years has led to the production of three cinematic films with Milla Jovovich. The story takes place after the events narrated in Resident Evil 4. While in the Harvardville airport to receive a family she is helping through the humanitarian organization to which she belongs, Claire Redfield notices something suspicious. Not even the time to make inquiries that chaos breaks out: the whole structure is quickly invaded by zombies due to some people infected by the T Virus, and the girl finds herself trapped in the offices of the structure together with some other survivors. Leon Kennedy, still as a government agent specializing in this type of emergency, is sent to the site to understand what happened and resolve the situation once again. And it is Leon that we will control in this tie-in for Java-compatible devices, within a series of stages that are presented to us as short single missions and which will gradually see us face increasingly serious threats. Let's also say that Capcom has taken the ~portable~ nature of the game very seriously, and in fact the levels always turn out to be very short and simple, with a goal to be achieved which is declared at the beginning and which, once achieved, unlocks the next stage. The plot unfolds mainly thanks to the dialogues between Leon and Ingrid, its connection with the base of operations, and roughly follows that of the animated feature film. Anyone who has tried the 3D version of Resident Evil: The Missions knows well that it is a product that tries to recreate the atmosphere and gameplay of the first episodes of the series, and this Degeneration is no different. We will be able to choose whether to use a control system relative to the character (as per tradition for RE) or relative to the screen, simplifying things, and we will move a polygonal character within 2D scenarios unfortunately far from detailed or evocative. As soon as we face an enemy, we will be able to extract the equipped weapon by pressing the * button and move the d-pad up and down to adjust the aim, preferably looking for the headshot. The 5 key is used to fire, while it is possible to move the shot towards other targets by still acting on the d-pad but pressing it left or right. Keys 7 or 9 allow you to interact with the environment (open doors, for example) and finally keys 1 or 3 activate or deactivate the ride. Moving on to the technical implementation, unfortunately Capcom continues a negative trend that does not do it much credit: while on PC and console it manages to package absolutely extraordinary products, sometimes almost ridiculing the competition, in the mobile sector it has accustomed us to graphically really mediocre titles. In the specific case of Resident Evil: Degeneration, we have discrete polygonal models for the characters, who however move within locations terribly devoid of detail, even ~blurred~. Given that it is the usual marriage between 3D and 2D, it is really strange that the developers have not managed to do better. Finally, the sound is qualitatively discreet but really essential: a few moans, a few shots and little more. PRO Classic Resident Evil gameplay A good number of internships Interesting for fans of the series AGAINST Location ~blurry~ and lacking in detail Cumbersome Short and simple missions, maybe too much", "date": "2009-02-24", "grade": "6.5"}
