{"name": "Brothers in Arms - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brothers-in-arms-recensione.html", "text": "From the Alps to the pyramids, from Manzanares to the Reno. Brothers in Arms proves to be blunt and honest right from the start: it doesn't climb windows in search of a story - a new point of view - from which to observe the Second World War once again, it limits itself to inserting the players in the context of the conflict, dividing the gaming experience into three macro-sections set in Normandy, Tunis and the Ardennes. The game is structured like a classic first-person shooter in wartime: in the wake of great battles, the camera is focused on a small handful of heroes who fight to complete a series of missions capable of promoting the advance of allies. The three campaigns are absolutely independent of each other, with the only point in common limited to the actual deployment of the players, always in favor of the allies; each is subsequently divided into sub-missions linked together by a well-defined common thread in terms of story, but which appear to be quite varied in terms of the gaming experience offered: the player's task can go from garrisoning an outpost, passing for the sniping mission to end up driving a tank by wiping out every single moving pixel on the screen. The adventure does not allow particular customizations both in terms of game difficulty and in terms of choosing one's war path (the game always and only starts from the Normandy campaign), ~forcing~ the player to complete the campaigns to unlock the next ones. In addition to the usual mode dedicated to the campaign, Brothers in Arms allows you to take part in single missions (as long as you unlock them by progressing through the game) and even challenge each other in multiplayer with three other players equipped with cartridges within the classic FPS rules: deathmatch , time race and points race. Tactile fire If from the premises Brothers in Arms risks falling into oblivion due to the lack of originality in the ideas, it is when the real adventure begins that the game shows all its hidden potential. The first thing that catches the eye is undoubtedly the incredible graphic rendering: Gameloft have managed to squeeze the 3D potential of the DS to the maximum, creating an absolutely valid product and inferior only to Metroid Prime Hunters; soldiers run frantically on the screen, buildings explode and the crawlers advance relentlessly. Without going into detail, the developers have managed to give the game a really convincing graphic look, able to convey the feeling of being in the middle of a world conflict. An excellent graphics sector is accompanied by an equally excellent control system, probably the true strength of BiA. The game is in fact structured by intelligently exploiting the potential of the DS: the only controls that go beyond the use of the stylus are linked to the movement of the character with the directional cross and to the left backbone used to shoot (the configuration is ~mirrorable~ also for left-handed people, who can move with the four buttons and shoot with the right back), while the stylus on the touch screen has been assigned a function very similar to that covered by the mouse in FPS on PC, i.e. moving the weapon on the screen; the rest of the commands - which can always be activated using the touch screen - are linked to the possibility of selecting the weapon to be used in combat (just scroll through a list of images of weapons), to the use of the ~zoom~ function essential in the sniping phases, the selection of particular commands (indicated graphically by the drawing of a fist) such as, for example, attaching bombs to machinery and getting on/off from cars and armored vehicles, and finally the important launch of grenades and smoke bombs, which can be used scrolling the nib along an energy bar to determine the launch width of the weapon (aided by a very practical ground target that indicates the launch area). To the colorless elements such as those related to the plot and the missions and to the much more exciting ones deriving from the gaming experience, however, there are also other decidedly negative ones in the final calculation of the product. The element of difficulty is probably one of the most obvious weak points of the game: in addition to the actual low difficulty of the game (so much so that it is difficult to get killed), the excessive signals relating to where to move within the level (reducing all almost at a tutorial stage) and finally not being able to select the difficulty level, certainly represent a block for the more savvy and expert players, forced to have to finish the game at least once a whileter start all over in hard mode. Combined with this element, the excessive brevity of the entire adventure should be underlined, a defect certainly the result of both the poor game calibration and the few ideas in terms of game design. However, the road has now been traced and all that remains is to find the courage to retrace it again, perhaps armed with fresh ideas and an original background. The quality of Brothers in Arms is beyond doubt. Gameloft have found the courage to go one step further than all other fellow developers, making a game with solid 3D capabilities combined with an intelligent control structure. Unfortunately, the defects related to longevity and excessive simplicity remain evident, defects that are certainly more easily overcome in the near future. For Gameloft, the first big step is done. Pros: Excellent graphic rendering Comfortable and effective control system Multiplayer with interesting implications Cons: Definitely too simple ... ... and short The context is too clich The gamers of recent years are all war veterans, and more precisely multi-veterans of the first and second world wars. Ormi every lover of the FPS genre can also consider himself a historian in all respects, having fought the ~great~ wars on the side of the Poles, the Germans, with the British, the Russians, the Italians, the French and the Americans. This strange phenomenon has unfortunately not been caused by the arrival on the market of a couple of strong titles linked to the theme of world wars, but rather by a real flood of games that have raged and exploited every single moment of the two wars in order to succeed to find new pretexts and new starting points. Call of Duty and Medal of Honor are just two of the brands used to exploit this phenomenon, a phenomenon which - it must be said - had not yet looked at Nintendo's dual-screen console, by all (developers included) erroneously considered as a portable suitable only for puzzle games, graphic adventures and the most diverse animal simulations. Gameloft, now Ubisoft's developer partner for the DS (they are the developers of Asphalt Urban and the transposition of Splinter Cell Chaos Theory), has rolled up its sleeves and decided to make the most of the 3D capabilities of the dual-screen console Nintendo, pulling out of the hat an unexpected and welcome first-person shooter named Brothers in Arms.
