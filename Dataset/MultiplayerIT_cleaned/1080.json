Today we're finally here to tell you about it properly, with all the necessary attention to the plot because it's okay that it has its years on its shoulders but, precisely because of its scarce availability, few know it and it wouldn't be right to ruin it for you. On the contrary, we are surprised to have seen him cross his native borders after so long and grateful that it happened, since just as the two chapters that make up the series were very beautiful at the time, they still are today, strong in a total artistic reinterpretation and a dubbing unreleased. So here is the review of Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir & The Girl Who Stands Behind. Two supernatural visual novels Famicom Detective Club consists of two chapters, the second of which is actually a prequel. In The Girl Who Stands Behind we learn about the protagonist (whom you can give any name you want) and how he came into contact with investigator Shunsuke Utsugi - becoming his assistant. The story revolves around the investigation into the death of a high school girl, a seemingly simple case ready to evolve into a much bigger situation than one might have thought; in support, the events take a strange supernatural turn due to the rumors about the specter of a girl who haunts the school where the victim studied. Between intrigues and twists, our young but intuitive protagonist will have to recognize the truth beyond the lies, digging into a murky past that seems to hide the answers he needs. The Missing Heir is set after these events and sees the boy waking up at the foot of a cliff, with no memory of himself. Soon he will be involved in another mysterious case, that is to investigate a complex murder case among the ranks of a wealthy family, in a village that hides too many secrets. It seems that an ancient curse weighs on the Ayashiro but is it true? Or is it just rumors spread to keep the curious away? It will be up to you to find out, aware that often it is not the dead you have to worry about but the living. From the past to the present A scene from Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir As we anticipated, thirty-three years have passed since the release, only in Japan, of the second chapter of the Famicom Detective Club. We tried the original chapters, before starting this remake, and we must recognize its genuine beauty: especially as regards The Girl Who Stands Behind, whose SNES reissue we played and which involved almost the entire team behind ~Super Metroid~. Legendary pixel artist Tomoyoshi Yamane supervised the 16-bit version of the game which, to all intents and purposes, we can consider as the first remake: the static screens that told the story had become animated and so rich in detail that it didn't seem place even today. The audio sector itself benefited from it, in particular because Kenji Yamamoto was finally allowed to fully realize the ideas he had at the time: as composer of the original he knew well what he wanted but above all what the game needed to convey its atmosphere and was able to make excellent use of the potential of the SNES. There are tracks like Reasoning 2 (from The Girl Who Stands Behind) which are not only a tribute to the Goblins and Dario Argento, the latter a source of inspiration for the author Yoshio Sakamoto - remember, at his first writing job with this series - but they make you feel part of the events in an instant. Famicom Detective Club, Ayumi Tachibana and the protagonist We find this same quality, visual and musical, in the remake for Nintendo Switch, which indeed enhances The Missing Heir then confirming the already excellent quality of The Girl Who Stands Behind. The technical sector adopted is absolutely first-rate, with an anime aesthetic that makes it modern, proving to be very elaborate and with attention to detail: if you are a fan of visual novels, you will know that the trend is to ~animate~ the characters through the banging of eyelids or sudden changes in expression. In this sense, Famicom Detective Club goes further and presents real animations, which although they may seem artificial at times, overall offer a valuable final result, to the point of making us hope to be able to seriously see the animated staging. Really not we would have expected, even more so for games of over thirty years ago, a cure that went beyond the simple re-proposition (such as forexample was for Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon & The Blade of Light, which proved to be a rather lacking operation). If only for this, together with an equally well-finished dubbing that involved a respectable cast and a soundtrack whose tracks adapt to every situation making the gameplay more alive, Famicom Detective club should be given that possibility which so far, for obvious reasons, he was denied. The only obstacle, nowadays, could be the language: in fact, the game does not include the Italian localization, so you will have to rely on the English one - which, for a visual novel and someone who doesn't know it, could be a problem. However, the texts are easy to understand and never too loaded to the point of making you lose the thread of the narrative. A bit too old gameplay Famicom Detective Club gameplay To benefit least from this restyling is the gameplay because, quite simply, it is identical to that of 1988-89. He undoubtedly had the merit of pioneering the genre, experimenting with solutions that would then be improved over time, and for this reason it is quite anachronistic if not in conflict with the flow of an otherwise very fluid narrative. Being an investigative visual novel, in Famicom Detective Club we read a lot but we investigate just as much: we can examine the scenes in search of clues, talk to potential witnesses, reflect among ourselves on what the next step might be (this sometimes works as a prompter on how to proceed), show any evidence and above all make good use of our notebook, which contains all the essential information collected during the investigation. During the reconstruction of the case, we will bump into a cumbersome trial & error system which, if in the past it could have been the son of a certain naivety, today it could have been revised: there are literally several points in conversations which, in the absence of a clear direction to take, force us to exhaust all the possibilities available to us; or, even worse, to try the same option several times so that this opens the door and allows us to continue. It wouldn't be a bad thing, if there were a way to orient yourself in the staging and understand where you want to go with this. However, this is often not the case and the game encounters frustrating stall moments, in which we think we have done everything and yet something is still missing that we have no idea about. Sometimes, however, we dwell too much on the obvious and once again we are required to follow precise steps despite the fact that the solution is before our eyes. Sorry that Famicom Detective Club didn't want to modernize this part too, in the face of an excellent technical review and a properly cleaned interface; nevertheless, we invite you to go beyond this stumbling block and enjoy two classics of Nintendo history that have finally had, albeit not entirely, justice.", "date": "2021-05-12", "grade": "8.0"}
