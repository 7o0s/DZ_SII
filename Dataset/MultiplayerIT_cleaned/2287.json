Well, let's take a look at this new baby from EA, eagerly awaited by the community of enthusiasts at least as much as SH2 itself, promoted with flying colors by yours truly not long ago. Let's start by saying that the time frame in which Sub Command is placed is not the same as the title of the Ultimation (World War II), but fits into the present day, with all the consequences of the case. In fact, instead of noisy diesel ~tubs~ a few tens of meters long, in SC we have the possibility of piloting the most advanced (and armed) nuclear submarines launching missiles that the American and Soviet navies have given birth to in recent decades, from the Cold War onwards. We are talking about the Russian submarine Akula class Typhoon (remember Red October?) and the corresponding Yankee class 688(I)-Los Angeles and Seawolf. What appeals to you? Or do you feel lost? Not bad, it's not certain names and unappetizing technical specifications that you will have to worry about to appreciate this game (while for the hungriest I recommend this site). But let's see how it must feel inside such a giant of almost 10,000 tons. Is the B license enough? To ~carry~ a submarine of this size certainly not, and not even a plane, as the 883 said. Yet the fact of piloting such modern means could lead those accustomed to the old (and more easily simulated) submarine boats of 50 years ago to induce , of being faced with something that even a child would be able to drive without danger. After all, here we have state-of-the-art supercomputers, electronic instruments of all kinds and the longed-for torpedo autoguiding system available, while in titles such as Silent Hunter it was necessary to damn oneself with paper and pencil to carry out trigonometric calculations and similar amenities to be gratified by the flambet of own target (the torpedo, once launched, went straight on its way and if it hit something it was certainly not thanks to it). Unfortunately however, the learning curve of Sub Command is more like a cliff than a climb. The number of indicators, buttons, counters, warning lights, lights and various pinzillaccheri is simply unsettling and at first glance the impression is that of having climbed onto a UFO. Is the B license enough? Furthermore, we are not dealing with small and fast vessels with rapid responses to commands, but we are at the helm of something decidedly more akin to a whale than a ~shark~, as the Russian name Akula would like to imply. The purpose of missile-launching nuclear submarines is not to chase and prey on the smallest fish, but rather their specialty consists in moving silently, becoming invisible, perhaps even stopping for days on the seabed, and then stealthily approaching the coasts of some country to park on it, undisturbed, a number of Tomahawk missiles with nuclear warheads. This is the setting of this game, which may not please action fanatics, but on the other hand it is the only one capable of ensuring simulation rigor. Naturally there will be firefights with other enemy ships and submarines (think that the Seawolf class submarines were born as a strategic anti-submarine vessel), but taking into account the immense tonnage of these boats, it is useless to repeat that their most powerful weapon remains silence~. BUT..(there is always a but) Try as I might (I'm mean, I know) at first I just couldn't find a flaw in Sub Command. Agreed, the learning curve is excessively high, but it is still a obstacle that can be overcome with a little constant application and for the enthusiast the problem does not arise at all. The time compression system is actually not very efficient, allowing you to accelerate the passing of the hours up to a maximum of 10 times (against the 400 and more of Silent Hunter2 which was even excessive in this respect), forcing the unfortunate player to starvation engaged in long waits for the most varied reasons or who need to travel a constant route for a few (virtual) days in a row. But after all these are flaws that cannot influence too much the overall judgment that can be given to a simulation that makes the player's patience its primary requirement. Suddenly, however, I noticed an interesting option called Show Truth. As you know, in this kind of simulations there is almost always a tactical map that shows the geography of the area in which we find ourselves, our position and that, more or less approximate, of the enemies sighted, or rather of the ~contacts~ rtaken from the tools. BUT..(there is always a but) What makes Sub Command extremely difficult for novice players is precisely the difficulty in identifying the distance and direction of the opposing vessels, so as to be able to take the right countermeasures in time. By activating the infamous Show Truth option, the exact coordinates of each enemy will appear on the tactical map, making the use of the tools perfectly useless, as to hit a target it will be more than enough to make a trivial estimate of direction and speed based on the data provided directly from the map. It is clear that in this way the simulation rigor disappears at the best shores, to use a very politically correct expression, and the game ends up not offering the slightest challenge. I can understand the desire to make the game accessible even to non-experts, but such a solution would rather be worthy of a cheat, rather than an ~in-game~ option. If you want dispassionate advice, pretend the little Show Truth button doesn't exist at all. Arrived in port safe and sound? In conclusion, I can only be satisfied. Sub Command is a game that playfully simulates an almost unexplored aspect of the universe of submarines and apart from the aforementioned slip-up, I would say that it succeeds admirably. Add to this a decent graphic, clean and realistic, with a decidedly more refined engine than those to which we are accustomed to this genre of games, and an atmospheric sound, never annoying or over the top. Certainly the fans will not be disappointed, and to those who ask me whether it is better to buy Silent Hunter2 or the SC here, I reply that they are profoundly different titles and that if possible I would try to have both. Otherwise, I would still lean towards Sub Command, given the greater completeness and scope of the simulation. After all, greater difficulty means greater satisfaction! It seems that submarine simulations are having a really good time, judging by the fact that this end of 2001 saw the release of this Sub Command on the shelves after the excellent Silent Hunter2, both belonging to a genre that it would be euphemistic to define as complex and unappealing to the average gamer. But if you're currently reading my free-range prose, it means that after all the topic attracts you, so let's ban the clichs and let's get into it.", "date": "2002-01-07", "grade": null}
