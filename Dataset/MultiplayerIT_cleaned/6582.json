Here, forget it and forget that way of making companion apps, because Evolve: Hunters Quest is so much more than that. In fact, we are not faced with a simple game, perhaps very limited, which exploits the popularity of the franchise to which it refers to collect downloads and perhaps sell a few packs of coins via in-app purchase, but a mix of puzzles and strategy of great value, capable of giving a jolt to a genre that had been resting on its laurels for too long waiting for the next Puzzle Quest; or the advent of Puzzle & Dragons, to stay on topic. From the point of view of a single player campaign consisting of over one hundred levels, divided into four chapters that must be unlocked one at a time, our task in the game will be to lead the Hunter team protagonist of the Turtle Rock Studios title in a long joke of hunting, facing both the hostile creatures that populate the planet Shear and the monsters, the real ones: Goliath, Kraken, Wraith and Behemoth. All within a system that certainly refers to that of the aforementioned Puzzle Quest, with the combat in the upper part of the screen and the traditional match-3 style puzzle game in the lower part, but introducing a series of strategic elements that make the product much more than any clone. In fact, to win you need to plan your moves in the best possible way, look for the most effective combo and gradually increase the indicators of each Hunter, so as to be able to take advantage of their special attacks. Evolve: Hunters Quest certainly represents an exception to the rule when it comes to companion apps Monsters are serious business The structure of Evolve: Hunters Quest is based on matches that develop within increasingly complex ~turns~, at the end of which we may have to face one of the giant monsters. As already mentioned, the gameplay takes its cues from the classics of the genre and asks us to match elements of the same color at the bottom of the screen, with each Hunter matching a hue. This means, for example, that composing combos with red blocks will result in an attack carried out by the Assault class towards the target we have selected, and that at the same time this operation will raise the three-phase indicator placed next to the health bar. character's life energy. Each stage corresponds to a different special attack linked to the peculiarities of the class, therefore always in the case of the Assault we will have a barrage of miniguns, the use of the flamethrower or grenades, while a hybrid class such as the Medic will be divided between a shot of rifle accuracy to the ability to heal a teammate. The interesting thing is that all eight Hunters that we will see in Evolve are present in the game, each with its own repertoire of moves, which will lead us to change our approach when, passing from one chapter to another, we will have to dealing with a different team. However, what makes the action particularly engaging is the degree of difficulty, far from trivial but completely unrelated to monetization logic: in Evolve: Hunters Quest there are no traditional ~action points~, which means that it is possible to play for hours without any limit, and in-app purchases are limited to the possibility of buying upgrades that make it easier to pass certain missions or continue to game over rather than starting the stage over. Technically, a good job has been done, using naturally simplified polygonal models compared to those of the game arriving on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and adding to the whole a sound sector that includes the voices in Italian. The result is visually pleasing and does its job well.", "date": "2015-02-07", "grade": "8.5"}
