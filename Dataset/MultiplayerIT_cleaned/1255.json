{"name": "Katamari Damacy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/katamari-damacy.html", "text": "The charm of idiocy Katamari Damacy introduces the player into its delirious world thanks to a demented narrative plot to say the least. With considerable carelessness, the king of the universe Ousama involuntarily destroyed the stars that populate the firmament, finding himself forced to send his tiny son Ouji to earth to collect a sufficient amount of ~stuff~ useful to recreate the shattered stars again. Stuff, exactly. Because the gameplay of the Namco title is resolved precisely in the accumulation of objects through a magic sphere supplied by the intrepid Ouji. The user's task is to roll the ball within the various scenarios that make up the game, collecting with it the elements useful for one's cause (read: anything) simply by passing over it. Simple? Stupid? Fun? Katamari Damacy, incredibly, is all of this. An explosive mix composed of a basic but absolutely brilliant play structure, filled with a healthy dose of demented humor and definitively consecrated by a gameplay of the ~I play one more game and then I stop~ type gameplay. In a word, irresistible. Also because, similarly to what happens in Wario Ware for Game Boy Advance, we find ourselves struck by a product that is only apparently frivolous and light, but which turns out to be as fun as few once you take the pad in hand. Pad of which, moreover, Katamari Damacy exclusively uses the two analog sticks, dedicated to (perfect) control of the sphere, and two back keys useful for switching to a bird's eye view or in first person. Everything in the Namco title has been designed to allow anyone to immediately become familiar with the game. However, this does not mean that Katamari Damacy is an overly simplistic product, on the contrary: the collection of ~stuff~ does not result in a trivial race against time, but also requires a pinch of strategy and overview. First, it is not possible to glue any type of object to the ball from the beginning, but it is necessary to make an increasing path, starting with the smallest elements and continuing with the larger ones, as the sphere is covered with more things. disparate. Virtually every component of the vast scenarios is in fact vulnerable to the advance of Ouji, when his ball has a diameter greater than or equal to that of the desired target. And it is at least exhilarating to observe the little protagonist of the game begin his journey by incorporating common small / medium-sized objects and then continue gradually and end up investing people, cars, houses and even planes and Ferris wheels, making the ball reach dimensions in order of hundreds of meters. Moreover, the accumulation of ~stuff~ on the sphere involves significant variations in the physics of its movement, which becomes progressively less regular in its rolling and consequently more difficult to control. Katamari Fortissimo Damacy The Katamari Damacy scenarios can boast a considerable planimetric extension, which in any case necessarily relates to the dimensions of the sphere required as the final objective of the stage. In cases where the order of magnitude is measured in centimeters, therefore, we will find mostly home environments, with Ouji engaged in raiding objects scattered between rooms, attics, gardens and so on, while in the more advanced levels the player will find himself engaged to roll within entire towns. In any case, the elements of the scenario are not thrown at random, but placed with criteria, so as to urge the user to adopt a minimum of strategy to collect as much ~stuff~ as possible, avoiding downtime or unproductive walking. It must also be said that the Namco title also features a series of special missions, in which the collection of objects is subject to certain criteria: sometimes it is necessary to incorporate only a certain type of elements of the same type in order to reconstruct the constellations relative, still others you have to avoid touching certain components of the scenario, and so on. At the same time crazy and ingenious as regards the game structure, Katamari Damacy does not fail to respect this dualism also in terms of technical realization. Graphically, the Namco title certainly cannot be defined as impressive, but nevertheless it has a unique style, frequently able to elicit more than a smile. Starting from the character design (Ouji himself, with his ballets and his expressions, is simply irresistible), passing through the delirious ~cubed~ interlude sequences and the illustrations of the packaging, everything in the Namco product exudes a demented charm that is hardly can leave you indifferent. egAs for the game itself, the minimalist look dominates unchallenged, making the world of Katamari Damacy similar to a scenario built with lego, with hilarious implications to say the least about the modeling of some characters (see for example the students with tufts preposterous or Yakuza mobsters with toy guns). As for the sound sector, Katamari Damacy deserves applause once again: in addition to the hilarious sound effects that populate the game (in particular the anthology screams of people who are engulfed by the sphere), the Namco title presents a column sound that shines not only for quality and variety, but above all for the ability to fix itself inside the player's mind. And therefore, among very catchy pop, mambo, swing, electronic and more, it is not surprising that, at the end of the game session, you find yourself humming these same melodies ... Comment A bolt from the blue. Katamari Damacy is the game you don't expect, perhaps one of those that in the preview phase is immediately cataloged within the category of ~stupid~ games for Japanese. Then we end up with a brilliant title: simple but incredibly fun, never boring, with a unique graphic style, a killer soundtrack and an exaggerated amount of demented humor. And one bitterly regrets one's prejudices. Burdened exclusively by a certainly not excellent longevity, Katamari Damacy is a surprising title, capable of giving moments of pure videogame hilarity. Pros: Fun and immediate like few others Graphics and atmosphere at the peak of insanity Exceptional soundtrack Cons: Not exaggerated longevity Currently only available in jap version In a period in which video games have now become products with a very complex structure, it is always quite surprising, if not completely unsettling, to find titles that make simplicity and immediacy their appeal. Let's take this Katamari Damacy by Namco, for example: how do you feel about a game that sees the user engaged in rolling a ball using only the analog sticks in an attempt to collect as much stuff as possible? But love at first sight, of course.", "date": "2004-07-11", "grade": null}
