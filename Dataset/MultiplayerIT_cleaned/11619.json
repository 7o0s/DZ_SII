{"name": "Contra 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/contra-4.html", "text": "Released in arcades at the end of the 80s and immediately converted for gaming systems of that period, Contra is certainly one of Konami's historic video games. The couple of protagonists of this action game deliberately took up the traits of the most famous action movie actors (in this case Stallone and Schwarzenegger), and proposed a very simple plot: there is an alien invasion, two heroes stand up to defend Earth and must single-handedly defeat the extraterrestrial army. To succeed in the enterprise, they will be able to use a large number of weapons, each with a different fire mode. In this mobile version, Contra 4 takes up the structure of the first episodes, with the only exception of the extra sections, in which the view and controls often changed. The game is immediately engaging and immediate, thanks to the developers' choice to resort to automatic fire: given the continuous need to move and jump, having to activate weapons with a separate button would have been, honestly, impossible. There are seven stages, each divided into three sections and topped off with a final boss. Generally we move to the locations horizontally, but variations on the theme have also been included, and so sometimes we will find ourselves having to go up the stages using not only the jump but also the grappling hook. Every now and then we will see small ships fluttering, which once hit will release weapon upgrades: we have two slots available, so we will be able to choose how many and which varieties of fire to use. Taking the same power-up twice results in a more powerful shot, although unfortunately it is difficult to succeed in the enterprise (once you die, you lose the conquered weapons). Shoot'em-up enthusiasts will not fail to notice the lack of any ~smart bomb~, which probably would have made the game even easier than it already is due to the infinite ~continues~ and the possibility to start a game from any internship you have already achieved previously. The only addition to weapons, besides the grappling hook, is an energy shield that can withstand enemy fire for a few seconds. As for the bosses, as usual they move and attack following a predefined pattern, in some cases extremely simple: to eliminate them, just study their moves for a few seconds, then behave accordingly... Technically, we are dealing with a product halfway between the old and the new generation of mobile video games. The sprites have a good animation, but they are really tiny and you have to hold the screen quite close to be able to play, also because otherwise you wouldn't distinguish the bullets to dodge. The scenarios are built with often repetitive graphic elements, but boast a two-level parallax scrolling and a background that is always well made, sometimes even evocative. Unfortunately they don't shine for the design, understood as arrangement and construction: sometimes they are too short, sometimes they can be reached by ignoring some enemies beautifully. The use of colors is very good. The sound sector gives us the possibility of listening to the music or the effects: in the first case, the developers have done a good job, with quite catchy songs, capable of accompanying the action effectively; in the second case, unfortunately, things are diametrically opposite, as the effects are few and far between. As anticipated, some choices made about the control system have proved to be excellent: not having to worry about fire, we will be able to move around the levels and avoid enemies without problems, even if our terminal has a mediocre joystick. PRO Playable, immediate, fun It's Contra Well designed stages... AGAINST ...but sometimes too simple and short Very, very small sprites It is completed with a few attempts", "date": "2008-02-18", "grade": "S.V."}
