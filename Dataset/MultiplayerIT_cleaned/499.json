{"name": "Battle of Europe: Royal Air Forces - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battle-of-europe-royal-air-forces-recensione.html", "text": "16 different missions await us, more or less faithful reconstructions of battles that actually took place Arcade or Simulation? Ferrari It must be emphasized that Battle of Europe is far from the simulation models of Combat Flight Simulator and the like. BoF compares much better to those arcade-style dogfight titles like the very recent Blazing Squadrons or Heroes of the Pacific. These titles with a hybrid nature certainly have their audience and their niche of users but they hardly manage to completely conquer the lovers of hard and pure simulations who consider these products too simplistic for their tastes while the aficionados of hit and run shooters have usually a similar but opposite reaction. The fact remains that within its sub-genre, Battle of Europe, despite being a production proposed since the first release at a budget price, does not look bad compared to the previously mentioned titles and the level design of the 16 missions presents a good variety of situations to face . The limits of Battle of Europe, in addition to the aforementioned lack of multiplayer, are more evident in the technical realization. The production of Black Bean Games stands at discrete levels given that no element affects in any way the playful experience in the strict sense and in any case we see the commitment of the programmers of Maus Software, for example, to reconstruct some of the cities in which the games take place battles such as Berlin, London, Stockholm, Dunkirk and Dublin. The problem is that elements such as the quality of the textures, the light effects and the number of polygons on the screen remain at levels typical of the productions of a few years ago and are certainly not comparable to the best things seen in recent months on PC. From this point of view, the choice to offer it from its first release at a reduced price is better understood and as such, such an audiovisual quality is much more justified. At least, however, BoF does not expect exorbitant hardware requirements at all, so much so that the recommended configuration is indicated in 2 GHz for the processor, 512 MB of ram and 128 MV of video memory. the limits of Battle of Europe, in addition to the aforementioned lack of multiplayer, are more evident in the technical realization In addition to the aforementioned secret missions and the presence of a numerical score that will directly influence the complexity of the following levels, Battle of Europe also offers a nice digital encyclopedia of the over 150 aircraft in the game which, however, increase the ~vintage~ glamor rate a little of the production of Black Bean Games. Final comment Battle of Europe is the classic low budget product (both for production and for the consumer) which, while not presenting a transcendental quality at the same time, does not show major flaws of any kind if we exclude the annoying absence of any multiplayer mode. Typical representative of arcade-style dogfights, in terms of gameplay it does not disfigure at all compared to its predecessors while in terms of audiovisual quality it would have been an excellent title a few years ago BoF is an honest production that will satisfy lovers of its genre reference hybrid and without too many pretensions in technical terms. Pros Pleasant arcade-style dogfights Low price High number of available planes Cons No multiplayer components Merely functional technical implementation Its hybrid nature won't satisfy everyone World War II never ended In the wake of gamers' eternal love for the Second World War, comes from Black Bean Games, Battle of Europe, a title offered at a budget price ( 29.90) which will see us in the role of a Royal Air Force pilot (RAF to be clear) , the British air force that during the second global conflict managed to overwhelm the more numerous Nazi air force. 16 different missions await us, more or less faithful reconstructions of battles that actually took place, while unfortunately we immediately discover the total absence of any multiplayer mode which instead is very suited to the reference genre. Fortunately there are various bonuses, scores and secret missions to unlock that help increase longevity, however not to the highest levels.", "date": "2006-05-24", "grade": null}
