{"name": "Space Pioneer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/space-pioneer-la-recensione-201334.html", "text": "Space, the last frontier: the protagonist of Space Pioneer is an avant-garde astronaut, in the sense that he goes ~where no man has ever gone before~ in order to explore unknown planets, inhabited however in the vast majority of cases by very hostiles, in turn controlled by an evil entity by the name of Xeldar. On the trail of the monster, we will find ourselves involved in a virtually infinite odyssey, which after the first tutorial-style missions meshes well, revealing not only a gameplay that gradually acquires greater depth, but also a structure that becomes more and more multifaceted, adding to the rich progression system (hands-on with the freemium aspects of the experience, which however are tremendously honest in their mild attempt to monetize) a set of special events and a variation on the management theme which, where properly taken care of, ensures the our character a number of undoubted advantages. Fine, but how does the Space Pioneer experience work? Basically the formula is that of a twin stick shooter, although the aiming system is automatic when the targets enter the field of action of the equipped weapon. On the left side of the screen we find a very precise virtual stick, on the right side the fire button and three icons that allow you to throw a grenade, activate a defense turret and finally resort to a medical kit. All require different cooldown times, as in an action RPG, and therefore we must exploit them in the best way, while a drone accompanies us far and wide through the levels, providing us with support. The space that unites us Space Pioneer's action is often frenetic: once projected onto a new planet, we'll have to follow indicators to get in touch with special locations, collect objects or defend devices, creating exciting fights in which we have to move continuously to avoid being hit by increasingly numerous and tough opponents, as well as capable of inflicting massive damage. The formula of the first twenty missions, or so, evolves through the introduction of different objectives, such as small escort missions or explorations that lead to the discovery of certain objects. There is also no shortage of boss fights: we will find ourselves fighting on a regular basis with the aforementioned Xeldar, finding him in better shape every time, equipped with new attacks and movement patterns, but his ~henchmen~ will also not be outdone and will give us hard time. For this reason, the upgrades represent a fundamental factor: between one stage and another we will be able to spend the coins collected and use the cards obtained from the traditional prize boxes to improve the health, speed and attack capacity of the protagonist, but also change his equipment and upgrade his weapons, making them more effective and perhaps less prone to overheating. A factor, the latter, which makes the shooter mechanisms that characterize a large part of the experience decidedly less trivial. As mentioned, the freemium dynamics of Space Pioneer are sensible and generous, with the possibility of spending something to speed up progression and automatically deactivate all advertising trailers, which can however also be used to double the coins or crystals collected, or to get a ~continue~ after a game over and avoid playing the level over again. In short, the system developed by Vivid Games and Game Odyssey works great, is fun and appetizing, and is supported by a valuable technical sector, with a cartoonish style that in some ways recalls the atmospheres of Metroid and, why not, The Legend of Zelda. The musical accompaniment is also excellent, with catchy and effective music.", "date": "2018-06-20", "grade": "8.7"}
