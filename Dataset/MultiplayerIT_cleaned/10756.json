Huge slices of the playing public, after all, approach video games mainly for leisure in peace and therefore devote themselves to a greater extent to experiences capable of entertaining them without weighing too much on their neurons. And let's be clear, similar products are not necessarily anathema to those who appreciate elaborate titles, as skilled developers are able to create games that are as accessible as they are good, or systems layered to the point of being welcoming to all types of users. rarely capable of discerning similar qualities with great precision and therefore it is somewhat difficult to win over the masses, especially when what is offered is not immediately understandable. Of course, some developers have nevertheless run the risk of going against the tide and achieved unthinkable success with video games bordering on the university doctorate, yet following this path usually represents commercial suicide, unless you have a powerful enough marketing machine as a support or some big influencer passed by by chance. Although lacking these ~nudges~, the Ratloop Games have decided to throw themselves into the tumultuous waters of first-person shooters with Lemnis Gate, perhaps convinced that the uniqueness of their creature would have been enough to guarantee him a certain notoriety, then amplified by the always useful presence on Xbox Game Pass. Today, therefore, you will be able to read our review of Lemnis Gate, because we are facing an FPS that is nothing short of unique within the genre, whose concept deserves all the attention in the world and has what it takes to give life to a monstrously competitive fanbase. Be careful though: these ingredients of rare finesse may not be enough to decree the success of the final recipe. Gameplay: A shooter for galactic brains Lemnis Gate: Good aiming is also important here Playing a game of Lemnis Gate allows you to understand its structure undoubtedly better than a written explanation, but we will still try to illustrate its peculiarities as clearly as possible. As mentioned above, it is a ~turn-based shooter~, where each player can choose between various classes - each with a single unique ability and a specific weapon - and each gameplay cycle lasts exactly 25 seconds. The cycles played are memorized and are repeated throughout the game (whose overall ~real~ duration is just 25 seconds) both for you and for the other team, until an overall picture is formed made up of all the actions performed so far. The goal is simply to score points, and this is usually done by completing very clear objectives, such as the conquest or destruction of certain structures through fire damage, or the recovery of some orbs scattered around the map which must then be returned to the own team teleporter (the point from which you spawn on the map at the time of hero selection). Since you play in turns for 25 seconds, you are not dealing with your opponent in real time, so you need to calculate your route as intelligently as possible and adapt your strategy by reacting to your opponent's moves (which can come conveniently observed from above thanks to a drone while not playing). To prevent the enemy from winning, usually the most basic tactic is simply to eliminate his heroes before they get to the objective, but of course doing it in a predictable way makes you an easy target for the enemy's turn, which can make the same thing with you. This leads the game to quickly become a sort of gun chess game, where brilliant plays can reach truly astonishing levels and it's not hard to get caught off guard by crazy strategies. To give you an example, it is possible to have all your characters converge in a single zone during the game, making them incredibly vulnerable in completing objectives, but then protect them all in one fell swoop during the final turn with one of the heroes' deployable energy shield : a quick move that suddenly allows the entire plan put in place in the previous rounds to activate when the opponent was convinced he could act undisturbed. Or again, if you have sufficient knowledge of the map, you can fire preemptively in certain areas with characters equipped with grenade launchers or toxin cannons, to create problems for enemies during the action in anticipation of how they will move, and so on. Particularly good players in the gemanagement of movements and weapons they can even block killings of their characters by placing themselves for a few moments in the enemy's shooting trajectories, or make a massacre by perfectly memorizing their positions and striking with maximum precision. Everything, of course, is made easier by the fact that if a character dies their afterimage remains on the field - still showing their moves after elimination - and even if you are killed by stray bullets you can continue playing in ghost form until end of the round, because it is never certain that in the following cycle those projectiles cannot be deflected or stopped in some way. Contents: How Long Can Genius Last? Lemnis Gate: Klaus, able to place barriers As you can guess, it's a brilliant concept for a title of this type, which allows the most creative and skilled players to indulge themselves. This is not a completely original idea, and it had already been fielded for example by Quantum League (another similar and little-known shooter), but here the presence of the classes and a generally much more refined structure bring everything to the Next Level. Also because heroes who in any other shooter would have been trivial, in Lemnis Gate they quickly become fundamental pieces of the puzzle, the use of which ahead of time can easily cost a game that seemed already won. Ah, to clarify, an already chosen character cannot be reused, so it is very important to choose the most useful one at any given moment. They range from the simple Kapitano, equipped with grenades and automatic rifle, to Klaus, whose aforementioned energy shield can overturn games by stealthily saving a hero condemned in the last round, passing through the positionable turrets of Vendetta, or the super shots of Saetta. Each of these moves can give you a huge advantage in the game if used wisely (for example, Lightning is the best hero ever for quick orb recovery or quick elimination of some targets), and the best part is that Ratloops they seem to have been able to properly balance maps and characters so as not to excessively favor certain strategies. To say, even the Reaper - a sniper capable of slowing down time, which if used and positioned properly can easily eliminate half the opposing team by dint of headshots - is normally limited by a careful positioning of obstacles and objectives (beyond which gives a considerable reload time) which makes it impossible even for the best shooter in the world to abuse it excessively. To understand, the game is even designed to combat the excesses of characters capable of doing a lot of area damage (which some players use to do tabula razed in some areas where you tend to necessarily pass), because friendly damage exists, and blowing up your heroes of future turns is far from difficult if you fire in bulk. The presence of additional modes only rearranges the cards on the table, because in addition to the excellent one against one (which in our opinion is the most successful and balanced mode of the game) there are also two against two matches with alternating rounds, two against two with pairs of players facing the loop at the same time (which are the ones where it's easier to go wrong) and even clashes with simultaneous turns against the enemy, which are fun but tend to be much more chaotic and less reasoned than the others. It's a nice variety of situations, supported by a very structured ranked match system, with various levels of proficiency that are anything but easy to achieve. Lemnis Gate: maps born for tactics There's just one problem: the title is fully multiplayer and its life depends exclusively on the community that decides to support it and on the validity of the matchmaking. Unfortunately, both the latter and the number of contemporary players during our test were disappointing, despite the presence of Ratloop's work on Xbox Game Pass. In the early days matches (ranked or otherwise) were literally not to be found; when the matchmaking was fixed, however, the queues were still often long, with ranked challenges easy to find only by selecting each single type of game. In short, it is not a good start, and it does not bode well for a game that sincerely deserves much more attention from the public given its intelligence. The fact that stylistically Lemnis Gate is really anonymous certainly does not help: it is a fluid and optimized title worthy way, but its plasticky sci-fi look really has no distinguishing element and this aesthetic flatness could further weigh on its future success.", "date": "2021-10-04", "grade": "8.2"}
