We don't know if the Samurai Punk guys had tried it, or maybe had enjoyed GoldenEye in multiplayer on Nintendo 64, the fact remains that the result of their work, although inspired by others, is still genuine. In fact, Screencheat offers a style very similar to the union of the two aforementioned titles, albeit with some nice variations. Screencheat has good ideas and a fun concept, but lacks some depth Under the sunlight In this atypical shooter you can join up to a maximum of four participants, each characterized by a different color; no one can be seen by the others, but everyone is given the opportunity to see, in a box of their screen in splitscreen, the first person view of the opponents. This allows us to identify on the fly where the other players might be, and then reach them, even if a little bit, obviously with the aim of sending them to the creator. To obtain this result we will be able to rely on a firearm, whose most obvious tactic is to shoot into space trying to hit the victim who is in the line of fire, or a less conventional, but equally lethal offensive object , like a candlestick. Only when a target is eliminated will you see his body fall to the ground. In order to prevent this from happening to your alter ego, the most obvious solution is to observe some clearly distinguishable key elements in the opponent's view, generally associated with a single color for the area in which you are moving, knowing that in order to reach farther places you will have the possibility to enter some teleporters. Party game... with the dead Currently the final version of this title offers us to enter its world, colored by the cell shading technique, and to delve into the maps, which will probably be added again in the future, but above all to enjoy some game modes, which however do not have nothing particularly original. The first is the classic Deathmatch where you enter the game and shoot everyone like there's no tomorrow. You can also participate in the Hillcampers variant, in which, as the name suggests, you will have to stay on the ~hill~ in order to win, taking up a nice grenade launcher that helps a lot in the enterprise. For those with a refined palate, we suggest One Shot, a type of game in which you fire a single shot, without the possibility of reloading until the others have fired in turn. Through Capture the Fun we will have to bring our ~flag~ back into a special pinata. In Murder Mystery, on the other hand, the investigative game Cluedo is simulated (very narrowly), as we will have a card that reveals who we will have to eliminate... even if the latter can be seen by everyone and for this reason we will have to pay the utmost attention.", "date": "2014-11-11", "grade": "6.5"}
