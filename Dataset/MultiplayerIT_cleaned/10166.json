Many video games have tried to address the theme by narrating it to focus on specific problems, but growth has hardly been the subject of the game itself. Surely Maxis tried it with the first The Sims, however concentrated on simulating the life of a person tout court, therefore much less focused on single moments of the same. Unfortunately, the series was soon transformed into a kind of doll factory in which the virtual characters have almost completely lost their contact with the original intentions of Will Wright, the author, becoming more of hyper-consumers, whose existence is marked by what they buy, rather than what they are. This is why in the Growing Up review we talk about a game that seemed like a breath of fresh air, despite some major limitations. Question of neurons Growing Up, the brain map What determines who we are? The answer given by Growing Up is quite clear: the sum of the skills, relationships and interests developed during the first eighteen years of life. Developed by a dream team of writers and writers, which includes Daniel Sadowski (Gardens Inc. and Dr. Cares), artist Gracjana Zieliska (Cinders and Solstice), Kacper Kwiatkowski (This War of Mine), Christian Divine (Captain Spirit) , Matthew Ritter (Tales from the Borderlands and Twin Mirror), cartoonist Emma Vieceli (Doctor Who, Back to the Future) and composer Jim Guthrie (Planet Coaster and Reigns: Her Majesty), has a very direct view of the topic : having created a virtual boy or girl, it is necessary to manage his growth by developing his brain map and deciding which activities to carry out during the various shifts that make up his first years of life, leaving the determination of some aspects of his character to social relationships, including gender identity. In our case, we created a little girl and decided to make her a scientist. How to do? The game system is actually very simple: each round you have to carry out two fundamental activities: develop the aforementioned brain map and plan the fundamental activities of the life of the virtual person. The first is basically a big minigame, in which we have to choose which characteristics to favor (empathy, logic, physique, charm, memory and so on) from a map, while accumulating knowledge points useful for unlocking new skills. The player clicks on cells in a large neural network, acquiring their values and unlocking nearby cells. Once the points available for unlocking the cells have run out, you move on to the next phase. It should be noted that at the beginning the management of the brain network is really very simple, but as it grows, variants are added that increase the complexity of the operation (cells that reset the map, others that show the contents of all cells, and so on ) and make each step longer. We then arrive at the planning phase, which is the one in which we have to select the fundamental activities of the shift. These essentially have three purposes: learning new skills, which are used to determine the future work of the offspring; to digress, in order to reduce stress; and work, to earn something to spend in the shops. This is where most other gaming systems come into play. Expectations versus stress Interpersonal relationships are fundamental in Growing Up Growing Up is more complex than it might seem at first glance. Basically it looks like a dating simulator set in the 90s, from which it also takes part of the style of play, from the 2D graphics (well designed) to the dialogues, but in reality there is much more. In fact, our virtual character has two characteristics that must always be considered: his sanity and the satisfaction of parental expectations. The idea is to be able to live keeping the two factors in balance, without therefore going crazy and without displeasing those who gave us life or who adopted us (depending on the type of family). Consider that each activity affects the values of one or both. For example, rambling increases sanity, but reduces parental satisfaction somewhat, while exercising a skill will have the exact opposite effect. Therefore, when planning the fundamental activities, it is always necessary to take into account which values they will touch, adjusting accordingly. In reality, there is another way to influence the life of our virtual character, and that is to spend the action points assigned to each turn to carry out other activities or, more simply, go around spending the money of his pocket money and those he earned by working. Growing byIt becomes possible to explore various places in the city At the beginning of the game, when he is still very small, ours is relegated to his bedroom and, at most, he can go and play in the garden. Growing up, however, he goes to school, of which he can unlock various areas, and in pre-adolescence he can start going around the city in which he lives, going for example to the shopping center, an arcade or a park. Each area visited gives access to different activities and different items to buy. The former are conceptually similar to those of the planning phase (in some cases they are exactly the same) and follow similar rules, while the latter give different bonuses, such as additional slots for the planning phase, sanity bonuses, unlocking certain extra activities and so on. But the variations don't end there. As we said, parents have expectations for their children; these translate not only into the bar we mentioned above, but also into small missions which, if carried out, earn estimate points that can be spent on gifts, such as travel, new clothing or special items. Interpersonal relationships To develop skills you need to practice them, carefully planning them Social relations are also grafted into all this dance of values to be developed or kept an eye on. As is normal, in the course of his life, our character will make acquaintances, with whom he will be able to develop friendships or love relationships. The relationship system is actually very simple and resembles the one seen in many visual novels. In fact, during the game there are dialogues with the other characters in which we have to choose some answers to give or behaviors to keep. In this way we are going to determine the type of relationship we will establish with a certain person. It is here that we will actually be able to determine the gender of our virtual character, stealing with whoever we want or keeping those we don't like at a distance (sometimes even unintentionally). Finally, the various stages of growth are marked by exams, which in reality are simply another mini-game in which we have to accumulate colored gems, spending them on activities that yield a certain number of points. The more points we accumulate, the higher the exam evaluation will be. At the end of the adventure we will be shown a general summary from which we will learn not only our future, but also that of the characters we have met. The scientist who can't read Exams never end Growing Up is, as a whole, successful, but it lacks in some details which it is difficult to overlook, especially if you play it several times as the game system invites you to do to explore the different possibilities. For example, the skills to be developed through exercise have their own logic, but create some strange situations where you can have a fourteen-year-old girl who is passionate about science and tabletop role-playing games, but cannot read, or a philosopher who can't count. Managing sanity and parental expectations then opens up a whole new set of questions and problems. For example, why does gorging on food at a fast food restaurant earn tons of sanity points? Or, why should parents be sorry every time their son or daughter rambles, even in the face of excellent school results? Or again: why does every job lower sanity? We can understand working as a waiter in a restaurant, but selling lemonade in a playground? Why should it have a depressive effect, especially when you're young? As you may have understood, ultimately the major flaw of the Vile Monarch title is the extreme rigidity of the model chosen for the simulation of growth, above all centric USA, which creates contradictory, sometimes absurd situations. For the rest we are faced with a good title, based on a fairly interesting idea, which however could have been explored better.", "date": "2021-11-01", "grade": "7.0"}
