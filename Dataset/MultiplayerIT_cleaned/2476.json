{"name": "Rune: Halls of Valhalla", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rune-halls-of-valhalla_a.html", "text": "Runes and Multiplayer There is probably no need to remind you how much we appreciated Rune here at Multiplayer.it, as it is enough for me to refer you to the games in the Action category to see how the aforementioned title was able to win over the fierce competition. If we had to find a weak point in the game at all costs, and we did, we would have easily identified it in its Multiplayer part, since the few modes offered by the title absolutely did not do justice to the frenetic action of the melee battles that Rune it offered. This was noticed by programmers, even behind the insistence of the large community that had created in the meantime around the game which, after having enjoyed a well-deserved period of rest, dedicated themselves to the programming of this Halls of Valhalla, package of Multiplayer Only expansion. Yes, you read that right: Multiplayer Only. In fact, the first thing to clarify to all fans of the original title is that this expansion does NOT really contain anything for Singleplayer, no new map, no new weapon, no new Rune Power, but above all no small adventure that directly connects to the story of Runes. What can actually be found in this package is essentially the improvement of the multiplayer side of the game, which is thus equipped with two new game modes, new maps and new skins. As for the maps and skins, it must be said that some of them are really very well done: the real doubt concerns their availability on the net, as some sites contain many of them, and even better ones. How many of you would be willing to spend some money, only to discover that the same maps (or skins) are available for free on the net? Posterity will judge... The news The most important innovations that are introduced by this expansion pack concern, as mentioned, the two new game modes: Head-Ball and Arena. Head Ball could be defined as a nice and ironic variant of Basketball, in which the ball is in this case made up of the head of the opponents, which must be placed in a basket of light. In reality, what this mode is clearly inspired by is the Capture The Flag made famous by other titles of the genre (Team Fortess Classic in the first place). Some maps created ad hoc for this new mode have several baskets, and each of them is placed in areas of the map with increasing difficulty: this undoubtedly contributes to increasing the challenge proposed to the players. The main problem of the Head-Ball is composed of a small programming flaw (actually inherited from the original game), since when you manage to kill an opponent and try to take his head close to his body, the character most of the time picks up the weapon in the first place, wasting precious time for the team that could score a point. More entertaining is perhaps the other mode, Arena, modeled according to the requests of the community in the image of the famous beat'em up consolists. In a very small arena, two opposing players face each other with a white weapon, choosing before the fight the weapon with which they will face the enemy, and the shield with which they will defend themselves. Once he has the upper hand in the first match, he will then advance on to the next opponent, in a sort of tournament that will only crown one winner. In a mode of this kind, where the tactical component plays a rather important role, it is not difficult to understand how much the presence of even the slightest Lag pays, since a shot delivered with a microsecond delay can reveal the defense with a ~cut~ opponent's head. On the other hand, the presence of the same Mutators that we have already had the opportunity to appreciate in Unreal Tournament (Fatboy above all) is particularly apt, which allow you to give further customization to the maps: once again, the absence of Bots for the Offline game is inexplicable. Summing up... How much can an expansion be worth that offers what other titles, even less famous ones, offer directly with a download from the Net? Little, very little. If something from Halls of Valhalla were to be saved, it would certainly be the introduction of the two new modes, even if, as I tried to explain in the article, both are of very little weight. If you are a fan of Rune, of its multiplayer part, in this expansion you will find something (not very much, but still something) for your teeth, even if it will be difficult for you to understand why God has decided not to make the expansion free , given its quality, perhaps with the hope that what will happenalready happened with Heart Of Winter (Icewind Dale- the programmers noticed the quality of the package and are about to release the expansion of the expansion for free). If instead of Rune you enjoyed the Singleplayer part, really great, put the dream of continuing the Ragnarok adventure back in the drawer, because you will be very disappointed. Who, if not us at Multiplayer.it could have better appreciated an expansion dedicated exclusively to Multiplayer? But in this case the dish offered is really too poor to praise it (also considering the price at which the expansion will be sold: 60,000 lire), so rejection is rather inevitable: drawing the above sums, it will not be difficult for you have the answer to the question we asked ourselves in the prologue... One last note: the expansion doesn't necessarily require the original game, as it is Stand Alone, but only for the multiplayer. This means that if it finds the Rune installation, it will add the new modes to it, while if it doesn't find it, you will find the Multiplayer part of the game installed, not even the SinglePlayer one, which, still today, offers a very valid gaming experience. Prologue It's always difficult to evaluate a set. For convenience, or more simply for fun, we could try to catalog the expansions in three different categories, in order to create a quick classification that gives us an effective added value from the product to the reference title. In the first category, which we define as ~Oh, My God!~ Cataclysm (Homeworld), Throne of Baal (Baldur's Gate2), Unfinished Business (Jagged Alliance2), The Wilderness Mission (Incubation), Tides of War (Warcraft2): these are expansions that have not only introduced many new elements to the original game, but have generally been able to improve the title making it almost perfect. The second category, which we could define as ~More of The Same~ (Trad .: I finished the expansion but I haven't found the news yet), is the middle one, which includes only discreet, pleasant but really not very innovative products. Any titles? All those of Westwood in general (Aftermath and the other titles in the Red Alert / Tiberian Sun series), the same Opposing Force (Half Life, funny but really too short), the new missions of Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear. Undoubtedly the most populated category, where programmers who have not been able to dare rest... The third category, the worst, we will call for convenience ~Whatttttttthe Hell????~ (Transl.: Are we kidding??), and it is the one where we find the expansions produced only to recover money from the gamers, who are dazzled by the promises and crushed by reality. In it we find some real goodies: Hellfire (Diablo), Subversion (Incoming), somehow House Party (The Sims), but above all those products that do not offer anything else that we could not find for free on the Net. to see where this Halls of Valhalla can be classified: will you follow me?", "date": "2001-06-22", "grade": null}
