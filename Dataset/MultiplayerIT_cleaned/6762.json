A rather original idea but only partially successful, mainly due to the far from obvious availability of gameplay designed for a completely different purpose to be repositioned in a context of this type. To this was added the evidently low budget nature of the project, extremely minimal and devoid of frills bordering on the meager, and a far from veiled basic feeling of the desire to use NES Remix as a trojan horse to sell the Virtual versions Console of the individual titles represented within it. Although Director Koichi Hayashida had stated in the past that NES Remix was in fact a project designed for Wii U and that a Nintendo 3DS version would have been very complicated to make, time (or marketing) has evidently suggested a different evolution for the things, in favor of the evergreen portable Nintendo. Ultimate NES Remix is a lazy and listless adaptation sold at a simply unfair price The charm of vintage? However, Ultimate NES Remix should not be understood as an all-inclusive package of everything that appeared in the two original episodes for Wii U: on the contrary, it is more of a selection, a sort of ~best of~ ideal on paper which, however, does not reveal itself exactly such to the proof of the facts. As for the game formula, we refer you to the in-depth description of our previous two reviews of the home console editions, since there have been no changes of any kind. In a synthetic way, it is enough to know that the idea behind NES Remix is precisely to create a series of challenges, generally lasting a few seconds each, by extrapolating sections from some titles originally published on the historic 8-bit Nintendo console . To be clear, you may have to eliminate a certain amount of enemies in Super Mario Bros., or keep the bike wheeling in Excitebike, or destroy a few barrels in Donkey Kong and so on. To these are added the Remix levels, which mix the cards on the table with results that often bring with them the best the product has to offer. In general, the challenge lies not only in completing these mini-missions, but rather in doing it in the shortest possible time: the performances are in fact evaluated with stars, thanks to which it is possible to actually unlock other games and consequently other contents. Compared to the Wii U version, in Ultimate NES Remix the time limits have actually been made less stringent, making it easier to obtain the maximum score. A choice which, if on the one hand it lowers the entry threshold allowing even less expert players to continue without excessive frustration, on the other it can annoy those who had found the challenge level of the originals an intriguing stimulus if not even a key element of the game. whole experience. It should also be noted the absence of what, on Wii U, was one of the most pleasant features, namely the integration with the Miiverse which allowed you to collect suggestions, indications or simple drawings in every single level left by other players through the bulletin board virtual game of the Nintendo home console and earn related stamps. On Nintendo 3DS this type of social interaction is not present, effectively making Ultimate NES Remix a much more ~solitary~ experience. As a partial refund in this sense, the unprecedented availability of online rankings has been introduced to compare one's records with those of other users on each individual stage: with a bizarre choice however, Nintendo has chosen to allow this comparison only with friends or players of the same territorial area, excluding instead the world ranking. Turning instead to the list of mini-games included in the package, as mentioned at the beginning, this portable version brings with it only some of the titles that have instead gone through the two chapters for Wii U: more specifically, of the thirty historical names previously exploited are 16 were chosen, which beyond personal tastes are in fact roughly the best. Finally, among the extras we should mention the Nintendo World Championship Remix, identical to the one present in NES Remix 2, and the bizarre Speed Mario Bros., which is a not very interesting version of the original masterpiece made to go at double speed. Certainly Ultimate NES Remix turns out to be more convincing than the original publication in the very philosophy of the product, which due to its hit and run nature is ideal forshort gaming sessions go much better with the characteristics of a portable console. In fact, on Nintendo 3DS it seems to be simply more at ease, and it is therefore a pity that some questionable choices in terms of content have reduced this indisputable advantage. But where Nintendo has undoubtedly made the most serious mistake is in fixing the price: if on Wii U both chapters were sold for 9.99, on Nintendo 3DS Ultimate NES Remix it is also offered for 39.99 in the edition digital on eShop. Whereas the costs of production and distribution of the retail version can put the amount requested in a more understandable perspective, on the eShop these are totally reduced, leaving laptop owners faced with the unpleasant situation of having to pay double to have half the contents and several neutered mode. Needless to say, there is also no incentive or discount for those who bought the previous releases on Wii U.
