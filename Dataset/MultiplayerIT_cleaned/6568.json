{"name": "Kick & Fennick", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/145079-kick-fennick-un-grande-salto.html", "text": "The young Kick awakens from his cryogenic sleep in the middle of a mysterious and hostile world, inhabited by metallic guardians who don't seem to know the concept of hospitality. When one of these androids is about to hit him, the boy is saved by Fennick, a small flying robot, who gives him a powerful rifle with which he can make great leaps to find a way out of this place. However, Fennick's battery was damaged during the rescue, and so the two decide to face the dangers of the planet together to find a new one. This is the incipit of Kick & Fennick, a mix of platformers and puzzles for PlayStation Vita that PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to download for free throughout the month of February. It is a rather original title in its own way, characterized by a control system that uses only the analog sticks in combination with any back button, or directly the touch screen, to operate the rifle we have just talked about, which may turn out to be useful both for hitting enemies and switches, and above all for making large jumps, essential for overcoming the many traps we will encounter, during a campaign consisting of forty-five levels and divided into five different chapters. Double jump Each Kick & Fennick stage presents a series of obstacles or traps to overcome, some hostile androids to shoot at, switches to turn on and any platforms, static or mobile, to reach. The interesting thing is that to get to the exit from time to time we will not have to make direct jumps, but ~indirect~ rebound jumps, using the rifle to gain momentum and reusing it in mid-air, in the middle of a useful as well as spectacular bullet time, to possibly correct the trajectory or add further thrust. A concept that proves to be solid right from the start, capable of proposing non-trivial puzzle solving, based on timing and precision, but which for this very reason clashes with the poor reliability of the small analog sticks of PlayStation Vita, which prevent more often than not to obtain clear and stable trajectories. This results in quite a few largely avoidable deaths, which fortunately doesn't produce that much frustration due to an ~energy bar~ that depletes a bit every time we make a mistake, ending up on for example a laser, and projecting us with each lethal contact to the spot where we were immediately before. In short, to get to having to start a level over again, we will have to make mistakes quite a few times and exhaust the indicator just mentioned. Fortunately, in the most complicated cases we will be able to use touch controls - less immediate but decidedly more precise and reliable - to complete the maneuver. Kick & Fennick offers different entertainment than usual and a good number of levels, but it doesn't take off PSVita trophies Unlocking the fifteen Trophies present in Kick & Fennick will not be a particularly difficult undertaking, given that most of them are obtained simply by progressing through the game and completing it, as well as by completing tasks that are closely related to the gameplay: being saved by Fennick fifty times, shoot two hundred different enemies, jump fifteen hundred times and so on. Little variety If the formula behind Kick & Fennick appears original and interesting, with bullet time making our maneuvers to overcome this or that obstacle even more spectacular, or eliminating a robotic guardian on the fly after a jump, at the same time the variety is lacking worryingly. The level design of the game is in fact rather repetitive, it seems to always be in the same area and the only substantial difference is precisely the environmental puzzles to be solved. Neither on the one hand do the opponents to face increase, nor does Kick come into possession of skills capable of refreshing the gameplay, given that the only upgrades make the rifle more or less powerful, consequently increasing the range of possible trajectories. Even the bosses tend to repeat themselves, always putting the same big quadrupedal android in front of us, even if the ways to defeat him and continue the adventure change. All this unfortunately produces a sense of flatness, the lack of involvement necessary to get to the end with pleasure. And it's a shame, because from a technical point of view the work done by the developers is not bad at all, even if the repetitiveness of the scenarios is evident here too. In the end, in short, Kick & Fennick undoubtedly stands as a different title from the usual thanks to the starting idea, but it is a pity that the authors have not been able to insert a greater experience into the experience.and variety.", "date": "2015-02-16", "grade": "6.8"}
