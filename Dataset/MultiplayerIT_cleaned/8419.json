The latest effort by Funcom and writer-slash-programmer Ragnar Trnquist (The Longest Journey, Dreamfall) is placed on the market without a fight, without super maintenance and cheeky servers, yet practically nobody cares; better gossip about the fate of Star Wars: The Old Republic or the next TERA vanarchs. On the one hand, it must also be understood: Funcom's previous MMO, Age of Conan, didn't exactly make a great impression and it took quite a bit of time and a healthy transition to the F2P model to get it back on track, by which time it was too late. The Secret World has built a niche of down-to-earth fans, fascinated perhaps more by the extravagant concept and Lovecraftian atmosphere than by the raw gameplay. The prerequisites for something completely new were all there and, surprise, in fact there is something new, but is it enough to justify a monthly fee in a market that is now so competitive? ... Voyagers! The forces of evil are tightening the snare, they communicate to us, and now our paranormal powers have attracted the attention of one of the three factions that you will be able to choose at the beginning of the game, creating your avatar with the little that the editor. Illuminati, Dragons and Templars, practically Dan Brown's erotic-videogame dream. In reality, there isn't much difference between the three factions, apart from a few cutscenes, a secret-but-not-too-secret base and a handful of story-driven missions, and this is in fact one of the reasons that makes the creation of superfluous one or more secondary characters. The approach chosen by Funcom, however, is decidedly unusual: the world of The Secret World is ours; the settings are inspired by real-life locations such as London or Egypt and the creatures we will face are not elves and goblins but beings drawn from the most remote folklore. In place of orcs and dragons there are the Babau and the secret sons of C'thulu, machine guns and pistols replace bows and crossbows, magic is voodoo... In short, esotericism and occultism in a realistic world, made so by an extraordinary cure for the detail not only narrative, but also graphic: in particular the very high quality of textures and shaders is striking, thanks also to the support of DirectX 11 and tessellation which make the settings of great impact. What steals the show, however, are the plays of light and sound effects, specially designed to create a truly extraordinary atmosphere. The price of so much splendor? A scalable but not very graceful client. It is therefore a shame that the polygonal models of the characters and common enemies look so crude, banal and woody, a real eyesore of this little graphic orgy. The missions are often preceded by (too) long fully dubbed cutscenes in which the eccentric characters on duty explain the situation to us and provide us with a brief background information with sharp jokes and pop culture. The impression is that of being in an episode of Supernatural with a drop of Hellblazer and a sprinkling of Fringe, shake well before serving. A bit TV-series and a bit Bonelli cartoon, The Secret World manages to involve right away thanks also and above all to the characterization of the NPCs. The references to everyday life sometimes appear a bit forced, written more for show than out of real necessity, but it is clear that the guys from Trnquist wanted to follow the path already traced by Star Wars: The Old Republic, giving the heart of the game , the missions we will undertake, a decidedly greater depth. My friend Google At first glance, The Secret World appears to be the usual theme-park MMORPG full of NPCs with the quest perched over their heads, even if the presence of these icons a bit everywhere and not in precise agglomerations, also called hubs for those who chew the jargon, already perplexing. Each map is chock full of missions to complete, which are themselves divided into multiple steps or, as the game calls them, tiers. Let's get the pebble off our shoe right away: yes, there are the infamous pure grinding ~kill x monsters~ quests and yes, there are also those of collection, even if in general you have to go to specific points to recover objects. Surprisingly, these are the rarest quests in the pack. Or rather, the ~fight & collect~ component is always integrated into each mission, but hidden among the multiple objectives that we will have to achieve, which follow one another organically following a precise narrative process. Funcom really wants the players to give a lot of importance to the mission they are carrying out, therefore it is notIt is possible to follow more than one at a time by type and in that case we will have to ~pause~ the previous one and return to activate it from the NPC at the right time. And it is always for an immersion factor that the objects with which we will have to interact or that we will have to collect are not in gaudy evidence thanks to sources of light or flashy textures, but blended perfectly with the scenery: if they ask you to retrieve a register in an office don't expect the highlighted bright profile, rather get ready to scour the room by moving the mouse cursor on the desk. These are the more traditional missions, then there are the investigation ones which are a whole different ballgame, complex and ingenious to the point of becoming frustrating more due to our ineptitude than to the masochism of the developers. The investigative missions do not offer crystal clear indications but vague clues that lead us to explore the map much more carefully in search of a particularly important detail or element. There is no shortage of puzzles and riddles designed to make us think or, perhaps, search on Google thanks also to the slightly buggy mini-browser integrated into the client. If you thought it impossible that one day you would go looking for a particular Bible verse for an MMORPG, The Secret World is ready to surprise you. Investigation missions are great but can get frustrating if you don't want to see the solution on YouTube. They still represent the highest peak ever in many years of theme-park MMORPGs, something we hope future titles will draw inspiration from. The reward for our efforts is the usual: money, items, emblems to spend on special equipment and experience points. I, jack of all trades Following the now obvious trend of abolishing the sacred trinity of MMORPGs, Funcom has invented a progression system as intricate as it is interesting, unfortunately not without its flaws. In practice, you don't really level up and the accumulated experience points unlock two types of points: Skill and Ability. With the former it is possible to unlock various bonuses for weapons and learn to wear increasingly high quality equipment, which in turn will influence our statistics and skills; with the latter instead you access a stratified wheel that includes all the skills of the game, divided by degree and type. Basically, every weapon has a certain style of play, so ~hammers~ are meant for defense and machine guns are better suited for ranged combat. However, there is no clear distinction between the various weapons and they can all do a little bit of everything, including healing, but there is the weapon that does it better and the one that does it worse. With Ability points we expand our arsenal, choosing the ones we like best and filling the seven slots for active skills and the same seven for passive skills. Outside of a fight it is possible to change the skills in the bar on the fly and our builds can be stored in a convenient menu. In case we lack the imagination, we could also rely on the builds specially suggested by Funcom. In short, there is a great freedom of choice but the amount of information that is offered to us in one go is mammoth, furthermore the game uses a very peculiar descriptive language: it is difficult to understand which skills to acquire to fill the role that interests us; the only way is to proceed by trial and error, reading each description in a pool of hundreds of skills. The best solution? Complete mission after mission, repeat them ad nauseam whenever possible, and learn it all. At that point you practically become a god on earth and you can play any role, today I woodpecker and tomorrow I cure. Does the system work? Yes and no. Repeating already completed missions to exhaustion is just another form of grinding and the limited amount of locations with which the game was launched, however vast, exacerbates this feeling. Furthermore, the setting almost seems to encourage the single-player experience by cutting out very little space for socialization: The Secret World players have practically no reason to join a group, except to face the canonical dungeons or the inevitable team missions. Templars & Dragons Even the dungeons offer some distinctive elements, for example the lack of inferior enemies (or ~trash~) between one boss and another. In some cases the bosses follow one after the other and the players, up to five, must simply follow a path to the next battlefield. In front of the boss on duty, one realizes that the trinity is needed and without a tank, a healer and a damage-per-second up to par, one has a short life. Nonetheless, Funcom has designed engaging, if excessive, encounterslong, which require both collaboration and autonomy from the beginning of the game. It's a pity that at the moment there is no real endgame complete with raids where you can test more than one party at the same time: in fact The Secret World is an endgame in itself from the beginning, as the PvP system also demonstrates. In theory, the three factions of the game should be engaged in a timeless war but, in practice, the conflict is limited to two team matches and an open guerrilla zone that favors bonuses to the faction that wins the most. The two battlegrounds are extremely banal and the queues to access them are particularly long, a probable symptom of the users' lack of interest. In these cases, moreover, we find ourselves having the features of a masked soldier equal to all the others, with only the color and the weapons to distinguish the players on the field. Fortunately, our statistics also temporarily become equal to those of the opponents, thus maintaining an apparent balance that is upset in a few seconds by the predictable super powerful builds of the moment. Fusang, on the other hand, is a much larger, permanent map characterized by various objectives to defend and conquer, but even in this case, the interest of the community seemed rather superficial. It is probably also the fault of the cumbersome combat system, degraded by woody animations and an almost total absence of impact between the bodies; reactivity is also another not insignificant problem, considering above all that the battle system is based entirely on the accumulation and consumption of special resources and on the possibility of dodging at the right time, the latter action being only relatively useful due to the long charging period and input response delay.", "date": "2012-07-19", "grade": "7.3"}
