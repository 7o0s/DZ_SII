After the horror saga, the team changed direction and dedicated themselves to a completely different project: an isometric action game inspired by a novel saga, composed of Batora The Awakening and Batora The Mark of the Earth. However, the title proposes an independent plot that does not require having read the books. Batora Lost Haven is available from October 20, 2022 on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. A Nintendo Switch version is also planned and will arrive later, at a date yet to be determined. Now that we've tried the full version, we're therefore ready to tell you what we think. All you have to do is continue reading the review of Batora Lost Haven. Sun and moon Avril, right, and her friend, left, in Batora Lost Haven Batora Lost Haven puts us in the role of Avril, a girl from Earth who has obtained the powers of Sun and Moon. These are almost supernatural entities that fill the role of guardians of our planet. It's just a pity that they failed miserably and that the Earth was mostly destroyed by an undefined cataclysm. Avril then becomes the Guardian of Balance and, with a friend in tow, travels from planet to planet with the aim of purifying its core and restoring order to the entire Universe, while also saving the Earth. Avril, protagonist of Batora Lost Haven On this journey we will have to move to four different worlds, where we will meet various alien races often fighting each other, making choices on how to continue the adventure and how to reach our goal. The plot isn't particularly original and the choices we'll make have minimal impact, but the real problem with Batora Lost Haven is the pace. Batora is a game that tries to do a lot in a very short time. We completed the adventure in less than five hours and the whole time the game had its foot on the gas and the further you progressed the faster everything became. Stormind Games has packed four worlds, various alien races, names, cultures and social structures into one very short game. We barely have time to understand what we are doing and who are the creatures in front of us that we are already ready to go to the next world. The end result is that nothing of what happens is absorbed and no character has room to be explored. The second world, a large desert, in Batora Lost Haven Avril and her friend also pass the time pecking each other with little jokes, perhaps not always appropriate for two girls who have just seen their world fall apart and lost many loved ones. As you progress, the game tries to make everything more dramatic, showing the suffering of the protagonist who is faced with increasingly difficult choices that define the life and death of aliens. Too bad that the latter were encountered literally twenty minutes earlier and within another half hour they will disappear from our sight. These leaps from comedy to drama are too sudden: the mix may or may not like it, but objectively the narrative deserved to handle everything more calmly. There are many small ideas in Batora Lost Haven and we felt the ambition of the team to make a deep and interesting storyline, but it is clear that the possibility of creating a more massive work has been missing. We're also sorry because the various worlds, even if technically very simple, are all visually pleasing and offer various types of environments: nothing too original, but if we had the time or even just the reason to spend a few extra minutes in each area, we wouldn't we would have been sorry. Sword and magic Avril attacks with the greatsword in Batora Lost Haven The truth is that Batora Lost Haven wouldn't have been particularly more interesting if it had been more fleshed out and had slowed down the narrative. The speed of the story means that you don't get bored from a playful point of view. Batora is a mix of battles and puzzle game stages. The entire game is a collection of small dungeons - all the same in structure, no matter which planet you are on - always very linear and poor in variation. You move from point A to point B by defeating all the enemies that pop up and when the time comes you complete some puzzles in an alternate dimension. The latter go from being sometimes a little interesting and sometimes a little boring: these are small labyrinths in which we have to perform actions such as moving a sphere on a percourse to activate push buttons, or press timed switches, or switch between moving platforms. They are on average very easy. Avril attacks with the mental form in Batora Lost Haven Both the puzzles and the battles are based on the use of Avril's two natures, namely the physical and the mental, which correspond to the Sun and the Moon. The physical form fights with a greatsword while the mental form uses magical projectiles. Enemies also have one of two forms and take more damage when using the same form. Each form, in addition to a basic combo, has four skills that are automatically unlocked as you progress. You can dodge, activate shields and use two types of special attacks: all moves have a cooldown after use. Furthermore, using a form charges a gauge of the opposite one which can be consumed to heal and empower the character for a few moments. An example of a puzzle in Batora Lost Haven Batora's idea is therefore to switch between physical and mental to keep charging the gauge and using the power-up, taking turns facing enemies of the right type. Even the life bars are separated between physical and mental, so it is always advisable to alternate one and the other to heal. The combat works, especially in the second half when you have access to all the moves, and can be entertaining as it is fast and dynamic with the constant shape-shifting, but the battles quickly become repetitive. If the game had lasted longer, that would have been a problem. The bosses improve the situation as they have a dual nature and the two health bars must be shortened in a balanced way, otherwise the enemy can heal himself. A boss in Batora Lost Haven Avril can also be enhanced with runes, which fall into three categories: Neutral, Defender, and Conqueror. Each rune has a cost and the maximum points to equip them depend on our narrative choices: some decisions are for a Defender while others are for a Conqueror. The truth is, though, it doesn't make too much difference which way we go and what we equip, especially since the Neutrals make sure to boost us just enough. The fights are never particularly difficult. In the safe areas of each world we will find merchants who sell some runes and the game offers various types of materials to be used as bargaining chips. In reality, however, all these systems are superfluous and there are no real builds to create for Avril, one statistic is simply given priority over another (between life, damage and the power of crits and cures) without however really can have a big impact on these. Again, the game is too small and too fast and doesn't allow room for the RPG side to evolve and become relevant. A first world area in Batora Lost Haven Finally, we point out that the game is not dubbed in Italian, but there are subtitles and menus in our language. The dubbing is discreet but in general the sound did not impress us, neither for effects nor for the soundtrack. For trophy hunters or more generally completionists, we point out that it is possible to take advantage of the automatic save system to return to the various points in which Avril is asked for a choice. You can do it immediately, from world to world, or even immediately after the end of the game, getting all the trophies without having to play a second game: in about 7 hours we got Platinum.", "date": "2022-10-23", "grade": "7.0"}
