This is the great value of Star Wars: The Old Republic, which basically offers eight great BioWare RPGs for the price of a single game and a monthly subscription. Some might argue that, barring each class' unique histories, the game is basically the same and the settings don't change and in fact you pay to replay it, which is true, but wasn't it fun to replay Mass Effect 2 as well making choices different races or start over Dragon Age: Origins with another race to discover the differences in the prologue and change the evolution of the story? BioWare's MMORPG does just that, it guarantees at least eighty hours of extra gameplay for the price of a pizza. An encouraging thought in those months when there is nothing new or inviting to play. With such a point of view in mind, the rest of this atypical review will be much clearer to you. That galaxy far, far away... We've been quite busy in the last thirty days. In between we traveled the length and breadth of space hunting down Sith lords and traitors to the Republic, destroying potentially devastating interplanetary weapons, stopping plots, recruiting new allies, and uncovering millennia-old secrets of the history of races. that we didn't even know existed. At the moment we are working to save the galaxy and it is not certain that we will succeed, even if the Force flows powerfully in us and the second rank of the driving license prevents us from being thrown off continuously as happened before, even if those two hundred thousand credits they cost us sweat, effort and a daily visit to the intergalactic auction networks. As we said, we have been busy. And probably our adventure in the virtual universe of The Old Republic would have been decidedly less exciting if it hadn't been for BioWare's extraordinary talent in telling our space odyssey. The beautiful Belsavis is actually a huge prison This is undoubtedly the great, fundamental feature that differentiates the new Star Wars MMORPG from the competition: the awareness that, for once, the entire leveling phase is not just an end in itself or aimed solely at acquiring objects or power-ups: there is a story, a beautiful story, which immediately makes clear a truly crucial detail and that is the importance of the player, who ceases to be ~one among many~ as in many other games of the same genre . Our influence is constantly reaffirmed, making us an active part in every type of mission both during dialogues and on the battlefield when even the simplest of quests is fully motivated, without sending us to slay imperial ~just because~. The story of each class, divided into a prologue and three chapters to which are added countless secondary quests that tell us in more detail the story of each single planet, is the main reason that makes The Old Republic an atypical MMORPG, playable even alone , without feeling a sense of unfinished business because you haven't faced a raid-boss or obtained a particular piece of equipment. Republic and Empire face off on the plains of Balmorra Two are in company The key to this peculiar use of the game lies without a shadow of a doubt in the Companions, a feature of radical importance that changes the cards on the table right away, making up for some questionable decisions by the developer. In fact, the Companions make the choice of a less suitable specialization for the solitaire game much more bearable, becoming a real complement to our skills that improves with us as we take care of their equipment and expand the support cast, allowing us to choose the most suitable Companion for the needs of the case and to vary our strategies and our approach towards the various situations in which we will come across. At the same time the Companions give new life to a deep and non-invasive crafting system, in which the player does not have to do anything but give an order and spend some credits to obtain materials and produce new objects to be used or resold at auction. perhaps taking advantage of the discovery of some rara recipe for establishing itself on the intergalactic market. In three thousand years this Sarlacc will try to eat Han Solo If you add to all this the fact that the Companions intervene in the dialogues and that each of them has a story to tell, as long as you are fond of them enough, it is easy to realize how this feature is probably the main workhorse of an MMORPG that , all in all, from the point of view of the gameplay it does not present anything particularly innovative. The Companions also make Star Wars: The Old Republic a perfect game for those who rarely play in company: they certainly do not reach the performance of a human player but they satisfactorily fill gaps of this type and offer a tasty strategic approach towards seemingly out-of-this-world challenges. reach. A few lines above we have mentioned the crafting that can be carried out through the Companions and it is worth spending a few words on the subject. The game offers a good variety of useful professions in various situations, from Synthweaving which allows you to manufacture clothing for ~force users~, to Biochem which allows you to produce regenerative and enhancing consumables. As often happens in these cases, some professions turn out to be more useful than others in different moments of the game: those that allow you to create your own equipment offer a clear advantage in the leveling phase but become rather useless once you reach the endgame and the in which it is necessary to recover the definitive equipment in the various Flashpoints, while other professions based on consumables guarantee secure income thanks to the constant demand of users. On balance we are satisfied with the result obtained with the crafting which, in addition to being satisfying, offers something different for each type of player. On the other hand, we are less satisfied with the Galactic Trade Network, substantially the auction house of The Old Republic, marred by an awkward and limited interface: basically the GTN works and allows you to sell and buy without problems, more than anything else it is very difficult to consult and the impossibility of filtering the sub-categories of the objects is certainly a thorn in the side for the entire economy. We had some difficulties... We have already mentioned several times in our previous articles, the superlative soundtrack and the always excellent quality of the voice acting and there really isn't much more to add, except facing the final boss of a Flashpoint to the tune of an orchestral remix of Duel of the Fates is an experience that any fan of Star Wars and RPGs should try sooner or later. So let's come to the painful notes, because they exist and are also quite showy. To start with, it's impossible not to criticize such a poorly optimized client: The Old Republic is really heavy software, capable of tiring systems that run Skyrim without too much paranoia. Yet the game, which uses the modest HeroEngine, certainly does not shine for aesthetics: beyond the character design which, as already mentioned above, can be appreciated or not based on tastes, the graphics in general are very pleasant but not free from defects. The various planets and the areas that characterize them offer an excellent variety and attention to detail, even the planet-metropolises such as Coruscant and Nar Shaddaa, conceptually very similar, present substantial differences that make each new location a small design jewel only mined by frequent too large and empty spaces. The final boss of Flashpoint ~The Red Reaper~ Other planets, such as the evergreen (so to speak!) Tatooine or the icy Hoth strike the Star Wars fan directly to the heart with care and fidelity to cinematic sources while ~unpublished~ settings such as Alderaan or Belsavis remind us how the George Lucas universe is a perfect blend of fantasy and sci-fi themes. If anything, the problem lies in the naked and raw bugs of the code, in the discreet polygon count, in the often chilling low resolution textures that we will have to keep at least until the 1.2 update scheduled for March and in the animations, spectacular and very fluid in combat and during the dialogues , but wooden and imperfect in any other situation. And the infamous anti-aliasing? A measly 2x at maximum setting after a month of waiting, and then we're back to forcing it by modifying .ini files to acquire a definition that doesn't recall a PlayStation 2 game. In light of all this, the heaviness of the client and the slowness of the frequent uploads seem unjustified in a 2012 product where it is also impossible to change the interface in any way. The issue of textures is also rather ambiguous: according to BioWare, the developers have accomplished thischosen to not stress the systems in the presence of numerous players. However, this truth clashes with the existence of a questionable and antiquated mechanic that generates multiple instances of the same planet to scatter the players and minimize lag and conflicts of interest, with the result that we often find ourselves traveling for a long time without meeting a living soul. sharpening the feeling of playing an offline RPG rather than an MMORPG. ...but the Force was with us It seems to us perfectly useless to quibble about the balance between classes and their abilities, given that an MMORPG is an ever-changing matter in which the cards are easily reversed from month to month and in this sense BioWare has already taken some steps forward, announcing or making changes on the performance of more or less unfortunate classes. There remains some perplexity regarding PvP in which some classes certainly appear more advantageous thanks to deadly forms of crowd-control that should certainly be reviewed. In any case, the clash with the other players is quite fun and satisfying both visually and conceptually and allows you to overlook these drawbacks. Warzones offer a good variety of situations and Huttball is confirmed as the funniest and most original of the three. On the other hand, the system of instances of the planets also makes the opportunities for random PvP much more rarefied during the exploration of the areas prior to the third chapter of the story even on dedicated servers and the only opportunity to give them a good fight in freedom is represented from Ilum, a planet specially designed for the battles between the two factions which, however, has never been tested in Beta and was released in an almost primordial form undermined above all by programming naivety and a lot of structural superficiality. A flamethrower-wielding Wookiee in the ~Cademimu~ Flashpoint Between one bug and another, BioWare is working to change not only the game system of Ilum but also the way players can obtain the ultimate equipment for their characters, be it PvE or PvP. This is the real dilemma of an endgame that is perhaps too premature and limited, which at the moment seems to revolve around improving the players' equipment, obtainable through the constant repetition of daily quests, Flashpoints and Operations in normal and difficult modes. On this front, The Old Republic certainly does not disappoint and immediately offers a dozen Flashpoints which include in different doses the characteristic of dialogues and moral choices that can change the outcome of a situation; unfortunately, however, there is a lack of a tool to quickly create a group or the possibility of changing specialization at will, absences that will probably be reviewed in the coming months but which at the moment make the search for players rather difficult, while improving community interaction and reviving chat channels. An element as curious as it is pleasant consists in the numerous secret paths that it is possible to discover by exploiting the professions of the players, for example by activating elevators or devices that lead to shortcuts or even optional bosses. In general, the Flashpoints satisfied us thanks to the good variety of settings and mechanics devised by the BioWare developers but also for the way they are introduced and developed from a narrative point of view, with some excellent references to the Knights of the Old Republic bilogy which convince us, once again, that we are playing a third chapter magically transformed into an MMORPG due to the ruthless laws of business.", "date": "2012-01-20", "grade": "8.0"}
