In reality, however, it is no coincidence that, as we have already said, a phrase attributed to Galileo Galilei was chosen for the title of this product, given that physics certainly plays a decisive role within the game mechanics of AYIM: in a world made of cut paper it is in fact possible to completely rotate the screen by 90 or even 180, adding to the classic 2D something certainly original and never seen before which takes us more towards what we could define a ~2D and a half~. Turn here, turn there The minimal interface that can be accessed after completing the installation of the game immediately makes us understand that this is a no-frills production, which immediately catapults the player into the heart of the action, be it a relaxed game in single mode or a race against the time to compete against other people scattered around the globe via the Internet, with the possibility of being able to improve their times thanks to the classic ~ghost~ that we often see in driving simulations. Once you enter the actual game, you find yourself in the presence of a classic two-dimensional platform where you can go forward or backward, jump or rotate the view, thus completely changing the composition of the land on which you stand: immediately you realizes that this part of the game mechanics is the one that should be most exploited to access otherwise unthinkable places and thus overcome all the major obstacles we encounter, in a continuous trial and error on which the whole essence of AYIM is based , given that the ultimate goal of the game is to complete the various levels in the shortest possible time. A missing element that would certainly have added value at least to the single mode is any narrative part attributable to a minimum of history, completely absent. A paper world From a visual point of view, AYIM obviously does not aim to challenge the best-sellers of the video game: the setting studied by the developers is that of a world completely made of paper, where precisely even our character is nothing more than a piece of clipping it moves here and there trying to get to its own ~container~. Given the main feature of the game mechanics of this title, it is inevitable to dwell on the physics engine implemented by Broken Rules, which, although not free from some bugs, manages to do its duty especially in the management phases of the rotations of the scenario, sometimes even sudden among them, while the management of gravity in free falls seems a little less convincing. The latter are actually one of the main dangers of the game together with black holes (they are also cut out), since despite being made of paper our virtual alter-ego still suffers from a certain intolerance for spetasciamento on the ground.", "date": "2009-08-27", "grade": "8.5"}
