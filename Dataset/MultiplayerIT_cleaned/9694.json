However, coming to think of a ninja named Join Francois who speaks with a French accent while suspiciously climbing between the buildings appears, rather than the work of a talented group of programmers, the fruit of a mind with dubious intellectual abilities . And yet, in Urban Ninja it is precisely the aforementioned Join Francois who is the undisputed protagonist, who in spite of the rather worrying premises will not fail to surprise the many fans of Apple travel entertainment. Libert, galit, helicopter The narrative background behind the adventures of the young ninja from beyond the Alps is rather obscure: engaged as a secret agent, the only certainty in the player's possession concerns the need for recovery at the end of each mission by a helicopter, stationary in patient waiting in increasingly inaccessible places to reach. Thus deprived of justifications relating to places and times anchored to a plot, the game can completely indulge itself, reconstructing increasingly vast and far-fetched rescue scenarios. In fact, we must immediately make it clear that Join Francois' escapes towards safety will almost never have anything to do with the laws of traditional physics, apart perhaps from the inevitable force of gravity (very limited in any case, given the magnitude of jumps and falls and the Spiderman-style ability to cling to walls). The lack of any element of realism was on the other hand predictable already looking at the context of Urban Ninja but, in the end, it is precisely the absurd situations to be faced that represent the main source of fun across all game scenarios. In the 40 missions available, which will be progressively unlocked upon reaching a minimum score, the final objective will be to cling to the lowest possible point of the rope thrown from the recovery helicopter, which can only be reached after a certain number of leaps between the roofs of the buildings. The need to attach to the lower part of the rope is dictated by the scoring system, which will reward more depending on the distance from the rescue aircraft. Along the way there are golden stars, traditionally used to accumulate points but, on this occasion, also used to recharge the energy from the jumps. In fact, the purple ninja cannot do too many consecutive stunts and, to avoid falling miserably, he will have to look after the energy indicator in the upper left corner. As the levels progress, inevitably, increasing difficulties will appear to get to the helicopter: the parameters for calibrating the jump, which is carried out by swiping your finger towards the desired direction, will vary due to the presence of unexpected enemies, usually covered with spines, or annoying obstacles, such as cannons and hooked platforms. Setting up the jump and avoiding all the unknowns present will therefore not be, at least initially, an easy undertaking. Particularly amusing is the interaction of the little protagonist with the soap bubbles, which can be used as elevators (in the same way as in Cut the Rope) and then plunge headlong into the midst of large groups of stars; moreover, it is not infrequently possible to use the ropes stretched between the buildings present in some stages to carry out a sort of Infamous ~grinding~, without electricity and with the hands, but still with a sure effect, while in other levels it will be necessary to activate the levers to be able to move forward (in any case always within easy reach). In addition to the main mode, in which the missions, as mentioned, will have to be gradually unlocked, there is the possibility of tackling all the stages right away thanks to training, also activating aids and upgrades; at the end of the training, the performance report and the number of handicaps used will be shown. Technically, Urban Ninja performs its duty in an orderly manner: the settings do not stand out for the detail or quality of the textures, but they are very colorful and convey a sense of joy that is well suited to the general context; moreover, the animations of the protagonist and of the monsters are in some cases really hilarious. Even the sound effects, while not standing out in general, follow the line of cheerfulness successfully traced up to here. Finally, the presence of a world ranking should be noted which, the only social element, in the absence of Game Center support, will allow you to compete with the strongest players.
