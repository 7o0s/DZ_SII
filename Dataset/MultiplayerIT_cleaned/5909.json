Yes, because it's been seven years since that Fallout 3 that managed to amaze longtime fans of the series and newcomers to role-playing games who approached the genre for the first time with that title. An action RPG with an extraordinarily detailed setting capable of combining the elements that made the saga famous with gameplay with a strong action flavour. Fallout 3 was an absolute masterpiece and it is with this enormous burden on the shoulders that the fourth chapter enters the market. Now is the time to sum up to understand if we are really faced not only with the probable Game of the Year 2015, but also with a new masterpiece that can equal or even surpass its predecessor. Here is finally the review of Fallout 4, the most anticipated RPG of the year! Different geography, same fate Outside of a short prologue that also works as a tutorial and allows us to better define our protagonist's statistics, the story of Fallout 4 takes place around 2280, practically in parallel with the events narrated in the previous title and a few hundred miles away from the Washington crossed in the third chapter. This time we will in fact find ourselves in Massachusetts, now called the Commonwealth, more precisely in Boston and in the neighboring suburbs complete with locations and monuments representative of the area. The narrative premise is always the same as in the series: man has not discovered transistors but has been able to harness the force of the atom, giving life to an incredible technological progress that combines the aesthetic and artistic style of the 50s with a whole series of rather imaginative technological inventions halfway between cyberpunk and the dirtiest science fiction to which cinema has accustomed us. However, the scarcity of resources, the increase in population and the continuous race for arms has brought civilization to the brink of nuclear catastrophe time and time again, mainly due to the friction between the United States and China. Finally, in October 2077, the atomic bombs begin to fall and only a few humans manage to take refuge in the Vaults, special fallout shelters built on American soil to survive the nuclear holocaust. Our protagonist manages to enter Vault 111 just a few minutes after the start of the bombardment and then ends up in hibernation for two hundred long years. When he wakes up, a dramatic event will happen that will force him to cross the wastelands of Boston desolate from atomic fallout to meet other more or less hostile humans, a flora and fauna modified by radiation and a long series of camps and buildings that clearly highlight the survival instinct of humanity and its will to find something good and habitable even in the worst existential conditions. The main story, despite having a rather interesting incipit, is perfectly in line with what Bethesda has accustomed us to for some time: moderately anonymous, without large peaks, perhaps too linear, it is a mere pretext to force us to wander around the area devastated by the atomic bombing. It presents all the clichs of the genre and is full of alternative endings, but it is far from what much more refined role-playing games in this sense have accustomed us to, on all fantasy titles that seem to be able to exploit a more multifaceted and in-depth imaginary and stories . Sure, Fallout 4 has on its side, as was the case with the third chapter, an extremely little-used setting in the gaming market and with incredible charm, but the narrative component is certainly not the strong point of the product. But be careful because this does not mean that the quests are few or boring. Indeed, as happened for many with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, in Fallout 4 it is the countless side missions that really shine and entertain the player. We will face dozens of them: some related to random encounters, others related to companions that we will be able to pick up on the street, others still particularly long or, on the contrary, solvable in a few minutes, not counting all those relating to the four factions with which we will cross our steps. From the Brotherhood of Steel to the Minutemen, passing through two other groups that we will not reveal to you to avoid any spoilers, the player will have to engage in long chains of quests that will lead him to bind more and more to the various groups until, near the epilogue of history, will necessarily have to make choiceswhich will lead him to antagonize other organizations in a particularly credible and satisfying Chinese pen-style system. Let's say then that even if you want to run like desperate people, you will struggle very much to see the end of the game before fifty hours but, most likely, it will take you at least twice as long if you want to find out more in detail what Fallout 4 can offer. Outside of Dogmeat, the protagonist dog of the game's announcement trailer, we will meet about a dozen potential companions as we carry out the various quests and face the dangers of Boston. We will be able to be accompanied only by one at a time and we will be able to exploit them as well as to attack the enemy, maintain a certain position or collect certain objects through a very rudimentary command system, also to build the inevitable romance as we improve our affinity with them by bringing them to us behind and respecting their preferences. There will be comrades who will love to see us break into locks and safes, others who will want us to be compassionate or, conversely, ruthless. The result, in the long run, will be specific bonuses and perks that we can only unlock once we have reached maximum mental affinity. And we will also be able to think about their equipment. It's just a pity that the system, however varied and pleasant thanks to the numerous characters, is too sketchy and superficial and it will be really difficult to become attached to one character rather than another: we will be more inclined to consider them pack mules to deposit the loot with in plus the ability to shoot and fight during engagements. And in this regard, the renewed management of the dialogues does not help either which, while offering a sort of multiple answer, prevents you from adequately deepening the conversations with the characters you meet. Playstation 4 trophies There are 51 Fallout 4 trophies, including the inevitable Platinum. There is only one gold one, related to the conclusion of the game at any level of difficulty while the 15 silver ones present are related to completing specific quests, crafting, reaching the 25th or 50th level of experience ( essential for unlocking all perks) as well as collecting all Bobbleheads. The 34 bronze trophies, however long and tiring to unlock, are still related to other quests and various collectibles that you will be able to collect with a little effort. In our hasty game we stopped at just under 20% of these trophies. Action! For all Fallout 3 veterans, this fourth chapter will feel immediately familiar by sharing much of the role-playing and combat system of its prequel. For those approaching the series for the first time, it must immediately be emphasized that Fallout 4 is a highly action-oriented RPG with a first-person view, as if it were a classic shooter. In reality it can also be played with the ~external~ camera, in the third person but, thanks to Bethesda's technical solutions, it is not the recommended view to face the title in the best way. With the precise aim of maximizing the tactical component and making fights less random, using the left backbone when you have an enemy in your line of sight activates the VATS, a sort of zoom on the opponent which, slowing down enormously the game action, allows you to target specific parts of the body in an attempt to disable the enemy on duty or to bring his health points to zero as quickly as possible. While using this view it is possible to have an idea of the chance of hitting the opponent and possibly know his resistances, while the fire of the weapon will consume the action points of your character which depend on the statistics and skills possessed. The peculiar combat system that made Fallout 3 famous returns in this sequel in all its glory, perfectly mitigating a certain propensity for action that seemed further increased in this fourth chapter. For all the other elements of the gameplay, the game perfectly respects what is expected of the genre: a rather in-depth inventory and divided between various screens to better manage the loot, even if more could have been done in terms of filters, a classic quest diary that allows you to see the status of each one at a glance and show it on the game map, the inevitable section dedicated to statistics and acquired skills. All available through the infamous Pip-Boy which can be accessed by pressing a button by pausing the game. Fallout 4 allows quick navigation between the various discovered locations that will be enriched over timere the map of the playing area with dozens of symbols. In terms of extension, it is difficult to make comparisons: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is likely to offer something more in this sense, especially if we take into account both areas of CDProjekt's masterpiece, but with Bethesda's work they are achieved new boundaries as regards the density of the scenario and above all the extreme care taken in offering a very detailed and credible geography, although not so varied. The points of interest are really many, often linked to special missions or activities and all extremely detailed especially when you approach the central area of Boston. However, we feel like making a criticism relating to the management of the difficulty of the various areas. The game offers the same zone system also seen in the previous title: there are points where the enemies are more powerful and others where they are more affordable. The player is left with all the pleasure of discovery since nowhere is this value indicated and even when you are in the presence of an opponent, his level or how much he is actually more powerful than us is never indicated (outside of a small skull that appears next to his name when he is extremely difficult to fight). We will therefore have to wait to hit or be hit to understand if the fight is actually within our reach or if it is better to run away. While on the one hand this system is very realistic and satisfying, we cannot hide how on many occasions we have faced a quest in complete tranquility only to then discover, once we reach the area after a very long walk, that there are only super mutants there enormously more powerful than us or a group of deathclaws ready to wait for us around the corner. And maybe we are still with the laser musket offered as a gift by the Minutemen. Here, in short, get ready for a healthy dose of frustration that will often come suddenly, especially at the maximum of the three difficulty levels. Also in Fallout 4 we find the SPECIAL system: seven statistics that determine the qualities of the protagonist and consequently our style of play. The novelty is all inherent in the evolution of these and the skills connected to them: each statistic can reach ten levels and each corresponds to a different purchasable perk. The further element of configurability is represented by the fact that most of these skills are divided into several degrees (usually from three to five) further increasing the customization of the system. At each level-up we will have a point that we can spend to buy or upgrade any of the accessible perks or to increase the basic statistics of the SPECIAL system, so as to unlock even higher level skills. In total there are more than two hundred and fifty combinations and this easily lets you imagine how the evolution of your character is virtually infinite and truly able to be tailored to everyone's way of playing. Minecrafting We can't help but dedicate an entire paragraph to the crafting system and camp management, probably the two most evident and structured innovations of this sequel, almost a sort of game within the game. Boston is literally overflowing with loot: there are hundreds of items that can be collected during our wanderings. Everything we collect can be broken down into building material which will be used to manage your camps and to craft weapon and armor upgrades. In fact, from the first hours of the game we will take possession of a village, and subsequently we will be able to free many others, where it will be possible to build an endless number of buildings to create your favorite towns. We will have to offer shelter to the inhabitants who will arrive from all corners of Massachusetts, plant crops and think about water resources, manage defenses, up to the building of clinics and shops of various types. This rudimentary city management, however cumbersome and perhaps a little too dispersive, has an incredible depth and we are convinced that it will be able to entertain Minecraft fans for tens, if not hundreds of hours, in an attempt to set up their own ideal network of villages. Once a certain size is reached, even managing the population becomes crucial to ensure that an adequate number of people keep the fields fertile while others worry about keeping the defenses active at all times. By investing a good number of points in the appropriate perks, we will also be able to indulge ourselves in high-level crafting through a whole series of workbenches that we will also be able to build in our", "date": "2015-11-09", "grade": "9.2"}
