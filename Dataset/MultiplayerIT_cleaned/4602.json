On the other hand, the Warner Bros title would have had what it takes to receive infinite expansions, with unlimited game worlds and enormous possibilities given all the combinations of existing characters. We were obviously very wrong. Alongside LEGO Dimensions, which in the meantime seems to be in dire straits, all those titles that made the saga famous continue to come out undeterred, however coming to saturate a market that now has dozens and dozens of iterations. We have reached the point that LEGO video games no longer even have to draw inspiration from famous films, as was the case for Star Wars, Indiana Jones or the Marvel films, but that they reach our consoles offering experiences borrowed directly from the big screen LEGO films. After LEGO the Movie, therefore, LEGO Ninjago the Movie: Video Game also arrives on the major platforms, a title ready to exploit the marketing of the film and re-proposing the adventures seen in the cinema in an interactive way on the living room screen. Will anything have changed? I used to play with LEGOs that's why I don't tie myself Of all the LEGO brands, Ninjago is probably, together with Nexo Knights, the one that has the least appeal to overgrown children traveling in their thirties, instead enjoying great success with the very young audience. In this case, the story wants six Ninja boys to be called to defend the city of Ninjago from the terrible Lord Garmadon, the usual ruthless bad guy eager to raze anything in front of him. The plot of LEGO Ninjago the Movie: Video Game is rather trivial as you may well understand and distances itself from the one seen in the cinema in several respects, making it even lighter and more light-hearted. If in fact on the film, as it was for LEGO the Movie, there are several interesting readings to do on several levels, arriving in the digital version all the more serious and profound nuances are lost, leaving them to be only the most frenetic and the most obvious jokes to find fertile ground to grow. Not that a new The Last of Us was expected, mind you, but we have seen how LEGO productions can give much more in this area and we are sorry to see a job that deserves a different fate diminished. In 2017, after we don't even know how many LEGO titles have been reviewed, still finding the usual gags based on hidden pigs, fish in the face and flying bananas is not exactly the best of fun and we feel the need for an evolution for this type of humor who really doesn't want to know about arriving. The story isn't even very well told by taking the film's key scenes and placing them between levels without bothering to connect them in a meaningful way. In short, we find ourselves in the hands of a mega bigino of the film, the vision of which is absolutely recommended before embarking on the adventures of the game, in order to be able to find each other during the narration. Perhaps we are asking too much for a title designed for a very young audience or for families who want to spend a few afternoons together but we like to underline how, even at this juncture, much more could be had with very little extra effort. LEGO Ninjago: The Movie Video Game is probably the most beautiful LEGO title to see and we have rarely seen cities so full of bricks and small buttons to collect even if the optimization is unfortunately not the best, causing the framerate to collapse during the most excited moments of the battles. Playstation 4 trophies In addition to the classic ten trophies inextricably linked to the progress in history, LEGO Ninjago the Movie: Video Game offers another forty linked to the various collectibles and secondary activities. To get platinum you will have to spend at least twelve hours of your free time, without going too crazy though. Among the various chapters of the series this is probably the easiest to complete 100%. If the frame collapses, rebuild it! However, when you least expect it, LEGO Ninjago the Movie: Video Game also gives you something positive. The structure of the gameplay is the classic one of all LEGO games, with the various levels to be overcome in the story mode and then faced again in free play by changing characters and thus unlocking all the various secondary activities, but the brick system for buying heroes and Extra costumes that must now be found in stages or unlocked by getting gold medals in dojo challenges. The structure and construction of the various levels remains more or less the same as always, with the need to slash to killere the bad guys on duty, break all the breakables and automatically reassemble the structures to advance: nothing could be more classic. Instead of the super powers seen with Marvel licensed games this time we have the various white weapons and ninja arts but the concept remains the same. To bring a little variety in the progression, therefore, we think about some shooter phases aboard the ninjago mechs but above all a slightly more sophisticated combat and growth system than usual. The red bricks disappear, replaced by six branches of talents, with boosts for damage or combos for example, a pleasant although not particularly revolutionary variation. On the other hand, we very much appreciated the removal of the level stud collection bar, now replaced by a much more sensible general bar. Basically, each button collected will now go into a common container that defines your general level and which will unlock various collectibles and bonuses with each completion, thus allowing you to replay only the missions you enjoyed most while still earning points. As for the combat system instead, fiddling on the pad by hitting the same key remains effective but several special moves arrive to bring greater depth to the game system. Double jumps, flying strikes and special moves are just the tip of the iceberg, to be chained together with the simplest strikes for ever more dynamic combat. It really is the only significant step forward in the title, leaving everything else on the classic canons we are now used to. To make the experience frustrating, unfortunately, there are also very long loadings, which break and break a game rhythm that should be as light as possible. Lastly, longevity is also below the average of LEGO titles: the campaign divided into about ten levels, can be completed in six/seven hours and if you dedicate yourself to looking for all the collectibles you can reach a maximum of about twelve hours . The split-screen mode and multiplayer arenas inherited from LEGO Dimension try to mitigate the problem, but remain a palliative for a title below the standards seen in other LEGO chapters.", "date": "2017-10-19", "grade": "6.5"}
