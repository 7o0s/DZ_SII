In fact, he used original ~mechanical~ metaphors to illustrate the functioning of complex scientific principles, above all the parallel between the human body and a factory from the 1920s. It is precisely on this specific concept that the experience of Homo Machina is based, the new puzzle game developed by Darjeeling Production in collaboration with ARTE Experience. In the game, available in premium format on iOS and Android at a price of 3.49 euros, our goal is to operate the complicated and multifaceted ~factory~ represented by the body of a man, starting from awakening and going through all the stages of day until it culminates with a gallant appointment, the latter event failing to agitate the ~director~ of the structure and his most trusted collaborators. The first impact with this peculiar mobile game is naturally based on the glance, on the delicious mix of animations, design and music put together by the development team, to compose a delicate and very pleasant work starting, precisely, from the studies of Kahn and his precise schematism. This is how the scent of coffee awakens the protagonist of the story: the particles are filtered by the nose and reach the olfactory receptors, which analyze them determining their nature, and then activate the mechanisms that regulate appetite. At that point it becomes imperative to open your eyes, remembering to connect the ~film~ that represents the subject's visual memory, and activate the various parts of the muscles one by one so that you can finally get out of bed. That's how we are done Homo Machina's puzzle mechanics are generally simple and immediate, devoid of any tutorial but capable of engaging when it comes to quickly connecting circuits or activating switches within a time limit, testing reflexes, alertness and precision. Everything is entrusted to the touch screen and to our ability to understand what to do in a few seconds, following the ~suggestions~ that are provided to us by the graphics and the excellent sound sector, made up of delicious music and simple but captivating effects. While the aforementioned ~director~, up in the brain, is on the phone with the various departments that control the functions of the body, here we are called to take care of the first chores: resolving the urge to empty the bladder, sitting down at the table to having breakfast and therefore cutting, mincing and mincing the food, to extract the macronutrients and capture them using the right enzyme, in this case in the form of a different colored suction pump. Then what? There is good music in the house, and the whole apparatus rejoices, but it is time to tell the eardrums to receive it correctly. And so on there too, regulating complex machinery by touching the screen so that everything works properly and every signal is translated correctly. The particular journey into the human body set up by Darjeeling Production is completed within an hour, and this undoubtedly represents the only limit of a production which, however, does not spare itself in any way, staging not only an extremely fascinating, but also a set of beautiful two-dimensional animations, with a cartoonish style, to represent the tiny characters who take care of administering the ~machine~, leading it through a thousand vicissitudes towards a happy epilogue.", "date": "2018-06-04", "grade": "8.0"}
