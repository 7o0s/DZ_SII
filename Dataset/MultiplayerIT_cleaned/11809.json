{"name": "Formula Extreme", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/formula-extreme.html", "text": "Gameleons is a rather young team of developers, but already boasts a large and varied catalogue, of which Formula Extreme represents only the latest arrival. It's a racing game clearly inspired by Formula 1 but without an official license, in which we'll be able to get behind the wheel of eleven different single-seaters and compete on the seventeen tracks present. As in any product of this kind, the choice of team and car does not influence performance on the track, which is determined solely by our driving skills and the choices we make before racing. In this respect, the Gameleons title is quite complete and accurate: accessing an event does not simply mean challenging the other drivers by trying to overtake them, but implementing a strategy that modifies the behavior of the car both for the qualifying session and for the actual race. own. Whichever way we decide to try our hand (single race or championship), we will have to set up the car and therefore modify the values relating to the tire compound and set-up, immediately checking the variations that these choices bring to the values of final speed, acceleration, road holding and fuel consumption. We will then be able to take to the track, complete our fastest lap and then enter the race in the position we have conquered. Formula Extreme adopts a simple and immediate driving system, with the automatic accelerator that allows us to concentrate only on setting up the bends: for the narrowest and most dangerous ones it is necessary to brake, while the others can be tackled calmly at full speed. At the top of the screen there are two bars, one relating to the integrity of the single-seater and one which indicates the fuel available: both are consumed (the first with collisions, the second only when moving) but can be restored during pit stops . The management of opponents, very important in games of this type, unfortunately leaves something to be desired: you can see an opposing car from a certain distance and therefore avoid an impact, but you rarely overtake without any problems. Furthermore, the presence of the automatic accelerator on the one hand simplifies the controls but on the other it puts us in difficulty when we have to face tight bends or get back on track after an outing: the brake is not particularly effective in this sense. The technical realization of Formula Extreme is of a good standard. The developers have adopted a classic approach for the genre, therefore with bitmapped cars on a polygonal scenario that includes the track and contour elements. And the results are really good: the track runs quite smoothly and without slowdowns, and there are just enough objects so that you don't feel like the background is stark. The cars are also quite well done, even if they don't shine in design or detail, and the colors have been used in the best way. As far as the sound is concerned, the effects are completely missing but instead of them we have a series of well-made music and an independent volume adjustment from the telephone (which is always convenient). The control system, as mentioned, is really simple and immediate: just press the joystick to the right or left to steer, the 0 button to brake and possibly the 1 and 3 buttons to make the bends by braking. The car responds to inputs quickly and you can handle it in all situations, apart from when you go off the track or need to adjust speed in tight corners. Formula Extreme is also equipped with a multiplayer mode via bluetooth, which allows us to challenge a friend. PRO Technically well done A good number of modes Some guessed solutions AGAINST It can be very cumbersome Limited gameplay Multiplayer is missing", "date": "2007-11-21", "grade": "S.V."}
