{"name": "Rise Of Nations", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rise-of-nations.html", "text": "The main facts Rise of Nations, like many other strategy games about similar ones, projects us into a dimension of history spanning entire centuries, during which our main task will be to colonize the world, alone or in the company of some (faithful ?) ally managed entirely by the program's artificial intelligence. In the immense Campaign of the single player game, called ~Conquer The World Campaign~, the progress of time during the Campaign is marked by the ~eras~ whose departure is established at the beginning of each game turn, during which we can some fundamental choices for our final success. These choices, which will be purely random in the initial stages, are identified as follows: military invasion, a request for an alliance, the purchase of land not militarily occupied, or in the event of a military invasion, we are granted the possibility of receiving particular ~advantages ~ in the use of specific previously purchased bonus cards. These initial planning phases have a tendency as the game progresses, to become rather monotonous, but above all they tend not to reflect the real situation of domination impressed by our diplomatic skill and our strategy as a leader; sometimes, it is preferable to immediately enter into conflict, thus rewarding our strategic ability, rather than choosing to skip our turn. Brian Reynolds, founding father of this game, tried to insert elements taken from his previous works (Civilization II and Alpha Centauri) but in my opinion he didn't quite manage to integrate them perfectly as one would have expected. The turn-based mode lacks a valid strategic study, limiting itself to purely military decisions concerning the choice of which country to invade, while the phases of a diplomatic nature remain unfinished, and do not interfere, for example, with the economic choices or with the actual international political roles, which they could have exercised a decidedly more fulfilling and socially more important role, given the nature of the long game Campaign. The game suffers from the lack of appropriate sound effects, which do not give the awareness of being owners of the most modern technologies in the audio field, leaving us with that ~old~ and ~already seen~ feeling that inevitably accompanies our video games and unfortunately the the same fate is dedicated to the music, which not shining for originality inevitably pass into the background. Battle or gameplay? The choice to enter into conflict with a neighboring nation inevitably projects us to play the game, in real time and as per the best tradition, on the typical game map to which we have all been accustomed for some time now. Depending on the invaded territory, whether it belongs to a typically Nordic, desert or equatorial nature, the map will consequently draw the counterpart in textures, on which we will become familiar with the game's extraordinary gameplay, absolutely prominent. The guys from Big Huge Games give us a truly satisfying game depth, the extraordinary control of the troops takes place with extreme ease in interacting with our mouse; the program recognizes the military troops from the civilian ones, avoiding, in the presence of numerous overcrowdings and automatically, the selection of the latter and allowing immediate control without useless deselection clicks. On the screen we will have to deal with an impressive number of units and there will be sieges, which on more than one occasion will give us a lot of trouble, forcing us to make sudden retreats, or quick raiding actions to disorient the enemy. The assault on the capital of the enemy nation, fundamental in the economy of the game, does not take place with the simple destruction of the building, but with a precise occupation by the infantry units and the subsequent maintenance through an inexorable final ~countdown~, the whose duration has been set in the maximum limit of two minutes, at the end of which the success or failure (in case we lose the building) of our military occupation will be determined. Particular mention for the artificial intelligence implemented in the game: depending on the degree of difficulty selected, we can only find real satisfaction in the interaction. In particular, an artificial ~routine~ has been developed with a sense of ~hit and run~ by our truly amazing ~virtual~ antagonist, we will not fail to notice how skilled he is in ~pinching~ our defensive system on one side of the border, withdrewgoing to his own once he has fulfilled his duty as a ~spoiler~, to then punish us elsewhere with a powerful attack on the most unguarded side of our defensive system, forcing us to perform real sleight of hand in an attempt to avoid the worst . Equal treatment is reserved for civilian units, which will enjoy the possibility of automatically deciding according to the specific needs of a particular resource, thus satisfying the needs of the village and leaving us full freedom to control our army and the development of military technologies, civil, commercial, and scientific fields of our nation. Another peculiarity introduced in the game (in addition to the possibility of playing a ~quick battle~ or some specific timed missions) is a very particular and original function called ~attrition damage~; it is in all respects a technology that allows you to implement additional damage, when enemy units cross our border: the damage suffered is indicated with particular red flashes that surround the affected units. All the typical features of strategy games are also present, respectively the commands for the waypoints along a specific route and the different attitudes of the units, which vary from defensive to aggressive, are implemented, in addition to the condition bars, which show in time the state of health of our troops is real. Economy Each civilization, following the example of other games in the series, will have dedicated units or particular advantages deriving from a specific technology; the game offers us the possibility to choose one of 18 nations, including the glorious civilization of the Roman Empire. There will be other civilizations whose knowledge was made possible by the now ancient ~Age of Empires~: Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, Mongols, English, French, Germans, Aztecs, Incas, Spanish, Russians, Greeks, Nubians, Egyptians, Turks , Maya and Bantu, will offer, beyond the embarrassment of choice, very interesting challenges with civilizations divided by profound structural differences. The production of units, buildings and the progression of upgrades in the Library is entrusted to the accumulation of resources, which in this game number six: food, wood, metal, oil and wealth; as well as the possibility of accumulating ~rare resources~ (tobacco, cotton, horses, minerals) which are nothing more than particular precious goods to be offered to the nation, receiving further economic aid in exchange. Resources are randomly scattered throughout the game map. The development of our nation is based on the first city built (the capital) which represents the heart of our economic-military system. The empire develops scientifically and economically through the upgrades foreseen in the library, and progresses in the possibility of building new cities. The creation of new towns is of fundamental importance, as it allows to expand the territory of our nation, therefore an enlargement of the borders, to increase the total number of units and to establish new trade routes in order to further increase the sixth fundamental resource present in the game: wealth. The buildings that it will be possible to build can be of an economic or military nature or have a specific function, such as the wonders of the world and libraries, or a whole series of buildings aimed at improving the increase of our resources. Once upon a time... 3D Rise of Nations has been developed with a sophisticated ~3D-like~ graphic engine and adopts the classic isometric view, by means of which the only operation that can be performed with the wheel of our mouse is the zoom, which has the unique advantage of allowing you better control of your units. It's a pity that when you need to control something, such as 120 or more military units, during bloody and ferocious clashes, the aforementioned function is really of little use, and you won't be late in maintaining the visibility of your game map in full screen. The strength of this game certainly does not lie in the graphics and in the choice of textures used to ~paint~ the long work of ~Big Huge Games~. Each artwork comes with themed colors and tones, the buildings are pleasant in their architecture and some of you will soon find similarities with those of ~The Conquerors~, the units depending on the chosen nation are presented with the clothes they belong to , and even the mechanical means undergo the same chromatic effect, as well as the environments in which we will be called to combattere, will be typical of the localities to which they belong; as a result we will have desert lands, islands bathed by the sea and totally snow-covered mountain resorts. In the long run, however, all the game maps (especially in the ~Campaign~) will look totally alike, depriving us of the pleasure of always discovering new areas and the sense of ~deja-vu~ will not take long to appear after a few hours of play . Although the Big Huge Games product does not shine for the ~choreographies~ and for the refined graphic peculiarities, to which the latest innovations in the technological field are accustoming us, I also found a certain heaviness in the use of ~medium~ systems, for example during the management of multiple cities, without getting to control huge armies which the game slowly gets used to, believing that a good graphics card and an excellent processor are highly recommended especially for online enthusiasts, differently from what is indicated in the minimum specifications on the package. Probably a better optimization of the graphic apparatus would have been welcome, the idea of having in your hands a game that does not wink at the refinements that our graphics cards would like, but which still needs to be fully enjoyed, is not convincing. very powerful computer. Rise of Nations develops a large part of its potential in online matches, where the enthusiasm in facing fierce human opponents represents the real fulcrum (in my opinion) of the game. This time, however, we will have to forget about the never-forgotten Microsft Zone servers, to rely on the slightly less efficient ones of Gamespy, a carefully considered choice, but almost unjustifiable to the most loyal players of Microsoft products. The maximum number of players that can be challenged on the same game map is counted in number of eight, there is also the possibility of challenging each other through a local network (LAN) or as a last offer there is always the internet, through a connection with an IP address. Conclusions Bryan Reynolds must be acknowledged for having tried to create something new, strategy games have probably reached the halfway point and need new oxygen. Rise of Nations proudly succeeds in ferrying the player to the new world, within which economy, diplomacy, economic relations and culture play a fundamental role. Rise of Nations is passionate, and like a magnet it will extend your hours of play far in time, giving you the feeling of mastering, despite some sudden crashes and some annoying bugs, a nation, yours, which will make you protagonists to this day. Let's forget the individual units as the absolute protagonists of the game, no heroes, no prima donnas, no story told: in the game you are the real protagonist, you have the task of redrawing the world borders, you have the precise duty to structure your nation, to you the total management of your empire and the honor of arms. The potentialities offered by this game are innumerable, you will not struggle to discover them by yourself and those who practice online as a religion will have infinite offers available to master an entire nation, unfortunately and I say this as an enthusiast, an unpleasant sensation is palpable in this work in a hurry, without which a great masterpiece would have kept us company in the years to come. Pros: Intriguing, captivating and absolutely winning gameplay The multiplayer could be addictive 18 nations, each with its typical characteristics The hours to play it will never be enough ... Cons: Graphic engine poorly optimized Multiplayer multiplayer requires great computing power A few bugs too many A missed masterpiece: the rush to publish it got the better of it ...a walk through time The synchronization of human activities is a structural and fundamental aspect of the civilizations that have followed one another over the centuries, of which we have then known the customs, religions and characteristics thanks to the numerous historians and their translated archaeological finds. The term History indicates the narration of the facts of men, socially and politically constituted; and is usually divided into three important definitions: biographical, if it tells the life of single individuals; special, if it narrates the facts of single races; and universal, if it tells the most important political or social events from the most remote times. In modern times, it is now established that history, the one imprinted in textbooks and told in author's books, has now become a cornerstone of an equally form of entertainment: the one told in videos", "date": "2003-06-16", "grade": null}
