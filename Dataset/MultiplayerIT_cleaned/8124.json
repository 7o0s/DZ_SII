Yet it would be interesting to know how many of them have actually had at least one experience with pen and paper role-playing games, who has ever done even once the Dungeon Master hidden behind a big D&D manual, RuneQuest and Vampire the Masquerade. Made by the Brazilian team Behold Studios, Knights of Pen & Paper was created not so much to recreate evenings with friends sitting around a table, but rather to pay homage to the experience made of imagination, interpretation and complete freedom of choice. Of course, we are still talking about a video game, but the way it is presented and some curious ideas undoubtedly manage to make inroads into the most nostalgic. The company of the d20 Once one or more characters have been created, the player realizes that his adventure actually takes place inside a bare room of an apartment, where a group of boys are gathered around a table. However, it is when the Dungeon Master begins to tell the story that a fantasy setting populated by hostile creatures and dungeons full of traps takes shape. The user constantly finds himself switching from the role of DM to that of heroes: not only must he embark on a series of more or less difficult fights or decide the path to take, but he must also choose the missions that involve the protagonists or the type of opponents they find themselves having to eliminate. But be careful not to misunderstand, because leaving out some small privileges and some insignificant decision-making choices, the freedom to shape the adventure, typical of the Dungeon Master, does not find much space in Knights of Pen & Paper, presumably to meet the need to maintain a gameplay and an intuitive interface, simple and accessible even to the less savvy player. Thanks to a sort of subjective view, the turn-based combat system is reminiscent of classic JRPGs such as Dragon Quest and Fantasy Star, but those who have spent hours and hours in D&D sessions will probably feel the impossibility of moving tactically in a battle grid. Obviously the skills and characteristics of your heroes depend directly on the class chosen during the creation of the character, ranging from the paladin to the magician, from the druid to the warrior, from the cleric to the thief, with others that can be unlocked during the adventure. Speaking of unlockable content, the guys from Behold Studios have tried to add as much meat to the fire, giving the possibility to use the collected coins to buy embellishments for your bedroom, decorations for the characters and even Dungeon Masters of the caliber of Yoda and Splinter; not to mention that, continuing on your journey, you can obtain additional classes such as the barbarian, the bard and the necromancer, or you can unlock the five members of the development team and use them as playable characters. The complexity of the experience depends a lot on the number of controlled characters and their class, prompting those who have practiced to add new heroes with less traditional classes to the party. One of the major critical points is represented by the inevitable presence of in-app purchases: although they are not intrusive and although it is possible to easily end the adventure without using a credit card, a minimum of grinding becomes necessary to accumulate enough money to spend in travel and equipment. Although not free-to-play, the game inherits other small elements when it comes to forging your own equipment from the blacksmith: in this case the user is forced to wait a certain amount of time, but if it is partly a curious and original addition, on the other hand it could make those who hate the waiting times typical of the freemium model turn up their noses. Where Knights of Pen & Paper wins, however, is in its innocent humor made up of funny dialogues and extremely nerdy details that reveal the passion of the authors themselves for paper role-playing games. The sometimes uncertain narration and with some errors by the DM is just one example, but one cannot smile in creating a party of players composed of a hipster, an alien, the grandmother and the pizza delivery boy, each characterized by coherent and bizarre. The same alternative modes are presented through real game manuals, and everything is told through a pixel art that is not too elaborate but which undoubtedly has liveliness and charisma, flanked as usual by a soundtrack made up of chiptune music and retro themes .", "date": "2012-12-10", "grade": "8.0"}
