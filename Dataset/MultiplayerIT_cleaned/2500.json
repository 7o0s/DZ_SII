{"name": "The Bouncer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-bouncer_a.html", "text": "Squaresoft opens a cafe? After the unfortunate Driving Emotion: Type-S, a Gran Turismo-style racing game, Squaresoft is back on PlayStation 2 with a title of a genre more in keeping with the long tradition of the Japanese software house. The Bouncer was born, essentially as an action/RPG, from the mind of Tetsuya Nomura, already creator of the characters of masterpieces such as Final Fantasy VII, VIII and Parasite Eve. Since the first images shown at last year's E3, The Bouncer captured the attention of all the media thanks to a game concept and graphic quality hitherto unthinkable for a video game. Thus the expectation for a game destined to become one of the flagship titles for the Sony console grew spasmodically. Last January, the Japanese version of The Bouncer finally made its debut on PlayStation 2, however, arousing conflicting opinions and even some criticism. An inconsistent longevity and some graphic defects formed the basis for an unexpected rejection. Mom, I want to be a bouncer! A few days after the release of the PAL version and after having played the game intensely for a week, I can safely say that the definition ~Play Action Movie~, coined by Squaresoft, is well suited to The Bouncer. Characterized by a mix of role-playing, action and scrolling beat'em up, The Bouncer comes to us with all it takes to conquer the European market. We have three different modes available: Story Mode, Versus Mode and Survival Mode. The Story Mode is nothing more than the single player mode. Following the kidnapping of Dominique, we will have to face a series of levels packed with malicious warriors of the Mikado Corporation before we can reach the building where Dauragon Mikado, the cold and ruthless president of the company, resides. The fisticuffs abound and we will happen to fight in a forest in the moonlight, on a moving train and even on a spaceship. In pure RPG style, by winning the many fights in the game we will buy points that we can use to enhance the fighting skills of the three main characters. In fact, we will be able, depending on the situation, to choose to control Sion, Volt or Kou and be supported during the clashes by the remaining two bouncers. Scrolling beat 'em up? The RPG component of The Bouncer proves to be more than valid, being able to offer the player a significant incentive not only for completing the game but also for subsequent repetition. By finishing the story mode once, twice and even more, we will have enough points to increase the skills of the individual characters, transforming them from simple bouncers to true martial arts masters. Added to this is the fact that depending on the character we will use, we will be presented with different aspects of the story and even different endings. However, the fights are the predominant part of The Bouncer. What's better than a healthy and regenerating fist fight? Despite the limited number of moves available in the first game, the spectacular clashes with the many and varied opponents will bring to mind scenes from famous action films or historic scrolling beat 'em ups. The 256 levels of pressure on the analog keys of the PlayStation 2 joypad do their job very well, guaranteeing us a variable power of the strokes and even different moves depending on the pressure exerted on the individual keys. However, all this does not prove to be sufficient both due to a plot that is not completely credible and compelling and, above all, due to the disconcerting brevity of the story mode. In fact, you can complete the game without too much difficulty in just over an hour and a half, of which at least half is dedicated to watching, albeit excellent, computer graphics scenes. To partially save the boat, the Versus Mode comes to the rescue, really well done, and which will allow you to compete in 11 arenas (taken from the levels of the game) with 3 of your friends. Among the usable characters, in addition to the 3 protagonists, we also find Dominique and all the opponents beaten during the Story Mode. We wanted to surprise you with special effects... Aesthetically, The Bouncer presents itself to our eyes with the magnificence of graphics of a quality rarely seen on consoles. The realization of the characters often leaves you stunned, as well as the numerous and very fluid animations of which they are characterized. The settings, on the other hand, offer a discreet glance while not excelling in sharpness and choice of colors. The much-vaunted motion blur is certainly not a fast defectidiotic and, although far from being a merit, decisively underlines some of the most spectacular scenes. The sound does its part without infamy and without praise. We would all have liked the Italian dubbing of the dialogues but unfortunately we have to settle for a discreet, and understandable, English and the canonical Italian subtitles. The music is of a good standard but almost takes a back seat, covered by the thunderous sound effects of the fights. The implementation of Dolby Digital 5.1 technology should be commended even if it is only present in the cutscenes. Balance time... It is not easy for me to express a definitive judgment of this game. The Bouncer has certainly disappointed many of the expectations and hopes that flourished during development. Most of the elements that make a game a must-have masterpiece are present here, but the very thing that makes a game eternal is missing. The negligible duration of the story mode, albeit mitigated by the versus mode, subtracts many of the merits of Squaresoft's work which has managed, however, to recreate top-level graphics and winning playability. In conclusion, I judge The Bouncer to be a good product which certainly cannot be inserted in the ranks of unmissable titles but which can offer intense entertainment to fans of the genre and above all to those who have multitaps and three friends. It is quite natural now to expect a sequel to this game. The appointment is therefore for the next adventure of the most famous bouncers in the history of video games! Pros: Amazing graphics Versus mode well done Fighting is always satisfying Cons: Too short Plot not excellent The Fate bar seems to be an oasis of tranquility and the silence of the room is interrupted only by the voices of some boys. Three handsome bouncers (translation of Bouncer) carry out everyday work and seem almost bored by so much peace. The youngest of these, Sion, is preparing to begin his shift when the exuberant Dominique enters the scene bringing with him a precious gift for his beloved friend. Exactly one year has passed since Sion picked her up in the street, alone and scared, and opened the doors of her home for her. Suddenly the quiet of the Fate bar is interrupted by the violent irruption of some masked men, who with a terrifying blitz kidnap Dominique and vanish into thin air. Sion can't do anything to stop them and after a few seconds of bewilderment she sets off in search of her missing friend with the help of the other two bouncers, Volt and Kou. The kidnapping involves the Mikado Corporation, an avant-garde company in the energy sector and working on a satellite energy production system. But what links Dominique to the Mikado?", "date": "2001-05-30", "grade": null}
