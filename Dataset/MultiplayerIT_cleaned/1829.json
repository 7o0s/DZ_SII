{"name": "Otogi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/otogi.html", "text": "[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] I look like a woman but I'm not a saint. Our warrior's way of fighting is effective and elegant at the same time. Don't be fooled by Raikou's effeminate appearance and graceful movements, he's still half-demon (and luckily on our side!). At the beginning there will be only two types of attacks and your trusty katana to carry them out, but as you progress through the levels you will be able to buy new weapons, armor and spells to cope with the enemies which will proportionally increase their danger, also because each level will have different enemies and of different demonic class. You will start off defeating minor demons like griffins until you get to Shutendoji. The attacks will vary depending on the weapon you are handling, but will still be limited to two buttons on the pad; more than a limitation, it's an aid in generating as many combos as you can to take down enemies. Raikou unfortunately does not have the ability to fly, but the speed with which he performs the combos allows him to hover in the air with some ease. The double jump will serve its purpose of course. Furthermore, the possibility of destroying everything on the screen greatly satisfies the player, who will be thrilled to see how the warrior cuts a piece of mountain like butter. As if that weren't enough, if the demon is nearby at that time, receiving the boulder on his head, he will perish, or at least, be injured. This rule obviously applies to everything that surrounds you such as trees, houses, monuments. Be careful, because the enemy must be nearby to get hurt, it is not allowed to throw debris from a distance. Pure playability, that's what this videogame gives us, and action and thrill make Otogi a new experience and ready to set new standards in action games. The music implemented is poetry: despite being in stark contrast to the game action, it hypnotizes and caresses the eardrums like no soundtrack heard in a video game (they can hardly be heard like this in the best film productions). It is traditional Japanese music, but with motifs so refined that they never bore the listener and that blend perfectly with the medieval setting of which the game is pervaded.

I didn't write the title at random, it's not a joke. I say this only because the latest From Software productions have been simply mediocre and not very innovative. Perhaps this software house has finally found its way; enough with the mechs, it's time to bring out the imagination and re-evaluate the fairy tales! All this preamble to introduce the technical comment: don't be frightened, it wasn't to distract you, but to strengthen the judgment that will follow. A few words therefore: the best title created by From Software, and not only from a graphic point of view. I don't know if it's the console that helped them, but these guys have implemented all the special effects that can be inserted into a video game: particle effects, bump mapping everywhere, real-time reflections, lights, shadows and above all, the levels they are entirely in 3d and full of polygons on screen. Play it at least on normal to find out. The characterization of the character is particularly accurate, he has something demonic due to his physicality (he's white enough to scare a ghost!), but he also has the most beautiful hair and armor ever seen. His movements are fluid and fast enough, the fights are slightly confused, which are disorienting from time to time due to explosions and motion blur. The special effect that generates the appearance of our hero in each level is beautiful and of great impact: he will appear generated by a vortex of peach flower petals! Poetic isn't it? Everything travels on the canonical 30 fps, but as usual, at the risk of repeating myself, it's better to follow the action and enjoy the fight, rather than guessing the movements and not understanding what happens in front of you, especially if the title is particularly frantic. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Christmas gift ! Yes, the tested version is the Japanese one, but fortunately the menus are in two languages. I wrote ~Christmas gift~ because I gave myself this title right at that time. There is little to comment when a game is as well done, fulfilling and fun as Otogi. Until now, many had dreamed of a game that could arouse emotions like Ico (unfortunatelypo appeared only in the PS2 version), but no one expected that this could come from From Software. A title to be purchased without reservations, and which will make you want to be played again (and don't be too surprised!) even if only to listen to the graceful accompanying music again, and not just to complete the explorations of the levels at 100%. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] The history of videogames teaches that the best-selling and most publicized game is not always necessarily a masterpiece...... Like the phoenix reborn from its ashes, From Software returns to amaze us, and it does it in style by giving us a title destined to make people talk about itself for a long time ! Says the wise.. O.TO.GI can be freely translated as FIABA, specifically the fairy tales of the Muromachi and Edo period. It is inspired by the world of legends of the Helan period, which takes place between 794-1185 BC The protagonist is called Raikou: in fact it is a precise historical reference to Minamotono-raikou who, according to a 12th century legend, defeated the demon Shutendoji (among other things, a demon present in the game, as well as the protagonist of a very famous anime cartoon that has the title of Shutendoji) on Mount Ooe in the Tanbano region. The atmosphere of Otogi is gloomy, and gives the feeling of being in hell, so much is the presence of the evil one felt.", "date": "2003-01-08", "grade": null}
