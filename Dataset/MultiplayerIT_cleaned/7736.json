On the one hand there is the small independent production that winks at the past with a minimal graphic design that recalls that of some primordial classic shooters (Xevious above all), on the other there is the will to remain in modernity with the use of twin sticks (a la Geometry Wars) and 3D graphics. But the ambivalence does not end there, because playing it turns out that there are many other elements that fluctuate between the present and the past, such as the waves of enemies that recall those of thirty-year-old titles which are contrasted by a system of power- quite articulated up, given the title, which forces you to make precise configuration choices of the spaceship. In short, the more the Brain Slap Studio title is played, the less clear it becomes which is the predominant soul, the one that should then represent the fulcrum of the playful experience. Whether this is good or bad can only be told by examining Hexodius as a whole. But let's go in order. The game is divided into two macro sections. In the first you find yourself driving the protagonist spaceship (recommended by a nice robot) on one of the general maps that make up the levels. Divided into hexagons (without any strategic claim) they must be explored by tackling the individual missions, entering the shops to spend the accumulated money (at the end of each mission a judgment is assigned determined by various factors, which yields different sums) and carrying out a series of activities collateral like finding scanners that indicate the key hexagons to reach to move forward on the map, or activating a checkpoint to save the game. Of course, the core of the game is the missions. Each mission has its own specific objective, i.e. it may involve resisting enemy waves, destroying some generators, protecting your robot friend while hacking a terminal, and so on. From time to time it will be possible to face bonus missions, which smell strongly of 16-bit, to accumulate credits to spend on upgrades and repairs (they consist in guiding the robot towards the recovery of some energy cells). Arrived at the end of a map you will have to face the classic boss to reach the next level. Chemtrails All missions, except the bonus ones, take place in rectangular arenas of various shapes. Each map has different elements, depending on the objective to be achieved and the entrances from which the enemies enter. For example, in robot defense missions there are often rails on which particularly tough turrets run, or in generator attack missions there may be protections of various kinds that try to prevent us from carrying out our duty (mobile barriers, turrets and etc). Then there are environmental elements that depend on the world in which you find yourself. For example, in the maps of the world of fire (the third), there is an incandescent pit from which enemies leave trails of flames in a similar way to what Tron's motorcycles did. Just the enemies represent the fulcrum of the action. There are different types: ranging from the simple rotating disk that points to the player's spaceship, to the snake that must be hit on the head to be destroyed, passing through tanks that shoot homing missiles and strange vehicles that can only be destroyed if hit in the back. A large number of enemies equals a good number of weapons and various trinkets. In addition to the basic cannon there are extra weapons to activate, such as very powerful mines, a flamethrower, an EMP wave, a timed turret that can be placed anywhere on the map and many others. And there is no shortage of passive upgrades, which perhaps increase the effects of active weapons, or make the spaceship more resistant and faster. In addition to their nature and number, there is a substantial difference between weapons and upgrades: the effects of the latter are always active while the former must be unlocked in each mission. Doing so is very simple: dead enemies leave energy cells which, if collected in the right amount, unlock extra weapons in the order chosen before the start of the mission. Scrambled aliens In short, despite the underlying simplicity, Hexodius has several interesting elements to offer. Unfortunately it doesn't fully convince where it should shine: in action. As we said above, Hexodius seems to have many souls, but this multiple nature penalizes him in several ways. Meanwhile, having included a campaign has made it necessary to increase the difficulty of the missions very gradually. Played on hard, we managed to get through the first two worlds without ever dying. This translates into several hours of gameplay ptry to overcome missions very slow and with few enemies. Had we not persevered reaching the third map we would have written about a title that is poisonous in its repetitiveness, in which the frenetic nature of the twin stick shooters has been thwarted in the structure. Fortunately, as you progress, you discover really hard and demanding missions, which begin to demand greater skill from the player thanks to stronger and more numerous enemies. However, the memory of the first remains indelible, overcome by standing practically still. From this point of view, the decision not to put a boss in the first world also proved to be penalizing, a fact that made the impression of initial ease even stronger. Let's also include some Tafazzian choices from a technical point of view to understand why Hexodius requires a certain patience to be appreciated. Firstly, the visual style, ambivalent between old and new, is anonymous and obvious. Also from this point of view the situation improves in the advanced levels (we wonder why for the demo, which should have a promotional purpose, the first world was chosen, i.e. the ugliest from every point of view...), but we are already at the second request to the player to remain calm. The aspect that doesn't improve is the soundtrack, really awful. The accompanying music is unlistenable and anonymous, while the sound effects would have disfigured on an Amiga 500 game. We understand that this is a very small production, but here we are on really low levels like we haven't heard for years. More than retro, the soundtrack is a bane.
