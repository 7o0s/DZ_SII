{"name": "Way of the Samurai", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/way-of-the-samurai.html", "text": "The ways of the samurai are (almost) endless Way of the Samurai revolves around a narrative structure that is only apparently sparse and unattractive: the player in fact plays the role of a ronin (a term that indicated Japanese warriors without a master) who, having arrived in the apparently peaceful village of Rokkotsu, immediately becomes involved in a clan war for possession of the territory. So far nothing transcendental. But the power of the Acquire title lies in the wide decision-making freedom offered to the user and in the various repercussions that the latter's choices lead to narrative development. Put simply, Way of the Samurai allows the player to literally choose the path for his digital alter-ego to follow, leaving him free to decide independently whether or not to engage in a duel, whether to join one or another faction, or still whether to betray one's comrades or remain faithful to the cause. The various possibilities of action are presented to the user within the dialogues with the various characters present within the adventure; conversations with the population therefore play the double, very important role of making the plot known to the player (who is initially totally, and deliberately, unrelated to the facts) and of allowing him to decide his own path through a system of multiple answers. It goes without saying that different choices lead to equally different plot developments, which in turn lead to the six different endings available. Furthermore, depending on his conduct in the game, the user is rewarded with different kinds of extras, such as new clothes, weapons and faces for his character, customizable at the beginning of the adventure precisely through these parameters. The decision to make similar incentives available to the player to replay the adventure several times is certainly not accidental: from a narrative point of view, the events of the village of Rokkotsu are exhausted in two days, roughly equivalent to two hours of play. That's right, Way of the Samurai is finished in a couple of hours. But precisely for the deliberate choice of the Acquire developers, whose aim is to encourage the user to replay their product over and over again, in order to explore each different narrative development and experience all the possible ~ways~ of the samurai. The honor and the burden The focal point of Way of the Samurai is the combat system that manages the frequent clashes with white weapons that mark the natural narrative progress of the Acquire title. Vaguely similar to what has already been seen in Bushido Blade, the duels in Way of the Samurai turn out to be fairly ~technical~, strongly focused on exploiting the block and the opponent's imbalance, and decidedly far from the more basic slash'em ups (such as example Onimusha). Initially equipped with a simple sword and a very poor set of moves, the player can, during the adventure, collect new weapons and upgrade them from the village blacksmith, as well as learn a vast series of blows that can be performed through key combinations in the most classic style beat'em up. Still in favor of replay value, weapons and moves earned in one game can be used from the start in the next. As we have been able to see up to now, therefore, Way of the Samurai is a conceptually extremely fascinating title, unfortunately undermined in practice by a long series of flaws which it is impossible to overlook. First of all, the Acquire title lacks a graphic look up to the hardware on which it is developed: pop-ups, drawn in, dull textures, woody movements and angular polygonal models are certainly not a pleasure for the eye, just as the terrifying historical anachronisms caused by the look of many characters are not (samurai with afro hairdo, or dressed in leather jackets  la Squall Leonheart, or even ninjas with dreadlocks and tight-fitting shirts and blonde fighters with plunging necklines, high heels and foil are not exactly what one would expect from a title set in the Meiji period). The sound sector is also poorly cared for, reduced to a minimum in the exploration phases and guilty of an absurd rock musical accompaniment during the fights. But that's not all: Way of the Samurai also suffers from a bad English translation, a terrifying save system, an all too limited scenario, a fallacious lock-on of the opponents and a superficial characterization of the characters. Conclusions Way of the Samurai is, in conclusion, a title built around an excellent concept, which, due to the many defects listed above, fails to reach a quality level worthy of the exceptional nature of the basic idea. We therefore find in our hands a title of justdiscreet, which cannot fail to instill in the user a deep regret for the sensational wasted opportunity by Acquire, which however was able to demonstrate once again its indisputable creative vein. Now all that remains is to hope that in its next title the Japanese team will be able to combine a good concept with an up to date technical and stylistic realization. Pros Original and decidedly captivating concept Well-finished combat system High replay value Cons Absolutely not up to par technical realization Deplorable stylistic choices Awkward control and saving system Uninspired characterization After the very valuable exploits with Tenchu and its sequel on PSX, the Japanese developer Acquire inaugurates its journey on the Sony black monolith with a title which, like the now famous ~ninja simulator~, is proposed as an absolutely atypical. It is no coincidence, in fact, that this Way of the Samurai was distributed in Europe by the Eidos Fresh Games label, created specifically to promote Japanese products with an original concept in the old continent. But while undoubtedly loaded with a large number of innovative ideas, Way of the Samurai fails to fully convert them into a completely satisfying video game.", "date": "2002-11-26", "grade": null}
