The latest piece to arrive is one of the smallest, a stuff pack, entirely dedicated to bowling. How well are our Sims with skittles? Let's find out in the latest bowling expansion! The track of dreams In the hierarchy of The Sims 4 expansions, Bowling Night is in the ~lowest~ step being a Stuff Pack: the object packs in fact introduce elements both in the Buy and Build and in Create a Sim modes without however adding significant gameplay variations, and as 'it is easy to understand the leitmotif of this package is obviously bowling. The highlight among the 55 available elements is undoubtedly the bowling alley, which can be found in the ~Activities and skills~ section in both the ~recreation~ and ~physical activity~ sub-categories; the object by its nature is a bit cumbersome, to be precise fifteen squares by three, but each single track can be placed side by side without losing space in the middle and thus creating a single thread. The track can also be included in both a residential and communal lot, an excellent activity both for an evening out and a very luxurious whim to show off in a villa or penthouse in San Myshuno. Although this object can be placed in any type of lot without restrictions, spontaneous groups of Sims will form around the tracks only under certain conditions, or by inserting at least two tracks in meeting places such as bars, night clubs or lounge bars. Once the object has been placed in the lot, four different options will be selectable: ~play bowling~, for an ideal solo game for training, ~play together~ to play with your group of friends and ~invite to play~ which once selected, it will open the relative curtain to allow us to select the other Sims to invite. The fourth menu item, which differs from the others because it does not concern the social sphere~ is ~Activate lunar bowling~, an option that changes the color of the lane from a simple wooden lane with scoreboards to a futuristic and colorful one with lights fluorescent led; this change of look is perfect for all environments that can be visited both during the day and in the evening so as to be able to change the entire atmosphere of the room in just one click, even if within a community lot it can only be activated in specific times, shown in the item description.As we all know our Sims need to practice and learn a lot before they can perfectly master a particular skill and bowling is no exception, for this it will take a lot of training before becoming pros: so, similarly to what happens for other various objects, when our Sims play bowling both alone and in company, their Plumbob will transform into the usual progress bar.Other small nice details of this object are the scoreboards, which at each shot will indicate the quantity and position of pins hit, than the automatic banks for children: in fact the Simmers will be able to have fun playing bowling just like the grown-ups but during their games an automatic bank will be activated which will prevent the balls from ending up in the side channels. It's so retro! It wouldn't be a proper stuff pack if objects and clothes were missing from the appeal and in fact the collection is decidedly generous: 55 additional elements of which 20 for the Create a Sim mode and the rest for the Buy and Build mode. The style chosen for the look and furniture of the expansion is slightly retro and in pure American style: bandanas, gloves, patent leather shoes and striped shirts will all fit into our Sims' wardrobe, without however denying a touch of modernity and a bit of kitsch in pure Sim style, why yes: we are sorry to give you this news but Hawaiian shirts have been banned from the fashion code since... practically always! But precisely on the kitsch question we would like to spend a few more words, because we have seen many objects of bad taste in The Sims and expansions are perhaps the moment that the developers prefer to offer us rather unusual objects (someone remembers that abat jour a form of Hawaiian dancer in The Sims 2 Vacation Expansion?) but that trend has definitely abated in The Sims 4, and Bowling Night follows suit as well. Although there continue to be objects andquite bold clothing, most of the contents present are elements of character and which reflect the style of the expansion but which never expire in the tacky; in this stuff pack, in particular, it can be seen in the furniture which, although they follow an exquisite retro style, are sober and perfect design pieces both for embellishing a room and a residence, armchairs and coffee tables that look good both in the lounge area of a bowling club and Don Draper's swanky office. It is a choice that after years gains a strong consensus, especially among those players more interested in the construction and furnishing of homes than in the social life of their Sims and we expect that whatever the theme of the next expansion will be, this choice will be continued.", "date": "2017-04-03", "grade": null}
