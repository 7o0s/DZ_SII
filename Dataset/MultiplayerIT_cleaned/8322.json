{"name": "Un gradito ritorno?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108501-pro-evolution-soccer-2013-pes-2013-un-gradito-ritorno.html", "text": "There was a not too distant time when PES and FIFA represented the paradigm of the different way of understanding football video games, with the former identifying the perfect simulation in the eyes of the fans, and the latter instead constituting the symbol of a more simplified type of game. Over the years things have radically changed and the transition to the current generation of consoles has not only marked a change of trend between the two rivals, but as far as Pro Evolution Soccer is concerned it has also been quite traumatic, because from then on the series has struggled to establish itself, among other things veering towards a more arcade vein and carrying all those ~historical~ defects on its back for the resolution of which it seemed that the necessary effort was not made on the part of the developers. Fortunately, things seem to be changing, and already last year with PES 2012 the first positive signs were recorded for a turnaround again in simulation which, if confirmed also in this year's edition, could allow the saga to look optimistically also to the future. Because Konami has understood that to return to the levels that belong to it, perhaps it is appropriate to take a second path that can offer gamers a different perspective on football games, more immediate and fun on the one hand, but without forgetting at the same time those aspects that move towards realism. And it is from this idea that Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 was born. not for some extended options and some refinements. Therefore, as always, friendlies, the most important club championships and the related international cups, including the much-loved Champions League, can be played. Then there are the various tournaments typical of the series, those for the national teams and the Become a Legend mode that pairs with the Master League in the Football Life section. Lots of irons in the fire The latter in particular is the one that has been retouched the most in terms of options: in this edition the coaches make their appearance and a whole series of tools are added, such as for example the possibility of buying specific objects to enrich the program of training of the team and of the individual athletes with new exercises useful for improving the players in specific skills, which increase the depth of this accessory component but a source of interest for many users. Do not miss the specific training section where you can learn all the gameplay news through an interesting and complete tutorial that includes three challenges for each manoeuvre, and the one relating to extra content, from where you can download the updated squads and access a sort of internal shop through which you can buy everything you need to further customize various aspects of the game. Maybe through the usual, excellent internal editor. As far as online is concerned, unfortunately, as often happens when one is lucky enough to be able to analyze a title long before its release in stores, one must also take into account the fact of having to pay some duties, specifically that of not being able to test too much thoroughly the network game modes. By force of circumstances, therefore, considering that the title is not yet fully connected users, even in the case of Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 we are forced to illustrate the characteristics and potential that we could see from our test, asking disquisitions more in-depth on balancing, lag and so on at other venues. The game on the net is conceptually similar to the one seen in the previous episode of the series, with myPes for Facebook, with ranked matches, tournaments and the community, which instead has been embellished with several new features which include an improved interface for managing menus, chat/bulletin boards that are more ~friendly~ to use and, in the second case, full of information such as the total number of games and victories among the players in the group, etc. However, the beating heart remains once again the Master League Online: the latter finally enjoys an advanced matchmaking system that allows you to divide players into rankings according to their skill level: in this way you can create more balanced and proportional to the degree of experience of each user. Ultimately, even if the choice is not comparable in completeness to that of the competition, for multiplayer on the network, in this 2013 edition we are faced with a new evolutionary step for the series. And now, after talking tanof menus and modes, the time has come to take the field. Licensing issue Pro Evolution Soccer still fails to match the overbearing domain of Electronic Arts in the field of official licenses, even if the Konami title can boast the complete ones of the Champions League, UEFA Europa League and Copa Libertadores. Full license also for the Eredivisie, Spanish Liga and Ligue 1 championships, almost total for the Italian and Brazilian Serie A (in fact, both lack the official names and the Lega Calcio and Brasileiro logos). The English championship is still out of the game: although the players' names are all faithfully reported, the only team to appear with official names, flags and uniforms is Manchester United. Almost the same situation for the Portuguese tournament, with only four teams covered: SL Benfica, SC Braga, FC Porto, Sporting CP. Negative note also for the rosters of the teams, unfortunately not all perfectly updated: Konami has however ensured that the latest market changes in the squads will be implemented through a patch that will be released in a short time. A renewed game PES FullControl, ProActive AI and Player ID are the names behind which the three key elements of the gameplay of Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 are hidden, those who sanction a further positive evolution in this sense. With the first, the gamer has almost total control of the virtual athletes on the field, which translates into the possibility of executing shots (including precision ones) and passes completely manually, obtaining more natural and credible trajectories. In fact, manual management works quite well, and it is very easy to dose the power of the same, even if, especially for the first ones, a lot of practice is needed to direct the conclusion towards the goal and obtain results, given that their success or less depends on several factors including the foot used to strike the ball, running speed and direction, body position or the physics of the ball which continues to be one of the flagships of the series. Still on the subject of control of the players, it should be highlighted the fact that they respond more immediately, even if not always perfectly, to the commands given to them to also carry out the new stops to follow, the triangulations, the dribbles with which to get around the opponent and sudden changes of direction. The latter, although not taking place in a very fluid way, do not seem to suffer from the conspicuous delays of the 2012 edition. We are not yet in the sphere of complete freedom without rails, but by limiting ourselves to the PES series such a level had never been reached, and this in Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 seems to be able to guarantee greater variety in the composition and construction of an action. Just the variety, together with the above control, is in fact another point on which the developers have insisted a lot. Here the so-called ProActive AI comes into play, the new artificial intelligence specially designed for this edition and capable of making teammates and opponents move more intelligently. The way in which the teams act in relation to the technical caliber of their men, the schemes adopted and the general potential of the team they face, especially at the highest difficulty levels, but also the reaction of the individual athletes in relation to the movements performed by the athlete controlled by the user, is something that in the recent past was rarely seen in PES. Seeing, for example, Barcelona adopting a type of game that rewards ball possession rather than long balls or crosses from the flanks, or Juventus players attacking spaces in a convinced manner to suggest a through ball when Andrea Pirlo has the ball makes the idea that there are people on the field who are ~alive~ compared to 2012. Defense is everything Similarly in the defensive phase the virtual athletes are closer to the action and better read the movements of the opponents, resulting consequently more attentive in marking, in anticipation but also in those movements in aid of the colleague in difficulty by running for a double ( recalling the teammate as always with the appropriate button), or to close on a possible cross by positioning himself between the ball and the rival striker. Not everything always works properly, especially in the air, but certainly the current one has nothing to do with the much (rightly) criticized artificial intelligence of the defenders and the defensive line of the previous chapter accused of being too low and far from the opposing attackers . To all this is added an interesting feature that gives more truthfulness to the action and recalls the tactical defense of FIFA in a minor key.In the cover phase, pressing the right back RT/R2 will allow the defender to move while always keeping his eyes turned to the ball, so as not to waste time turning around should it be necessary to make an intervention: by pressing the A button twice (X on PlayStation 3) you can sink a tackle bent forward, which if on the one hand can be decisive for removing the ball from the attacker's feet, on the other it can prove harmful, given that once wrong you can leave the green light to the Totti on duty. Important here, in addition to the timing in the intervention, is the improved system that manages the tackles, which takes more account of aspects such as the running, the balance and the size of the players engaged in the hand-to-hand fight for the conquest of the ball. To complete the picture relating to the gameplay there is then the aforementioned Player ID, or a behavioral system that makes that of the most famous players within the game more likely. With it the various Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Robben, Iniesta, Neymar and so on and so forth, for a total of about fifty players (in the future this list will be enriched starting from PES14), are recognizable not only in appearance, but also in the way they run, act and ~think~. And it actually seems to work quite well. Basically, someone like Xavi always knows how to manage and get the ball rolling while his partner Puyol won't hesitate for a moment to take advantage of his physicality and ability to anticipate to throw himself desperately on the opponent's striker launched into the net, as well as the acrobatic strikers of Real and Santos will obviously not disdain personal action, targeting defenders to jump them and try to finish towards goal. Xbox 360 goals PES 13 gives players twenty-eight achievements. To get them you have to fulfill the game's requirements in various modes both online and offline, such as winning the first friendly against the CPU, the Champions League or one of the other international cups, making your professional debut in some official competition or becoming captain in Become a Legend. triumph in a tournament on the network and so on. Apt atmosphere In the face of many improvements, however, there are some deficiencies that undermine the overall judgment. Having said a little above of the tracks that have not been totally eliminated, some automatisms remain which continue to show themselves in some actions and in certain plays where the computer has a hand in it, things which tend to create a rift between those who appreciate or dislike this gameplay, however ~piloted~ in certain aspects. The behavior of the goalkeepers, although improved, sometimes appears rather strange and it is not difficult to see a full defender perform a real miracle on a close broadside only to then get caught like a chicken due to a badly executed and unnecessary rebound, especially on the balls low. For the rest, all that we have described above on the match played is embellished by a cut for direction and replay worthy of a real television production, which, especially during official events such as for example the often mentioned Champions League, gives back to the users all the atmosphere of the competition and the feeling of really participating with your favorite team. Still on the subject, applause goes to Konami for having increased the set of animations of the athletes in order to give them even more amalgamated movements than in the past, even if objectively in this sense we are not yet at the level of the competition, and to have once again managed to do a great job in making shirts and player faces. Very commendable is the ~treatment~ reserved for the players of the Italian teams, with the presence of the real faces of players such as Vidal, Bonucci, Maggio, etc. Ups and downs instead for the stadiums, which are for the most part only average. As far as the sound is concerned, the choirs are good, less fake than in the past and much more ~synchronized~ in terms of rhythm and variety with what happens on the pitch, with greater audience participation during the action characterized by different tones of cheering and applause or boos more or less convinced, just as the commentary is beautiful, once again entrusted to Pierluigi Pardo and Luca Marchegiani. The rhythm of their commentary appears more continuous and dynamic than in the recent past, especially obviously when tournaments covered by official licenses, cartel matches and competitions in famous stadiums are played. In fact, it is precisely in those situations that the duo of reporters shows off a good variety in the sentences that accompany the various moments of the match or in the introductory parts of challenges such as Barcelona-Real Madrid or the Milan-Inter derby.", "date": "2012-09-17", "grade": "8.9"}
