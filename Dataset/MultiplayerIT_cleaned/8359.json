{"name": "Michael Jackson: The Experience", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/107671-michael-jackson-the-experience-annie-are-you-ok.html", "text": "Michael Jackson: The Experience can easily be cataloged as a ~universal~ title which, given the release on practically every type of platform, has been able to give moments of relaxation to many of the inconsolable fans of the King of Pop. Its widespread diffusion has had the merit of reaching practically every type of player but, inevitably, it has caused some controversy among those who consider the intense exploitation of his image excessive. Indeed, it is true that it is certainly not ethics that rules in business, on the contrary, but it must be said that Ubisoft has generally proposed products that are (almost) always valid, especially the versions with support for Kinect and Move. At first glance, however, this transposition for iOS platforms might seem more like a last-ditch attempt to extract money from the category of fans without a console but no iPhone or iPod; a potential target which, considering the numbers involved, probably represents the majority. Beat It! In Michael Jackson: The Experience obviously you have to try to interpret some of the most famous choreography of the famous artist, using only your fingers. The chosen interaction system is in fact based exclusively on touch and the only way to perform a song at its best is to perfectly repeat the commands suggested on the screen. Like the most famous musical games, in time with the music you will therefore have to perform vertical, horizontal or oblique slides, being careful to release your finger at exactly the right moment. The correctly performed step allows the virtual Michael Jackson to perform one of his legendary movements, on the notes of some famous songs; the difficulty of the steps is then directly proportional to the complexity of the ~swipes~ imposed on the fingers. In addition to the simple vertical slides mentioned above, it is possible to perform even simpler movements with a ~tap~ or more complicated movements with 180 or 360 degree turns. The factor that makes this mechanism immediate and intuitive is the freedom to perform all types of slides in any part of the screen, according to one's convenience. Increasing the difficulty of execution increases the speed and number of movements required, even having to perform two at the same time. The score is calculated on the basis of the degree of precision of the dances and the number of ~combos~ made, consisting of a succession of commands executed with at least the degree of ~OK~. It is true that in this version of Michael Jackson: The Experience the sung part has been effectively removed but the multimedia content of each single piece is truly exceptional: each video is in fact completely rendered and reproduced in computer graphics with ultra-faithful movements and details . Furthermore, the transition from the video part to the game part is natural and pleasant, managing to involve the player right away. In essence, one has the feeling of experiencing firsthand the video clips that helped create the legend, all while holding only a smartphone between your fingers. The big problem concerning this production, however, is the too small number of tracks included in the purchase, only four, which forces the buyer to put his hands in his wallet to add at least historical pieces such as Billy Jean or Black or White, whose lack is frankly inexplicable. Not to mention Thriller which, after hours of play, didn't even appear as a paid track, thus fueling the insane doubt of its total absence despite a mention among the Game Center achievements. The work carried out on a technical level, as already mentioned with regard to the multimedia content of the individual songs, is remarkable, starting with the response of the commands and ending with the exceptional animations, which can be admired more carefully during the freestyle periods always present in the course of playing the songs. Maximum gaming satisfaction is obviously obtained by wearing a good pair of headphones, the only ones capable of fully enjoying the songs of a real pop legend.", "date": "2012-08-28", "grade": "7.0"}
