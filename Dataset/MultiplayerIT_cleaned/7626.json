{"name": "Tassi in famiglia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123174-shelter-tassi-in-famiglia.html", "text": "From the first years of school, children are taught how nature keeps itself in balance thanks to the harsh law of the food chain: in a world made up of prey and predators, the strongest survives. Not who is smarter or wiser, but who can defend themselves better and get food. Aesop's fairy tales and their morals have no place in the brutal reality of the animal kingdom, and the cruelty of nature is the theme behind Shelter, the new game created by the indie team Might and Delight. This time the Stockholm developer has decided to move away conspicuously from the frenetic and traditional gameplay of Pid, to instead experience an experience that is less easy to interpret, much less playful but decidedly more suggestive. Shelter is like an Animal Planet documentary, but in this case the player experiences firsthand the tough adventure of a badger mother and her litter. In Shelter we face the animal kingdom in its most brutal and cruel form The Adventures of the Little Wood In the dark depths of her den, mother badger is making sure none of her five cubs are missing. The woods are teeming with wolves and hungry creatures, and who knows what would happen if one of them decided to venture outside. Luckily the offspring are complete, but one of them is lying on the ground, weak and emaciated. ~Maternal instinct,~ if we want to call it a screen instruction, thus prompts the parent to pull a root out of the ground and feed the half-dead badger. The effect is that of spinach for Popeye, and a moment later you see the puppy bouncing left and right. But the den is now running out of supplies, and the furry little family has to go into the woods in search of other food. The goal of the Swedish developer is clear from the first moments. Putting the player in the role of a mother means pushing him to take care of her puppies, but at the same time the challenge is to stimulate human emotions, albeit within the fur of a wild animal: through gameplay mechanics and predetermined events, Shelter tries to instill love and anger, relief and fear, but to tell the truth, it doesn't always succeed. As soon as you put your paw out of the den you are quickly introduced to those basic rules which for better or worse are repeated over the course of the hour needed to complete the game. Taking a running start and hitting a tree will cause a fruit to fall, moving in tall grass allows you to hide from prey and predators, while a click of the mouse emits a call to attract the attention of the puppies. Judging from the first few minutes, one almost gets the impression that feeding the small badgers represents Shelter's main objective: a short time on an empty stomach is enough and the hungriest animal wastes away and loses its colour, warning the mother that it is time to run take cover. Luckily for the family, but sadly for the gaming experience, catching up on a snack is anything but difficult; each level is overflowing with fruit, roots, frogs and foxes to eat, and it's nearly impossible to go hungry. Might and Delight probably wanted to avoid making Shelter a frustrating adventure, but in this way the sense of anxiety and the urgent need to look for food that would probably have highlighted the survival component of the game was completely lost. Removed the urgency to feed the puppies, what remains are the other dangers that can put their survival at risk. Whether it's a wolf hidden in the darkness of the night, an eagle flying menacingly over a moor, a fire set in the woods or the impervious waters of a stream, it doesn't take much for one of the puppies to stay dry. And, when it happens, it's impossible not to feel a little disappointed: the developer has also differentiated the fur of each animal to make sure that the most attentive player knows which of his young has disappeared. In replaying the adventure we noticed that the save system allows you to easily restart a level and recover lost puppies, but Shelter is an experience that must be appreciated without cheating, possibly in a single and uninterrupted session. The loss of a puppy should be a tragic and irreversible event: the player regrets it, but then continues trying to be more careful than before. Being able not to get distracted is difficult, it must be said, and several times it can happen to stop to admire the fascinating setting created by Might and Delight, simple in its low-poly graphics but absolutely rich from a stylistic point of view, with the final result it stands halfway between a children's illustrated book and a Japanese painting. Where Shelter fails resoundinglyhowever, you is precisely in its original objective, failing to seriously involve the player on a purely emotional level. Accomplice, as already mentioned, is the too low level of difficulty, which does not communicate any sense of tension both in the search for food and in the phases of survival from predators. Added to this is a narrative that underneath is superficial and predictable: not only does it fail to fully underline the gravity of the loss of a child, but it unintentionally ends up preparing the player for an ending that is not at all unexpected.", "date": "2013-09-13", "grade": "7.0"}
