{"name": "Rise and Fall: Civilt in Guerra - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rise-and-fall-civilta-in-guerra-recensione.html", "text": "The Rise and Fall of Rick Goodman Rick Goodman's name turned into a rising star in 1995 when he, along with his brother Tony, created Age of Empires. They were the legendary Ensemble Studios. Soon after, Goodman leaves the group and founds Stainless Steel Studios, with which to embark on the conquest of the most successful peaks. In 2001, under the new banner, he created Empire Earth, in which he let the gameplay of Age of Empires merge and amplify it along a timeline that starts from prehistory and reaches a distant future (through the expansion), where the fights take place in space. Therefore, the comparison with that sacred monster of Civilization is inevitable, despite belonging to very different genres, due to the epic nature of its historical development. If you wish, you could say that Empire Earth was the version of Age of Empires that Goodman wished he had made. Empires: Dawn of the Modern World was released in 2003. Although the game pattern revolves more or less always around the same heart, this time the time span is smaller, embracing just one millennium of human history, from 950 to 1950 AD. Note that, so far, every game from Stainless Steel Studios has the word Empire in the title. After a collaboration for Immortal Cities: Children of the Nile, Goodman got back to work on this Rise and Fall: Civilizations at War (also note here the reference to famous titles of the past), which unfortunately ended prematurely due to the closure of the company, a fact of which Goodman accuses Midway. The game and the news Rise and Fall (Civilizations at War, subtitle), presents itself in a somewhat ambiguous way. Who among us has not noticed the mention, in the name, of two strategic classics such as Rise of Nations and Civilization? In fact, the connection was almost natural and underneath the expectation was created, a bit subtle, of being faced with something that combines those who are considered, by many, as the greatest representatives of the strategic genre, both shifts that in real time. Marketing jokes, of course. this new Midway product attempts a courageous and almost reckless marriage between two very distant genres The game and the news Expectations and marketing jokes aside, RaF (henceforth referred to as this, for brevity) looks like a traditional RTS, with the usual resources to collect, buildings to construct, units to produce, improvements and everything else, to which, however, a treatment based on joypad pills has been prescribed. The novelty that immediately catches the eye, as big as the mountain that didn't want to go to Mohammed, is the possibility of controlling the heroes directly on the field, in third person, like any 3D action. Imagine, then, taking your trusty Julius Caesar (who among us doesn't have a trusty Julius Caesar at hand?) and launching yourself, slashing and slashing left and right as if you were Russell Crowe in full mystical fury, across the enemy multitudes, cutting them down inexorably, like ripe wheat. Are you still there? No, it's not Prince of Persia review, still tune in RaF. Jokes aside, this new Midway product attempts a courageous and almost reckless union between two genres which, if they are not totally opposites, are certainly very far from each other. The strategic part is decidedly traditional, with two resources to collect, wood and gold, necessary to build buildings and produce units, plus a third, glory, necessary to obtain special benefits, such as increasing the level of heroes or being able to choose a counselor who supports us in our tasks. The presence of the councilors is the classic little accessory that works. These are various characters, each of which is able to ensure game bonuses, such as increasing the morale of the troops or the speed of gathering certain resources. To hire new advisors, accumulated glory points must be spent. The rest has already been seen, the granary is built to increase the maximum number of citizens, the barracks are built to train the infantrymen and archers, the stables for the knights and walls and towers to defend our small (at the beginning) outposts . [C] Elephants are really huge, especially when seen up close. Hitting the guide is the best way to hit the guide. essential if these behemoths are to be brought down. Some missions will all take place in third person. The result is very cinematic, but has nothing to do with an RTS. [/C] If, previously, we could advance through successive epochs, this time we will advance through the levels of the hero. The form changes but the substance is the same: a higher level hero grants new buildings, more upgrades, new advisors and everything in between. When the hero will have asufficient level of resistance (at least 20%), the player will be able to take direct control of it, in third person. Controlling the hero means enjoying an enormous privilege and equally enormous advantages over the enemies. The hero can exterminate an entire opposing phalanx in a short time and can pull down the archers defending a wall with a few precise bow shots, he can also gather all the nearby soldiers and send them into a charge, however the The hero must be careful of his stamina, which will inexorably drop, until it becomes so low that the player is released from direct control to return to RTS mode. When health runs out, a hero cannot die, but is taken off the battlefield for a certain amount of time and then returns regenerated. Controlling the hero means enjoying an enormous privilege and equally enormous advantages over the enemies Another novelty, certainly more coherent and attractive than the previous one, is that relating to naval battles. During battles on the water, the ships will not have offensive power, but will be platforms capable of producing and transporting the same land units. To understand each other, we can march our archers on the deck of a trireme and our infantrymen on the deck of another trireme and send them to attack the enemy ships. The archers, more backward, will attack from afar, while the infantrymen will be able to launch themselves against the enemy ships and conquer them. Eventually we will replace the fallen by producing new soldiers, directly on the ships (a somewhat imaginative solution indeed). Specifically, with ships we will be able to perform two particular actions: ramming and boarding. Ramming occurs when the opposing ship is within a certain angle, with respect to the perpendicular to our course, and results in the immediate sinking of the target. A very powerful tool which, fortunately, has been mitigated by the intrinsic difficulty of being able to position the opponent in the ramming area, which is very limited. The effect of the sinking ship and the survivors who fell into the water, trying to keep afloat, is very nice. Of course you can target them with arrows. Boarding takes place via the grappling hook. Once the grappling hook has been built on the ship, it will be possible to hook the opposing vessel, flank it and build a bridge between the two. At this point, our bloodthirsty troops will throw themselves at the throats of the unfortunate adversaries, who - obviously - will succumb in an instant. It is undoubtedly a decidedly original way of understanding battles by sea and very well done. Kudos to the developers. [C] An entire army prepares to board the departing vessel. We will be able to have our soldiers fight aboard ships, as if the battle took place on land. Cleopatra and her army. The amount of of detail & egrave; really high and the landscapes beautiful to see. The cutscenes are cutscenes made with the game engine and not in real time. Compression is not; of the best. [/C] An in-depth analysis What has been said so far can make many of you mouth water and surely RaF is a game that has a lot of potential. It must be said, however, that it is not all rosy. The abandonment of Stainless Steel Studios, and the subsequent intervention of Midway's internal team, was a blow to the development of the game, which showcases angularities and defects of a certain weight. sometimes the difficulty arises caused by the work done by two different teams An in-depth analysis Visually RaF looks good, the reflections of the water and the waves are very convincing, the shadows lengthen on the sinuosity of the ground, there is an abundance of grass and, in general, the look is quite saturated with colours. The larger units and ships are full of detail and well done animations. The level design is rich and the maps well articulated, however on some occasions the frame rate has been shown to be uncertain and the loading times are long. In short, every now and then the difficulty arises caused by the work done by two different teams. The management of the camera is initially cumbersome and you almost always have the feeling of not being able to view everything as you would like, but after a while you get used to it. Placing a door on a wall is impossible, if that wall hasn't been built with pinpoint accuracy, i.e. if it's not built on a single row of blocks. The pathfinding is tricky at times, the AI goes up and down, but still average to other RTSs. the introduction of the advisers is certainly one more variable to take into account and the depth of the naval battle system adds to what has been seen so farAn in-depth analysis As for the direct control of the hero, don't expect a game within the game, you won't find special hits, combos or bonuses, you can't even jump, but you can exterminate hordes of enemies with great ease and in a short time. The third person mode is simply a fun added value, which also doesn't affect the difficulty balance too much, as the control typically takes place for short periods (the time necessary to discharge the hero's energy), then you have to return to RTS mode. In campaign mode, we will find missions designed to be played exclusively in the third person, this seems excessive to us, after all, RaF is a strategic one and whoever buys it expects to play a strategic one, while these missions only in the third person demean fun and, among other things, they are not easy either. The introduction of advisers is certainly one more variable to take into account and the depth of the naval battle system adds to what has been seen so far. The siege phase of the defensive perimeter of the opposing towns is fun and adrenaline-pumping, although initially cumbersome, and being able to scale the walls and fight on top of the stone ramparts is certainly a good point in favor of the game. The more traditional RTS part defends itself well and the multiplayer mode, up to eight players, combined with the skirmish one, offers a decent range of options capable of customizing the games according to your preferences. It's just a pity that there aren't many maps and the random generator is missing, on the other hand we have a beautiful editor with which to give vent to our imagination. Final comment What about this Rise and Fall? Stainless Steel Studios' virtual testament could have been better, but sadly they didn't have time to finish what they started. What we have in our hands is an excellent RTS, where we can control as many as four civilizations (only two in campaign mode), build walls that are finally scalable and on which we can even fight. The battles on the sea are finally proposed in an original and innovative way and the third person control of the heroes is a pleasant addition. Detractors will turn up their noses at this last feature, but we can't help but recognize the courageous attempt to shake up an all too static genre. These innovations are welcome, if they are well integrated into the global context. Ultimately, Rise and Fall is a solid RTS with interesting news and a new and fresh way of dealing with naval battles. The multiplayer is there and it's done well, the editor as well, so that we can indulge ourselves in creating new maps when the ones available are no longer enough for us, the skirmish mode is a good way to train offline and the two campaigns allow us to appreciate the scenographic side of the game, with their scenarios full of detail and variety. ' dancer Long and boring third person missions Use the Starforce Let's take a step back, maybe two It was 1995 when Ensemble Studios released what was the relaunch point, the slingshot effect, of the strategic genre: Age of Empires. As a result of the great success achieved, one of the two founders, Rick Goodman, leaves the team and founds Stainless Steel Studios. Under this new brand comes the ambitious Empire Earth, a game that dramatically expands the gameplay of the Age of Empires series, bringing it to rival Sid Meier's great Civilization in terms of epic grandeur. For the newborn developer, the road becomes uphill and the production of titles, although of high quality, always settles on the usual pattern, revisited each time in a different way. Goodman's great obsession seems to have been the search for a philosopher's stone that would revolutionize the RTS genre again or, better, that would revolutionize its creature, that genre derived from Age of Empires and which had undergone so many successive manipulations but never lose its primitive essence. We needed something different, something that made a sort of strategic next-gen, something that created a new slingshot effect for the genre. Something totally unexpected. Rise and Fall, for example. Who would have ever dreamed of inserting elements taken from a 3D action into a traditional RTS? Driving a hero in the third person for example... Then came the showdown, Stainless Steel Studios couldn't make it and collapsed under the weight of an inexorably red balance and, with it, the obsession collapsed.", "date": "2006-07-10", "grade": null}
