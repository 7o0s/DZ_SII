{"name": "Pokmon Smeraldo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-smeraldo.html", "text": "Emerald gameplay As in almost all the adventures set in the world of Pokmon, these too see the player impersonate a young Pokmon trainer, on his initiatory journey around the Hoenn continent in search of Pokmon to capture and train, to become the best in the world and aspire to the prestigious title that awaits those who defeat all the great Gym Leaders, conquering their medals. However, unlike the first Game Boy and Game Boy Color episodes, the GBA chapters feature a slightly more complex and compelling storyline: not only is there a world to discover and many trainers to defeat, but also an apocalyptic threat to face. If in Ruby and Sapphire this was represented by Team Aqua and Magma and by the two Pokmon that they tried to awaken, Kyogre and Groudon, due to the cataclysms, in Pokmon Emerald the centrality of the adventure is even more noticeable: threatening Hoenn is in fact Rayquaza, a divine Pokmon capable of truly unleashing the end of the world. To stop it, we need to obtain the power of Groudon and Kyogre, and here we see Team Aqua and Magma involved, to whom we will have to prevent them from capturing the two (not so much) Pocket Monsters. However, the plot is a mere pretext to start the journey of our alter-ego: Emerald is played exactly like all the other Pokmon and, more precisely, like Ruby and Sapphire. Therefore, many elements that characterized the two Advance episodes return, without however making substantial changes to the already well-tested gameplay, such as the 2 against 2 clashes, which if in Ruby and Sapphire were unfortunately really rare, in Emerald they are much more widespread. There are always more than 250 Pokmon to capture (again, owning the two Game Cube games, Pokmon Colosseum and Pokmon XD, helps complete the PokDex) but only six at a time can accompany us on our raids: choose your team it's always an extremely strategic undertaking, in spite of those who say that Pokmon is a game for children. Pokmon is, and remains, an extremely complex atypical RPG beyond the mere unbridled level-up, and in Emerald this is especially noticeable when facing the brand new side-quests, especially the final ones, where the player's tactical skill is required at the highest levels, along with a deep knowledge of each creature, its stats and abilities. Graphic & Sound Pokmon Emerald has minimal differences from a technical point of view, compared to Ruby and Sapphire. Although the hardware is not squeezed to the maximum as happened in similar two-dimensional titles such as Kingdom Hearts, Golden Sun 2 or Mario & Luigi, the audiovisual performance is excellent: the locations are very well-kept and full of details, approaching the graphic style to The Legend of Zelda. Everything is peaceful and colorful, and there is no shortage of touches of class such as sandstorms, images reflected on pools of water and so on. The animations on the field are spartan and limited to the little that the sprites do during exploration, while in the fights between Pokmon they have just been added: missing in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald the large and well-kept Pokmon sprites enjoy a few frames of animations, nothing earth-shattering but still pleasing to the eye. On the sound side, the remixes of the classic themes of the series are excellent and the various music always accompanies you, both in combat and on the march: cheerful, carefree, they perfectly match the rhythm of the game, without ever annoying or being intrusive. A clear example of how the aspect is marginal compared to the gameplay, but also how this can be equally taken care of without an extravagant search for excess. Pokmon Emerald is not a must buy for those who already own Ruby and Sapphire: collectors shouldn't do without them, but those who have already experienced their share of adventures in the Hoenn continent can easily do without them. The differences between the three versions are marginal, even if Emerald is the most recommended for those who have not yet had to deal with Kyogre and Groudon: the amount of sidequests more, the new Pokmon to capture and the more incisive presence of a storyline are in fact a plus for the new edition of Pokmon. Emerald is probably the swan song for Pikachu and associates on Nintendo's Advance, waiting for Pokmon Pearl and Diamond on DS, an opportunity not to be missed for those who have not played the first two Pokmon ~Advance~. A notable flaw should be noted: the absence of the add-on that allowed, in Leaf Green and Fire Red, to exchange one's Pokmon or fight with friends wirelessly, although this option is supported. Not bad for those who own one of the two aforementioned titles, a problem - which can be compensated for by a more traditional link cable - for all the othersthe. Pros: Proven gameplay More variety than previous versions Stronger plot Cons: Too similar to Sapphire and Ruby The mechanics are starting to tire No add-on for wireless connection Each generation of Nintendo handhelds has been accompanied by a pair of video games dedicated to Pokmon. In the days of the Game Boy, it was the turn of Pokmon Red and Blue. The Color edition of the Game Boy was home to Pokmon Gold and Silver (still considered the best episodes of the series). For the Game Boy Advance, it was the turn of the Ruby and Sapphire versions. And life goes on, it seems, with the now confirmed development of two new titles for the new DS. But each ~pair~ of Pokmon has always been followed by an extra episode, a special edition that summarized the two games a bit, seasoned with some extras, both technically and in terms of gameplay: Yellow for the first two, Crystal for the following. It is therefore not surprising that Pokmon Emerald is connected to Sapphire and Ruby: of both it maintains the excellent gameplay, the technical realization over the top and even those small defects on which those who do not appreciate Pokmon will hardly be able to fly over.", "date": "2005-11-16", "grade": null}
