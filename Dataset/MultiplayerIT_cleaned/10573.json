A celebrated genre but gradually suffocated by the thousands of clones that have multiplied thanks to the low cost and easy popularity. From time to time, however, some rare pearl appears which, for care and completeness, manages to stand out from the crowd by claiming a fair amount of merit and attention. COGS is part of this small group in its own right. Do you remember the game of 15? You certainly had it in your hands as a child. It is a rather widespread mechanical solitaire, at least until recently, whose origins date back to the end of the nineteenth century. As the name suggests, the basic version consists of a square with fifteen numbered tiles arranged along four rows and four columns. A space remains empty and allows the dowels to slide. The goal is to sequence the numbers in as few moves as possible. COGS is its digital evolution. A type of evolution that its creator, Sam Loyd, would hardly have imagined back in 1878. Just complex The simple solitaire imagined by Loyd explodes into three dimensions. The square becomes a rectangle, then turns into a cube, a prism, a cart, a contraption. There are pipes to be connected to launch spaceships and there are gears to be positioned to give life to music boxes, clocks and mechanisms of all sorts. The puzzles increase, one for each face of the object, and connect to each other generating impressive patterns that not only connect different floors but also develop in depth. Gears that develop over three levels and pipes that wind horizontally and vertically are not uncommon, building puzzles that, at least at first glance, are able to displace even the most savvy gamers. Luckily for us, for five years the guys at Lazy 8 Studios have worked hard on a fundamental item for this genre: difficulty. COGS is exquisitely balanced and the decision to base it on a relatively elementary puzzle has made it possible to build upon it complex logical plots whose resolution is satisfying while remaining within everyone's reach. The matter becomes more complicated when the choice of timing intervenes. From time to time we will be called upon to replicate some melodies by chaining some gears connected to bells. In this case, simple logic is the basis of a process that calls us to correct the timing with which to produce a melody to the millimeter. In some ways it is a real challenge that mixes two different logics and it is also the only case in which the typical puzzle game nervousness can peep out in COGS. A little gem Fifty levels, unfortunately not many for a puzzle game, to be tackled calmly or with the sometimes fearsome limits of the time challenge or with a maximum of available moves. Each puzzle solved gives 3 to 10 gears that make up the currency with which to unlock the next challenges. A structure that allows you to face the game in full relaxation but which also allows you to challenge your limits and your masochistic side. If you find yourself low on coins don't despair, there's always the option to solve one of the older puzzles to earn enough to progress through the game. The aesthetic system is extremely accurate and, even if it is a 10 dollar production destined for Steam, it is a pleasure to note the absence of recycled textures and quackery justified by the low cost. So much so that even an inflating balloon or a ringing bell enjoy certain simple but impeccable animations. Wood, bronze and brass evoke vintage science fiction and give life to the breath of an industrial revolution observed through the eyes of Jules Verne. It's surprising, and a little bitter, to realize that there's more atmosphere in a puzzle game than there is in many current generation titles. The audio however is limited. Of course the samples are perfect and contribute fully to the atmosphere, but they are very few. Nothing to say about the soundtrack. A single track for the menus but also in this case spot on and engaging. Finally, note the localization in Italian, by Lockworks, which allows for better use by all.", "date": "2009-08-15", "grade": "8.0"}
