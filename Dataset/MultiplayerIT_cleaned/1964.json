{"name": "Tetris Worlds", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tetris-worlds-2.html", "text": "The Neverending Story <br> Tetris was born in 1985 by the brilliant Russian mathematician Alexey Patijnov at the Moscow University. Like so many inventions destined to characterize the life of humanity, its genesis is almost casual, and in this case it is an intuition that the professor caught while writing some routines in Pascal useful for his studies on Tetryons. Having understood the effectiveness of the principle, Patijnov created a Pascal version of the game for use by his colleagues, who then pushed him to take care of a transposition on the PC, for which he was helped by a young programmer. The success of the game was so immediate and vast that one can easily believe that Tetris is present today on any electronic device that has even a basic and monochrome monitor. This is thanks to the few resources required and the simplicity of programming. The original was completed by Patijnov in only three days: meditate on this for a few moments and you will understand why everyone considers the Russian mathematician one of the most influential and brilliant minds of modern times. The unfortunate and bizarre side of the story is that Patynov got nothing from his invention: the copyrights at the time belonged to the government of the Soviet Union, owner of the ideas of all its scientists! Perhaps also for this but not only for this reason, today the mathematician lives in the USA and is an American citizen... After so many years of colonization of all the existing platforms at the hands of many more or less improvised software houses that jumped on the bandwagon of success, today the Blue Byte founded among others by Patijnov himself has regained the rights to exploit the Tetris concept, and Tetris Worlds is the first result. The Neverending Story <br> Playability: Variations on the theme There are three basic ways to play Teris Worlds: story mode, arcade and multiplayer. The story mode introduces a short story about the world of the Minos, an alien race of living cubes! The curious one-eyed beings face extinction due to the instability of their planet, and must colonize six outer planets that have been found to be habitable as soon as possible. The player's goal is to choose a planet and proceed to terraform it, to make it suitable for the creation of a Minos colony. The terraforming takes place through the overcoming of various levels of Tetris, and graphically results in the modification of the landscape of the planet, which will gradually become lush and luxuriant. The big news is that each planet presents an original variant of Tetris, proposing, for example, to free the screen from pre-existing structures that fit together with the tiles, or by proposing a gravity effect that causes the portions of the tiles that do not fit to fall in horizontal lines. The most curious variant for me is the one that sees the pieces made up of different colored parts, which in contact with pieces of the same color, are incorporated forming new and larger structures, which result in bonuses for the player. The worlds can all be tackled in random order and the progress achieved in terraforming is saved in order to update an absolute ranking and resulting in the modification of the planet's landscape, which you will find again the next game. The arcade version proposes a more traditional approach, based not on objectives but on the maximum score obtainable before filling the playing space with tiles. Finally the multiplayer: the players challenge each other on the same levels simultaneously on the screen, each one engaged in his own portion of the game, this time up to four simultaneous players using the multitap. The Neverending Story <br> The technical point Excellent in terms of color choices, pleasant to look at and beautifully complemented by mesmerizing music and sound effects, TW is an example of good programming. A few notes can perhaps be made on the 3D elements of the terraformed landscapes, which are not terribly successful, and Mino himself, his on-screen alter ego, is a little depersonalized, he does not arouse particular sympathy. But these are details that don't distract as much as the grace of animated backgrounds and user friendly interfaces works, and splendidly. Excellently done the performance rankings of the levels, which are essential in this genre of games. The only discordant note is the impression that the uploads are too long for the little graphics that are entered into memory. The romantic detail TW manages through the sound environment and the very soothing and friendly interface to relax you, recalling the magic of the great games of the 80s, when the user instead of being attacked by fi3D movies were cradled by a few magical jingles and essential chromatic effects. Those like me who have spent evenings suspecting hidden electronic worlds alive inside their own Amiga will understand what I mean. Conclusion Tetris Worlds is a tribute to a classic, but unlike the many precedents that have taken place in the past years, something different immediately shines through, an affection for the subject that translates into pure pleasure on the screen. Leafing through the names of the development team, you understand why: Alexey Patijnov is one of the game designers, and undoubtedly treats his pupil with all the pampering of a caring mother, where so many other producers have enslaved him by making him an easy money machine. If you love Tetris and you are not saturated with it yet, I believe this is the best Tetris commercially available, and with this I conclude. Pros  Great sound environment  Very relaxing and easily approachable  Well done gameplay variations  It's addictive like some games from the golden years Cons  Long loading  The history of Minos might seem ridiculous and forced The Neverending Story <br> Question: Who doesn't know Tetris? Although there are at most three or four hands raised on the other side of the screen in all of Italy, for the sake of completeness, I give a brief excursus on how to play this classic. Tetris is a puzzle based on reaction speed, or rather the quintessential puzzle of the genre, capable of finding the unexpected perfect combination of simplicity and infinite variety in the dynamics of the levels that involve the player in the long term. The aim of the game is to combine a series of tiles of different shapes but always based on the combination of four basic squares, to form complete lines on the screen that will disappear to make room for the new tiles arriving. The tiles fall from the top to the bottom of the screen and can be rotated as desired to be able to fit them in the desired way. The end of the game occurs when the screen fills vertically with tiles without the player being able to complete new lines to free up space. Simple? Exactly, the magic is all here, and I reassure the three/four readers above that one cannot help but be involved in it, seeing is believing!", "date": "2002-10-30", "grade": null}
