{"name": "The Settlers - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-settlers-recensione.html", "text": "German settlers The Settlers saga was born on PC way back in 1993, by the Germans of Blue Byte Software, who built a large part of their fortunes and visibility on the brand. The title was to be ascribed to the then nascent genre of real-time strategy but with different particularities, being given great emphasis on the collection and management of the various resources aimed at creating and enlarging a settlement, and much less on the war component which instead acted as mistress in all other competitors. The result was a much slower and more reasoned pace of play, the ideal link between RTS and traditional turn-based strategy games a la Civilization; perhaps this was one of the reasons behind the great success of the game, which prompted Blue Byte and Ubisoft, who later intervened as publishers, to produce five sequels over the years plus a remake, that of the second episode (1996) which is probably the most successful and the most loved by fans. It is precisely on The Settlers II, not disdaining however mechanics and elements born later, that this version for Nintendo DS is based, for obvious reasons of power of the machine and, as mentioned, of quality. In no time, therefore, you will find yourself managing a very wide range of activities German settlers Basically you will have to put yourself in the shoes of a small group of settlers grappling with a completely new and virgin land: you will start only with a headquarters that also serves as a warehouse where you will find the first, scarce resources, and from here you will have to build various buildings to exploit everything that the area makes available to you. The ~birth~ of the units is instead totally automatic, therefore you will never be short of workers, farmers, builders and so on, at least as long as you manage to give each sector the right amount of resources. The focal point of the game concept is precisely the search for and maintenance of a delicate balance between the various activities. At the beginning what you will have to do will be clear: your headquarters is located near forests and outcropping rocks and therefore there is the possibility of creating a ~base~ for the woodcutters and the consequent sawmill to create the tables necessary for the construction of the buildings, and a stone quarry. Soon, however, these first resources will run out and you will have to expand the territory: the barracks are responsible for this function. But be careful, the soldiers need weapons and money for wages: it is therefore necessary to build iron, coal, gold mines (not before having sent geologists to inspect a mountainous area), a forge to extract minerals, a workshop to forge weapons, a mint to create money... But the miners need food: hunters and fishermen will provide only the essentials, to create a solid base you will need farms of various types and all the ~laboratories~ (butchers, mills, ovens) to transform the raw material into a finished product. In less than no time, therefore, you will find yourself managing a very wide range of activities: you will not then only intervene on the production side, but you will also be able to decide things such as the distribution priorities of a specific resource, favoring an activity rather than a 'other; all without forgetting essential elements such as water collection or communications: each building needs to be connected to the headquarters to function, and if the distance is too great, flags must be placed at more or less regular distances which act as ~ temporary assembly centres~, so that each settler does not have to walk too far and thus slow down the chain. The DS goes to war You will also manage the territory in a ~topographic~ sense. In fact, you will not be able to build anything where you want: with a touch of the stylus you will access a screen that will tell you where it is possible to build what, as the various buildings are grouped into three orders of magnitude. It is not enough, because the construction of a building or a road, as well as the felling of forest and rock resources, will affect the immediately surrounding land, occupying it (two buildings can therefore never be very close to each other), or freeing it if of woodcutters and quarries. Understand for yourself that once you have achieved a very delicate balance perhaps in a very large area, where everything works for the best and all the settlers are working at full capacity happily ever after, the sense of satisfaction will be enormous. And, as it should be, the problems will intervene right here! Oh yes, because by expanding your borders you will sooner or later realize that you are not alone in the world (unless you have decided it in free mode), and that your neighborsthey have exactly the same needs as you: war will be inevitable. And the war, as well as the birth of units, including military ones, is managed completely automatically by the CPU: it's up to you to provide for the equipment and pay of the soldiers, who must be numerous and satisfied to fight as they should. needs to. All this is a source of unspeakable frustration, in the first games when you still have to get used to the concepts of the game: the game warns of nothing if not losses or conquests of barracks and related territory, and in fact there would not even be any necessary since, even if you were aware of an enemy invasion, you could do absolutely nothing in the short term if unprepared. However, losing even a single barracks could mean the direct end of the game, because perhaps all the food production activity was concentrated around that building: without food, the miners stop working, the workshops close, weapons are no longer produced and your civilization is irretrievably wiped out by history. All this is a feature that has always accompanied The Settlers, linked as it is to the choice of making unit management completely automatic, and has always divided the gamer population in two. If you have never approached the saga, only by playing, unfortunately, you will understand whether being a simple ~minister of production~ and not the demigod of Civilization and the like is in your ropes or not; the only certain thing is that you will have to chew a lot of bitterness in the first few games... Smuggle! Three modes are available to you: Campagna Romana sees you at the head of an expedition of Latin settlers shipwrecked on an island, consists of ten different chapters and a story to link them together, and it will certainly be your first port of call because it is also a tutorial to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and concepts of the game. On the other hand, the World Campaign takes place on faithful, and small, reproductions of the terrestrial continents, while the aforementioned Libera allows you to choose various parameters (world size, presence or absence of other civilizations) and to start playing without a particular objective if not to thrive. The crux of the whole matter is the interface: it is quite well done and you can do everything you did on a PC with strokes of the stylus and a few basic keys, to scroll the map and exchange content between the two screens. There are also defects, to be found mainly in the ~online help~ entry, which is fundamental in a game of this type: in some sections, by selecting an icon, you will not be told what it refers to, and if in some cases this is obvious, in others it is much less so. The tutorial above, then, simply indicates the order in which the various buildings should preferably be built: to understand why this order you will have to go there and read the description of each single building, available however only once construction has begun . The first sessions will therefore be a rather tiring series of readings and experiments: if you digest it, you will have tons and tons of hours of gameplay ahead of you, provided that the question of war and the intrinsic repetitiveness of the scheme do not disassemble you first. Furthermore, any multiplayer component is missing, which has always been very successful on PC. The first sessions will therefore be a rather strenuous series of readings and experiments Smuggle! The game features a good 2D, rich, colorful, detailed and sufficiently clear, which does not betray the very humorous and carefree touch that the saga has maintained up to the very last episodes; the engine seems to be able to manage quite easily very large maps full of buildings and settlers. The only music that should accompany you during the game is instead absolutely horrifying, due to its repetitiveness and technical quality, and it will take you two seconds to decide to eliminate it to make room for only the discreet sound effects. Among the defects of this version, the inexplicable presence of only one save slot should be mentioned: it will therefore not be possible to carry out several campaigns at the same time, and a series of bugs which, while not irreparably compromising the experience, are annoying both for the fruition of the game in and of itself, and above all because they denote a very ~rose water~ testing phase: in fact, these are easily identifiable bugs, and we cite, by way of example, the fact that the game freezes, in worst tradition of PC games, if you decide to act on the zoom level immediately after saving a game, or the problem that occurs when, in a mission, the newly built ships, which would have the task of leaving in search of new lands to to colonize, they simply refuse di do so and remain blissfully moored in your safe and tranquil little harbour. Finally, the Italian translation is very good and will be of help to those who don't know English. The Settlers is a very well done conversion of a saga that carries with it peculiar characteristics, so linked to conscious programming choices that it is difficult to define them as defects. The totally automatic management of the units and the basic repetitiveness could both attract you as they did with hundreds of thousands of PC players and dismantle any enthusiasm: in the first case, many hours of fun and satisfaction await you, in the second, a bitter disappointment. To lower the vote of this version there are defects such as the horrifying music, the presence of only one slot to save, the lack of any multiplayer ambitions and above all a not even tiny number of bugs and incompleteness, which, far from making everything unplayable, however, they denounce the publisher's unwillingness to take a little more time to complete the product. This thing is common practice on PC where patches rush quickly to resolve the situation, but on consoles it becomes ~slightly~ more irritating. only one location! A few bugs, and a couple big ones too! As soon as Nintendo announced the DS and its features, among the first things that crowds of management and strategy fans thought of was the fact that, finally, their favorite genres had also found a home in the console arena: the interface tactile lent itself better than any joypad to replace the mouse for the classic point and click dynamics, and furthermore previous experiments such as Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and Advance Wars had already shown that such an experience, on a laptop, could be extremely enjoyable. The parent company started the dance almost immediately with the splendid Advance Wars Dual Strike, but unfortunately the various third parties, the Japanese ones as well as the Western ones, heirs of an extraordinary twenty-year legacy on PC, were not equally ready. We had to wait a long time, but finally things are starting to move from this point of view too: Age of Empires, Sim City and Anno 1701 are now joined by another historic saga hitherto relegated to Windows and Mac players, and game lovers portable game are preparing to welcome the brave settlers of Ubisoft among their favorites.", "date": "2007-08-21", "grade": null}
