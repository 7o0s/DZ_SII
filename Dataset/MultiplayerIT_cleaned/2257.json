{"name": "SSX Tricky", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ssx-tricky-5.html", "text": "Regarding the aspect of the paths, it must be said that the Canadian programmers have changed the paths just enough not to infuriate the owners of the prequel too much; in fact, they have added several more shortcuts and some are really difficult to find. For the rest, apart from the extraordinary graphic effects, the real changes are in the morphology of the land, now much steeper. As in the previous title, even now it is possible to unlock better performing characters, tracks and boards by proceeding successfully in the World Circuit, also being able to improve the characteristics of your virtual alter ego since for each race won points are given which can be distributed in the various type bars handling, speed, tricks, etc... a little more difficult is unlocking the various ~onesies~ that snowboarders can wear, which are perfectly useless from the point of view of the performance of the characters themselves, in fact it is necessary to complete all six trick chapters with relative moves, some of which are really impossible to perform, in fact I believe that it is necessary to be a master of the pad to reach certain levels of contortion and mental and manual .... applause to those who will be able to complete all six chapters, I stopped at the fifth and hard. However, the difficulty is not high and, after a massive dose of practice on the field, you get there without too many problems first in every competition. Returning to the evolutions, in this respect the only real change was the addition of the Uber Tricks, spectacular moves that can only be performed when the boost bar is full and the red sphere at the top flashes, with a little voice that exalts you by saying ~ Let's Tricky Tricky. ; it is in fact now that by simply pressing the square button and one or two rear buttons (depending on the character) you can perform these incredible tricks which, to tell the truth, are more scenic than fundamental, given that there is not always the possibility to do them and, at the end of the track, you can get there just the same, even with simple jumps which, if well executed, raise the adrenaline bar quite a bit. Moving on to the graphic aspect, the real moles of this title emerge. Don't worry, they are neither many nor too serious, just that after a year and all of EA's experience behind me, I never expected the frame rate to drop below the minimum threshold enough to slow down the game! Oh yes, in cases of excessive crowding (read 3-6 characters on the screen at the same time) everything clicks and without being too annoying to a demanding player it could be annoying. Another aspect that I cannot understand is the use (or rather non-use?) of antialiasing. But is it possible that still, albeit to a lesser extent, there must be ladders on some textures?? But then GT3 was a joke? In that game everything was perfect and I don't think that today the programmers are still unable to exploit the emotion engine properly .... mah. To be honest, it must be said that the game is a real riot of colors and a feast for the eyes, with well-constructed and very vast tracks and moments in which solo and at maximum speed you touch 60fps. I just add that I would have liked a few more frames in the dynamics of the characters, moreover fairly characterized and varied. As for the sound aspect, dynamic DTS encoding makes its debut in a video game. This is a big step forward for all owners of a 5.1 system, as it will finally be possible to play in multi-channel and not just ~hear~ the movies. Of course, the yield is not excellent, in fact, strangely, the central channel is not used and the wrapping effect could be improved, but hearing the noises around it creates its charm and only enhances the excellent impressions that the game gives. The two-player option is fun enough even if it is a pity to be able to play only with the vertical split without being able to also choose the horizontal one which would have given a greater field of vision, but that's okay anyway. I conclude by mentioning the possibility of being able to choose from the initial menu to explore the DVD and access various features such as previews, images of tricks, tracks, videos of real professionals who inspired the programmers and so on. Ultimately we are facing a masterpiece that should not be missing in any self-respecting video game collection, so much is the fun that this title offers, the only note concerns the fact that it is really very similar to the first SSX and who already owns it he will hardly spend 120 cards, oops, around 60 euros to buy this product; a councilme though, sell the old game and buy this one, you won't regret it. Pros: Very funny Excellent graphics DTS encoding Cons: Occasional slowdowns Too much the same as the first SSX A year later EA Sports is reproducing the sequel to the first real killer application that the Ps2 knew, at the time SSX. Remake but not really, this SSX Tricky is nothing more than the first chapter of the series embellished and pumped up. And here it will be said, is this a problem? Absolutely not.but let's go in order. Those who already know the previous title already know what we are talking about, for the remaining group of people who had lived in caves until yesterday or who had recently approached the world of video games, we are faced with the reference point for any game of snowboarding, to the most exhilarating and addictive snowgame ever created; one could almost make a small proportion ie SSX is to Snowboarding what Tony Hawk is to Skateboarding, don't you think? A myth! Moving on to the description of the title, we must first of all say that most of the tracks, the characters, as well as the tricks have remained unchanged from SSX, with obvious improvements and additions, of course. For example, now the tracks have become eight main plus two secrets, but six are the same as the original. The first track we can take is the unedited ~Garibaldi~ which turns out to be very easy and relatively short, compared to the frightening length of the others; in fact, think that for some descents, such as Mesablanca, it takes even five actual minutes of the race, also taking into account the route followed and one's own conduct of the race, obviously.", "date": "2002-01-31", "grade": null}
