Although only at the dawn of the new millennium, with Halo: Combat Evolved, full dignity was given to FPS on consoles, 1997 was undoubtedly a very important year in the slow process of customs clearance from the PC, given that two great works were released on Nintendo 64 etched in the memory of fans: GoldenEye 007 by Rare and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter signed by Acclaim Entertainment. The latter sold about 1.5 million copies and prompted many players to grab the handsome Japanese machine, thanks to the fascinating prehistoric setting (drawn by Jurassic Park) and a very solid technical-playful system, despite some historical defects that have entered the annals exactly like its interesting qualities. Almost twenty years after its debut, the title developed by the talented Iguana Entertainment returns to PC with a re-edition edited by Night Dive Studios, although we are not before the classic update with the ~sequins~ to which this new videogame generation is accustoming us. The dinosaur hunter Turok continues to travel through time, but something has stopped in the 90s Nostalgia take me away Net of some interesting improvements which we will mention later, as can be seen from the images accompanying the article, the technical sector has remained practically unchanged compared to the original work, a symptom that the restoration intervention was decidedly subtle. Before going into the analysis of the new features introduced, let's do a quick overview of the playful properties of the title, which, even with a couple of decades behind it, still manages to achieve its main purpose, which is to entertain. Based on a comic published back in 1954, Turok tells the story of a Native American (called Tal'Set) capable of traveling through time, an extraordinary power which, handed down from generation to generation to the firstborn males of the tribe, is necessary to protect the barrier that divides the Earth from the so-called Lost Land, a world where prehistory and future coexist seamlessly. In the video game, the plot revolves around a very powerful weapon called Chronoscepter, which thousands of years ago was torn apart to prevent it from falling into the hands of bad guys. The bad guy of the moment, a sorcerer, wants to rebuild the ancient artifact by recovering its fragments, but on his way he finds our beefy hero who will try to anticipate it. In addition to collecting the aforementioned pieces, Turok must also take possession of some seals capable of unlocking the access portals to the eight large levels that make up the adventure, in which you will have to return several times from the central Hub (a sort of Stonehenge) to find all the useful objects. The level design is rather peculiar for an FPS and is characterized by numerous (and sometimes frustrating) platform sections, where it is essential to calibrate the jumps to the millimeter in order not to fall into the abyss. There is no shortage of hidden areas that are difficult to identify in which, in addition to the aforementioned items, it is possible to recover weapons, health, emblems (every hundred earns a life) and very useful gadgets such as the backpack, which expands the number of transportable ammunition. From a conceptual point of view we are dealing with an old-school shooter, in which energy does not recharge automatically and to heal oneself it is necessary to recover the health points scattered on the map, also dispensed by (peaceful) fauna and more rarely by killed enemies. Among the most interesting features is the varied arsenal made up of fourteen weapons ranging from the iconic bow - which can be upgraded with teak arrows - up to futuristic and alien instruments of death, such as the Quad Rocket Launcher or the Atomic Fusion Cannon, passing through more traditional fireboxes. While the impact of individual weapons was stunning at the time, their appeal is now tempered by the sketchy feedback and crude animations of enemies. The difficulty level is significantly higher than the current average and some passages will make you sweat the fateful seven shirts to be overcome, not to mention the presence of difficult bosses who are also capable of ~cheating~ in order to put the player on the ropes. Impenetrable fog Among the historical defects of the original work there was certainly the aiming system, which was a little awkward with the Nintendo 64 joypad but also in the PC conversion released at the end of 1997. Night Dive Studios has recalibrated it making it more similar to modern solutions although the classic on-screen viewfinder and a pinch of casua are missingity is always present, influenced by a not exactly flawless hitbox. In addition to the so-called gunplay, the inertia of Turok's movements has been retouched, and now the platform sections are decidedly less tiring and frustrating than in the past. These two elements are further facilitated by the 60 frames per second and by the widening of the visual horizon, which on the Nintendo console was limited by the infamous and characteristic impenetrable fog. Although you now have a better overview and find the hidden paths easier, the rudimentary AI of the enemies more forcefully reveals its limitations, as some of them still behave as if they were hidden by the fog of which above. Night Dive Studios has also intervened slightly on the level design, but the various stages present, mainly set in jungles, rocky areas and primitive ruined cities, are practically similar to the originals. From a cosmetic point of view, support for widescreen and high resolutions has been introduced, plus a whole series of small interventions to the post-processing effects designed to embellish the image; among them we find dynamic lighting, bloom, the FXAA filter, new reflections of the water to make it more believable and more. Despite the updating work, the aesthetic sector is still very dated, poor in details and above all badly aged, due to rough and bare polygonal models, coarse animations and above all very washed-out textures, which with high resolution often highlight the poverty of the palette color originally used. Although it is possible to run the title on a boundless range of hardware configurations, it should be emphasized that the optimization work was not painstaking as one would expect, and in some very rare cases microstuttering is felt even with our high-end test configuration . These are very diluted and almost imperceptible phenomena, but they really have no reason to exist. Those who loved the original Turok on Nintendo 64 will also find the legendary drumming soundtrack and the iconic sound effects, which at the time were subjected to forced quality cutting to get the game into the cartridge.", "date": "2015-12-29", "grade": "7.0"}
