{"name": "No More Heroes 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/no-more-heroes-3-recensione.html", "text": "If it is legitimate to speak in some way of a sort of ~Sudaverse~, a shared narrative universe created by Goichi Suda, it can certainly be said that the professional hitman Travis Touchdown represents its central figure, being the character who most often appears in the works of the visionary Japanese game designer. Works not always supported by important investments, and in which the good Suda51 had to make a virtue of necessity, transforming technical debacles and structural limitations into something as similar as possible to a personal style, a signature that in a world ideal should make us turn a blind eye, sometimes both, to the crude approximation of certain solutions. Here, in the review of No More Heroes 3 we will inevitably talk about this concept, of how the game presents itself right from the start as the bizarre mix of two opposing souls: on the one hand the more playful element of the fights and the crazy narration of a author with counter flakes; on the other, a side dish made of scenarios that are an eyesore, practically sketchy, to be explored on foot or aboard the Schpeltiger motorbike in a flourishing of pop-ups, gigantic pixels, frame rate drops, invisible walls and a degree of close to zero interaction. Story: What if E.T. become bad? No More Heroes 3, Travis in the company of his male-voiced cat, Jeane The story of No More Heroes 3 opens in an unexpected and original way, with a sort of flashback that immediately recalls the arcade imagery of the late 80s, creating a link between a mysterious coin-op in which the main character does not that dying and the subsequent events, which more or less faithfully follow the plot of the film E.T. The extra-terrestrial. In fact, we witness the vicissitudes of a boy, Damon Riccitiello, who finds a small alien, a certain Jess Baptiste VI, for his FU friends, and helps him return to his planet. The two become best friends, so much so that the funny creature gives Damon a special ability before leaving. It is probably thanks to this power that, growing up, the boy manages to create a real technological empire, becoming one of the most powerful men in the world. There's only one problem: when the sweet little FU returns to Earth several years later, he has totally changed not only in appearance but also in disposition, which has become that of a mad exterminator of entire civilizations. After devastating numerous planets, the alien also wants to subdue ours with the help of a team of nine ruthless galactic fighters. Guess who will have to try to stop him? The sequences that mark the arrival of FU in the skies of Santa Destroy are dramatic: Travis and his friends immediately launch the attack, but are routed by the devastating power of the alien prince, who like any Cell , at the suggestion of the inevitable Sylvia Christel and the United Assassins Association, decides to create a sort of tournament to determine who is the strongest assassin in the universe. Structure: a little open and very ugly world No More Heroes 3, Travis on his motorcycle through the deserted streets of Santa Destroy Once the adrenaline for the first sequences of No More Heroes 3 has run out, the structure of the game is described with ruthless simplicity: under the command of Travis, our task is to visit five different scenarios, plus the location of the final battle, in search of so-called ~designated fights~, i.e. increasingly complex fights that will allow us to challenge the ten extraterrestrial warriors in as many boss fights. Each fight yields credits that can be used first of all to buy the tickets necessary to access the challenge with one of the subordinates of FU, secondly to go to the sushi kiosk and get some delicacies to eat in battle to recover energy. With each victory you also get experience points to spend, back at headquarters, to increase the protagonist's health, stamina and attack capacity, speed up the recharge of the four special moves and unlock new ones. No More Heroes 3, one of the extra activities is to unclog public toilets We are therefore limited to this type of routine, going around on foot or by motorbike to reach places of interest from time to time, successfully complete the clashes and move on to the next objective. There is also no shortage of side activities, such as minigames in which you have to unclog toilets (again the devices responsible for saving the game), collect garbage, cut the grass, complete frantic chases or shoot huge crocodiles with a cannon. is that everyone expected an evosolution of that open world sketched in the first two episodes of No More Heroes, finding himself instead facing one of the most sadly desolate, approximate and problematic settings that have been seen in a video game for several years now. Inside the Thunder Dome there is a visually nice section and the open space in front of the hotel where Travis lives bodes well, but just take a walk to realize that this whole part of the experience has been pulled away with a superficiality incredible. No More Heroes 3, one of the game scenarios Moreover, insult is added to the damage, because not only is the city of No More Heroes 3 completely deserted (except for the presence of very few identical passers-by and dressed in an improbable way), devoid of any interaction, with an absurd amount of walls invisible and extremely simple polygonal constructions, but it is not even managed in a dignified way by the Nintendo Switch hardware, which in fact produces numerous drops in frame rate, very evident pop-up effects and an often and willingly flawed texture filter. This realization is so highly approximate of the scenarios really leaves a bad taste in the mouth, because it is evidently the daughter of a limited budget, probably used in its entirety for the realization of the cutscenes and the fights in general, leaving literally a few coins to put together the rest, with the result to obtain exploration sections that still seem to be stuck in the prototype stage. Gameplay: welcome back to the garden of madness No More Heroes 3, Travis in a fight After talking about what just doesn't work in No More Heroes 3, let's move on to the second soul of the title directed by Goichi Suda, the one made in a much better way. After all, it is no mystery that the combat system of the series knows how to dispense thickness, solidity and even a pinch of strategy when the going gets tough, as we have seen in Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes. In this case the action is shot much closer, but the similarities remain several, starting with the four powers that the protagonist can use during battles and which are subject to cooldowns: a devastating double flying kick, a telekinetic projection, a field of projectiles that hit the enemies inside it and finally the ability to slow down time in a limited area, so as to block opponents and make them vulnerable for a few moments. No More Heroes 3, a space battle in which Travis uses his high-tech armor The basic maneuvers are delegated to the main buttons of the controller, with the traditional alternation of fast or slow blows with the energy sword (to be recharged by ~waving it~), jumping and dodging, the latter capable of creating a bullet time when performed with perfect timing. It is possible to lock onto targets with the back buttons and, once the relative bar is filled, to call up a high-tech armor that allows Travis to launch missiles or powerful laser beams, and which in some situations is used in real and own fights in space. Although in portable mode the game gives some less frame rate problems during the aforementioned exploratory phases, the best way to try No More Heroes 3 is by connecting the Nintendo Switch to the TV and holding the Joy-Con separately, so as to be able to use the motion detection system when necessary to perform powerful finishers and spectacular wrestling moves: doing it with the right analog stick does not return the same satisfaction, for sure. Enemies and friends No More Heroes 3, one of the funniest moments Given the paucity of the No More Heroes 3 map and its activities, in the end the game in its essence is nothing more than a boss rush with some distractions which, in hindsight, would probably have been the case to eliminate, remaining focused only on what this project has been able to make the most of: the enemies but also the friends of Travis Touchdown and all the accompanying narration. During the campaign, which lasts about twelve hours where you leave behind several secondary activities, you will learn to learn more about the madness of Jess Baptiste VI, who on more than one occasion ends up thinning the list of his allies, perhaps in the throes of a fit of rage; but also the frustration and motivations of his childhood ~friend~, Damon Riccitiello, forced to indulge in the alien prince's delusions of conquest. No More Heroes 3, one of the most alternative and crazy boss fights Likewise, you will witness this crazy parade of extraterrestrial fighters: some of themyou will face in the traditional way, others according to bizarre rules and breaking the fourth wall as usual, still others... well, we don't want to spoil the surprise, because it is precisely in these situations that Suda51's management best expresses its ideas, by starting quotes that you don't expect and that put a big smile on your face. However, there are not only the bosses: even the standard enemies offer a good variety, they are visually a bit anonymous but boast different patterns and, especially in numerical superiority , manage to give a lot of trouble, even taking us to game over where some impromptu top-up is not used. Here, perhaps limiting this possibility a little more would have made it possible to make the challenge even more consistent, although at the normal difficulty level the game seemed well balanced to us. Technical realization: between high and very low No More Heroes 3, Travis incredulous in the face of the creation of the open scenarios We have already mentioned the graphics of No More Heroes 3, which hand in hand with the structure help to create two distinct and separate worlds: on the one hand the tremendous scenarios that can be explored by the protagonist on foot or by motorbike, which despite their simplicity are subject to frame rate drops, pop-up effects and include a huge amount of invisible barriers. On the other hand, the excellent interlude sequences and the combat sections, the latter capable of maintaining 60 fps and therefore guaranteeing the precision necessary to score hits and dodges. The opening theme songs should also be framed in the most successful part of the production and closing that accompany each ~episode~ of the game, but already at this juncture the protagonist begins to be the sound sector, always very accurate in Suda51's works. In fact, we have an excellent soundtrack and an almost perfect English dubbing with respect to the tone and atmosphere of the story being told.", "date": "2021-08-27", "grade": "7.0"}
