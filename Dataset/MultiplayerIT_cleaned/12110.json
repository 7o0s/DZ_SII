{"name": "Bikini Volleyball", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bikini-volleyball.html", "text": "Evidently not finding particular interest in representing male volleyball players, the transalpine software house has decided to choose 8 particularly busty and attractive girls for the role of protagonists of this Bikini Volleyball. On the other hand, even the eye wants its part... and so thanks to your precious mobile phone, you can embark on exciting challenges to the last two-on-two dunk on the coasts of locations such as Miami, Phuket and Dubai. The main mode is obviously the World Tour, which also allows you to create your own player by editing some simple aspects, such as the cut and color of the hair and the costume worn. Once you take the field, it becomes immediately evident how the programmers wanted to pack something more than a simplistic title to play under the umbrella. While adopting a truly minimal control system, which is entirely enclosed around a single key used to perform all the actions (as well as obviously those related to movements), the games turn out to be much more demanding than one might expect from a title such. In fact, the good artificial intelligence of teammates and opponents leaves little room for easy points, and indeed most of the actions go through an elaborate plot of passes, lifts, dunks and blocks. As a result, the satisfaction linked to a won match increases exponentially, but the time needed to complete a challenge also lengthens, to the best of 3 sets. Furthermore, by carrying out winning actions, it is possible to load a special bar with which to perform highly effective special shots. Unfortunately, the now well-known limit linked to the interface of mobile phones, and therefore to control via the keyboard, often makes it difficult to move the protagonists quickly enough, and it is decidedly frustrating to witness a defeat caused not by one's shortcomings. Furthermore, Bikini Volleyball suffers from a rather incomplete optimization as regards the integration of sound; tested on two different Nokia terminals, N70 and 6290, the Gameloft title presented the annoying habit of freezing for a fraction of a second whenever a sound effect was loaded, making the action much less fluid and appreciable. Removing the audio accompaniment solves the problem almost completely, but we don't think it's right to go down this road to be able to enjoy an ideal gaming experience. A pity because Bikini Volleyball, despite not being the most aesthetically beautiful title available on mobile phones, can still count on more than pleasant graphics especially as regards the animations of the athletes. Finally, it should be noted again, in a Gameloft title, the total absence of any multiplayer mode; frankly it would be time for the French house to start filling this gap which is becoming more and more anachronistic every day.
