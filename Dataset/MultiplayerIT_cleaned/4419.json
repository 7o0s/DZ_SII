Bring you Home takes advantage of the touch screen in a more radical way, presenting a puzzle mechanic that could not ignore its location in digital format, requiring you to act on the screen not so much to move a character or a cursor, but to change what is displayed on the screen same. It's not a completely original solution, having already been tested - albeit in different forms - by the famous Framed and the recent Old Man's Journey, but the particular characterization and care it brings to the design and animations of this game make it really a little pearl of portable entertainment. The story sees the bizarre Polo launched in a desperate search for his ~little dog~ kidnapped by mysterious aliens, which pushes him to rush headlong into various dimensional portals that transport him between disparate and somewhat crazy settings and situations. These dimensions are in fact the micro-levels that we find ourselves facing, all concentrated in single and fixed screens but with a fundamental peculiarity: the characteristics of the setting and of the characters contained within it can be modified by selecting some pre-established options, changing the composition and also the arrangement of the interchangeable panels in order to modify the layout of the scenario and the sequence of events. A strange journey Polo isn't controlled directly, he just moves from the left side to the right side of the level (usually), trying to reach the portal that leads him to the next level. Each screen contains obstacles to be overcome through the interchangeable ~tile~ mechanism. In fact, the screen is divided into various vertical sections that can be changed, with different elements and arrangements, as well as reversed as an order, or by making sure that the protagonist first goes through one and then the other. All this involves a large amount of different combinations for the situations that occur on the screen, and the beauty is that each one generates different but equally funny and particularly well-finished results from a graphic point of view, so that even simply failing we always see pleasant animations . The idea is very nice and the extreme variety of settings and situations in which it is possible to find oneself pushes one to move forward, but the structure of the puzzles is sometimes a little weakened precisely by the large amount of variables present and by the general tone always tending to the absurd. Although this is an indispensable element to characterize the game world in a peculiar way and also make it particularly enjoyable, it is sometimes difficult to correctly deduce the cause-effect concatenation of certain choices and therefore to foresee the correct solution, leading us rather to grope until hit the right combination. If nothing else, the pleasantness of what happens on the screen, however, hardly makes the whole procedure frustrating. Bring you Home is distributed as a standard Premium title at a cost of 3.49 euros and without in-app purchases (at least for the moment).", "date": "2018-02-09", "grade": "7.8"}
