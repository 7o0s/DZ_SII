Often, unfortunately, in an inaccurate way and with an unwillingness to really face the discussion, also due to a lack of culture in those who find themselves animating the debate. And yet something is moving, because the video game is not just pure fun, and Nintendo for example is a master in this, but it has enormous facets capable of involving and thrilling a vast group of people, leaving its mark in terms of narration, music, graphics and everything that goes with it. If to all these assumptions we add the iron law according to which developers give their best especially when the consoles are approaching the end of their life cycle, as we will see in the review of The Last of Us the latest work by Naughty Dog rewrites in starts the classic paradigms of the adventure genre and suddenly becomes an essential title for PlayStation 3 owners, and not just for them. Applied cinema Think of a season of your favorite TV series, where the main protagonists experience a series of vicissitudes in the most disparate settings, and over time they meet a series of secondary characters with whom they share a few moments and then see them die. run away or go your own way. They feel emotions, play double-crosses, have a strong character or surrender to the fate that has corrupted the world around them. In The Last of Us a mysterious fungus has created an incurable pandemic, which over the years has left cities in a state of abandonment and decay; to draw a parallel, a mix between I Am Legend and The Walking Dead. You are Joel and, after the initial fully playable prologue, you will find yourself twenty years later smuggling weapons, surviving and keeping account of mercenaries and small groups who, perhaps rightly, think of nothing but their own profit. Among these, the Luci stand out (in English Firefly, fireflies, a name obviously modified to avoid the inevitable sexual jokes that our readers like so much), a paramilitary organization in constant search of a cure, at any cost. Joel will then meet Ellie, a fourteen-year-old girl with whom he establishes an increasingly intense and paternal relationship, in an incredible series of vicissitudes. It doesn't matter where it is set or in what period, but it is interesting to discover that the story of The Last of Us will unfold over the course of a year through a repeated series of twists and a different narrative than usual, uncommon for a production video game. In fact, in this third-person adventure we see all the experience gained by Naughty Dog with Uncharted: the interlude sequences blend perfectly with those of the game, the dialogue between the protagonists is constant and credible, the camera is always positioned in place right and the absence of any information on the screen for most of the time increases that sense of identification and involvement that is perceived in all phases of the adventure. The Last of Us therefore has the ambitions of an interactive film, but with a different key to interpretation than what Quantic Dream did with Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. In this title, in fact, the intention is not to recreate reality en masse, allowing for example to simulate behaviors such as watching television or interacting with all the elements of the scenario, but rather to apply a spectacular, credible and integrated narrative layer to the classic gameplay of a video game without any compromises. The title therefore takes place between exploration and moments of relative tranquility, interesting dialogues between the characters, breathtaking landscapes and opponents who must be faced openly, avoiding or killing them without making any noise. The puzzle and platform sections that require skill are reduced to a minimum, the runners and the clickers, two species of people mutated by the mushroom, only only a not even majority part of the dangers that Joel and Ellie will face on their way. Live or die The impact with the control system is not very different from Uncharted and other third-person action adventures: the view is behind you, slightly shifted; the right analog moves the camera; the upper lats are for aiming and shooting; square is pressed for melee attack, triangle to activate gears and pick up items. The animation system, largely revised, and the design choices, which among other things provide for the absence of the jump, return a feeling, however,quite different than usual. The Last of Us is a survival game: ammunition is limited and Joel must collect resources directly on the field to create medical kits, Molotov cocktails, knives and more. Once you have recovered material such as alcohol, scissors or bandages, just press the select button and dedicate yourself to the creation which takes place in real time and takes a few seconds, leaving the protagonists uncovered with the risk of being attacked. Weapons such as pistols, revolvers, shotguns, shotguns, a bow and more are collected on the playing field, without going exotic with bazookas or end-of-the-world weapons. Joel can also collect a vast collection of maces and blunt weapons, because the title strongly wants to demonstrate that it is set in a violent, adult and raw world, and this is also reflected in the fights. The Last of Us is in fact extremely violent, but never free; Joel is an egoist who often finds himself making difficult choices, he sees people commit suicide, he kills in cold blood even just for having sensed a danger. The hand-to-hand fights - but also those in fire - have a strong and satisfying physicality, a decisive step forward compared to Uncharted. There are heads bouncing and melee attacks; the recoil of the weapons is as strong as the noise they emit: the new Naughty Dog title satisfies and involves for this too, thanks to an always high tension. In reality, almost all the clashes can be tackled following different strategies, and above all at the higher difficulty levels there is a need for a little salt in the pumpkin because the resources are limited and the enemies are rather tough. Clickers, for example, can't see but are sensitive to any noise, even when crouched, and it only takes one hit to kill you if you're bare-handed, so you have to distract them with a brick or glass bottle or kill them stealthily , but only if you are in possession of a knife, as it is not possible to strangle them. Runners attack in groups and you need to be well equipped not to be overwhelmed; for humans there are several solutions up to the open confrontation, taking advantage of the shelters. Precisely with regard to this aspect, Naughty Dog has elegantly solved the classic problem that afflicts the games that use them, namely having to hook or unhook automatically, or by pressing a special key, giving rise to an unnatural click and perhaps generating a little ' of confusion in the most excited moments. In the case of The Last of Us, the circle key is used to crouch and make less noise; when approaching cover you are already low enough not to be seen and Joel rests his hands on the wall in a natural way, moving away if you want in a perfectly fluid way or leaning out when aiming to shoot. How does it all work? Well, to say the least: the ~stealth~ and combat sections are very satisfying, the variety is no less so and the alternation between exploration and narration allows you to avoid repetitive moments, leaving the player the full taste of choosing the best strategy and, not infrequently, to die when he gets carried away by the heat. It is no country for fools The Last of Us is not an easy game and offers an excellent level of challenge; the developers have managed to convey that sense of impotence and tension that characterizes the surrounding world, with a few jerks in the chair but guaranteeing genuine amazement in participating or witnessing what is happening on the screen. Only the artificial intelligence behaves in a ~strange~ way and represents the least refined element of the production. We said at the beginning that the main protagonists often meet some supporting actors who accompany them for a piece of the adventure, and therefore in different sections we go on in three or four people. In these situations, the artificial intelligence seems to ignore the movements of its companions: for example, Joel moves in an absolutely silent way so as not to be discovered while the supporting characters make sounds, run from one cover to another or enter the line of sight of the enemies. .. who ignore them beautifully. In fact, all the stealth management seems to be concentrated only on the main protagonist, and if most of the time it doesn't bother you because maybe the supporting actors stay quiet behind you and engage in battle only when you are discovered, in at least a couple of Occasions we have turned up our noses at such unrealistic behaviour. On the other hand, the patrols of the opponents that really cover the entire game map, and their continuous movement when there is a firefight are much more satisfying. Maybe they could have been smarter in the presence of a corpse, but it's not donetoo much case. The defects of artificial intelligence fortunately go into the background thanks to the rest of the game, which reaches peaks of excellence from any direction you look at it: story, narrative and gameplay come together beautifully and go hand in hand with the level of challenge proposed. Of the three difficulty levels initially available, only the Easy one allows aim assist; in the Survivor one, which is unlocked after finishing the game for the first time, it is not even possible to enable the Listening mode which allows you to identify the closest opponents (by pressing the right backbone) thanks to the sound of their footsteps, nor use the supplements which allow you to improve Joel's skills (for example the reduction of the recoil of weapons or the use of the knife automatically following the attack of the clickers). For all difficulty levels, however, it is possible to collect materials to be used at special workbenches to improve weapons; in the case of the revolver, for example, it will be possible to increase the magazine or firepower, or we will be able to reduce the reload speed of the hunting rifle or add a scope. Last but not least, the amount of collectibles is quite full-bodied, including artifacts of the survivors who tell their story, comics for Ellie, dog tags of the Lights that fell in battle, training manuals to improve the creation of objects. The possibility of tackling a difficulty level also in Plus mode also allows you to continue ~fishing~ with the objects already acquired and the energy pills collected. During our test we completed The Last of Us in 15 hours and 36 minutes on Normal level, collecting just over half of the artifacts with 66 deaths and 40% of the kills in close combat. We also played several hours in Hard and Survivor modes, to ascertain how that concept of survival mentioned several times in this article is further amplified. The multiplayer Announced just a few months ago, The Last of Us' multiplayer was developed by a separate team at Naughty Dog, and while it's not the big winner or part of our vote, it does have some interesting points worth mentioning. explored after the release of the game. The maps available are seven and taken from the single mode. The first thing to do is choose one of the two available factions, Hunters and Lights, to which you remain bound for twelve weeks of survival, with each game representing one day. The aim is to increase the population of one's faction by winning, accumulating resources and obtaining survivors in exchange for a maximum of forty, which are then the necessary condition to obtain, for example, access to the most advanced aesthetic customizations beyond the basic ones for helmet, uniform, pants and emblem. Once the faction has been chosen, two modes are accessed, Supply Hunt and Survivors. The first is played four against four with twenty lives per team within a time limit of fifteen minutes. You have to collect ingredients on the field to create items and when you kill enemies you get materials that can be spent on the fly to buy weapons or ammunition, or kept in case of victory to increase supplies for your faction and increase the population. In Survivor mode, each round provides only one life and resources are depleted at the end of the match. In general, the pace of the game is rather staid and pleasant, you often have to hide or use cover, move constantly between the large maps in a game system that is somewhat reminiscent of Uncharted, only with much more physicality in hand-to-hand combat distance and close. There is no shortage of classic perks to unlock and points to assign for skills and weapons, with four predefined configurations that can be selected as a sniper or stormtrooper. Also in this case it is important to accumulate supplies for your faction in order to access more advanced skills that increase the physical and weapon characteristics of your characters. Playstation 3 trophies The Last of Us offers 26 trophies, of which 6 are gold and 9 are silver. A rather small number therefore, ~aggravated~ by the fact that we have only unlocked four after completing the game on a normal level; this is because there are eight trophies linked to the difficulty levels, equally divided between each of them and the related Plus mode. The platinum hunters will therefore have to complete the game at least three times and play in multiplayer, where the four special trophies are obtained by participating to an onl match", "date": "2013-06-05", "grade": "9.7"}
