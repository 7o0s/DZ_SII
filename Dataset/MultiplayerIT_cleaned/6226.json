Our alter ego is a mysterious hero of few words and many deeds, who wears a motorcycle suit and helmet and goes around armed with a katana, in full Kill Bill style. From Tarantino's film Ronin also recovers the desire for revenge, given that our goal will be to eliminate a series of targets one after the other, making our way through dozens of bodyguards. Just like the ronin of feudal Japan, we will serve no master and have no one to rely on, only our steel, our athleticism and some special abilities that we will unlock during the course of the missions. Acrobatics, katanas and revenge are the main elements of Ronin, an interesting indie on Steam In the guise of an assassin Taking on the role of a deadly assassin is one of the great classics of the world of video games and in Ronin it is also a very fun experience. Climbing a building secretly, moving along the roofs, dodging traps, avoiding any possible light source and swinging silently along the rope of a grappling hook, to then discreetly eliminate our target with a well-executed sword stroke... who Wouldn't you like to live like this? Well out of the world of video games in many, but inside Ronin this will be our routine. As taught by his spiritual father, Gunpoint, discretion and the exploitation of the surprise effect are essential for the success of a mission: we are not dealing with a purely stealth game, but hitting first is undoubtedly preferable. In fact, however lethal our shots may be and our jumps precise, one bullet will be enough to put an end to our thirst for revenge. It is therefore imperative to kill fast and strike first try to always stay out of the sights of the guards. Normally the game is controlled more or less like a platformer, using the mouse to decide where to jump, but during the fight the action automatically becomes turn-based, so as to allow us to move in space planning our next move very carefully. Each enemy is equipped with a laser sight that will point at us in the turn before the one in which he fires, so you will never, ever have to face those small red lines if you don't want to start the checkpoint all over again. Fortunately the game, despite having a fairly high average level of difficulty, in case of death will not make us repeat the entire level from scratch, but only the last fight. Hopping on the massacre The only way to survive during the clashes is to jump and to do this you have to press the left mouse button at the exact point where we want to land, while the interface will show us the trajectory of our movement. If we jump over an enemy we will stun him for two seconds, which will allow us to deliver the coup de grace, unless there are other guards present. Each turn advances the action by one second, which is very important in case someone is about to raise an alarm; in fact, if we are spotted, we will have 8 seconds to kill whoever discovered us and prevent the situation from becoming much more difficult. Every time we kill a guard we will accumulate action points that will allow us to use the skills that we have unlocked using our experience, but if we keep the points we will be able to reach a ~limit break~, or use two consecutive moves in the same turn. Unlocking the additional skills is essential to have an easy life in the advanced levels and to get the necessary experience points we will have to complete all the secondary objectives of the level, which are usually three: do not kill civilians, eliminate all enemies, never trigger the 'alarm. By doing so we will be able to stun multiple enemies simultaneously with shurikens, throw our katana to strike from a distance, silently hang enemies from the ceiling with ropes or leave holograms capable of distracting enemies. Control is everything... sadly Unfortunately, for a game that requires calmness and precision, Ronin doesn't have very precise controls. It may happen that the jump arc is not exactly as shown by the interface, or that our assassin is a pixel too close to the line of fire and is killed for no reason, or that suddenly the key to enter a door becomes the one for kill an unsuspecting civilian. It may also happen that suddenly the game decides that we can't do that type of jump, and allows us to land anywhere, butto not where we want. Luckily there are quite a few checkpoints, so even the biggest mistakes don't affect progress too much. Another possible flaw concerns the level of difficulty. Initially the game is very simple, just to give you time to get used to the controls. However, when the situation starts to get complicated it becomes seriously so, only to present us with levels that can be concluded very easily. We then go from damn frustrating and perhaps all too difficult moments to clashes in which the worst is always expected and instead everything ends in a few simple moves. In general, however, the challenge offered by Ronin is always of a good standard and even if it can be finished in about six, seven hours, it will be hours of curses, reflections and subtle satisfactions. Too bad that it is often very, very difficult to complete the objectives that will allow us to obtain experience points, so it is said that in the end we can take advantage of all the tricks at our disposal and which can offer very creative solutions.", "date": "2015-07-06", "grade": "7.8"}
