{"name": "Heroes of the Pacific", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heroes-of-the-pacific.html", "text": "Take off! Codemasters' latest product notably starts out as an arcade shooter, leaving the player with the choice of a ~simplified~ or ~realistic~ control system. Obviously this does not transform Heroes of the Pacific into a real flight simulator, but it significantly influences the approach to fights immediately after the short tutorial that introduces you to flight techniques and approach techniques. In Campaign mode, the fulcrum of HOTP, the missions follow one another according to historical events, preceded by accurate briefings whose content, in principle, does not necessarily need to be memorized for everything to be successful. In fact, during the game, the new mission objectives are announced as they appear, and indicated on the screen by arrows and targets that leave little to the imagination. Despite appearances, completing the missions becomes anything but simple starting from the first stages, because you have to quickly learn to combine the effectiveness of our machine guns with the shooting accuracy offered by a vehicle that can be anything but accurate. When our intervention is urgently required, there is really something to do. Completing each mission allows us to unlock new planes and earn credits to upgrade those we already have. Take off! The planes are piloted using the analog sticks (also for take-off practice), with the left acting as ~steering~ and the right acting as accelerator / brake and which allows us to implement evasive maneuvers when we are under fire. An indicator positioned in the upper area of the screen allows us to monitor the state of health of the aircraft and the ability of the engine to resist the ~quick shots~, which can be made by holding down the right stick on its axis and which prove to be essential when very rapid intervention is required. Primary and secondary weapons are activated via the back buttons, of course. Completing each mission allows us to unlock new planes and earn credits to upgrade those we already have. Already halfway through the game you find yourself with a fleet of machines of a certain level, each one however not very different from the other in practical terms. War technique The technical realization of Heroes of the Pacific is quite good, even if it does not fall within the areas of excellence. As mentioned at the beginning, the graphics of the menus and briefings are stylistically perfect, and it is a pleasure to note that even in the actual game it is no different: the planes are reproduced accurately and move on convincing scenarios, albeit rather lacking in details. What is certain is that the creation of the clouds and the ~turbo~ effect are very convincing and often you really feel like you are in the air. Although the sound effects do not boast exceptional quality, the goodness of the musical commentary (although not always present, on the contrary) raises the average of the HOTP acoustic sector, deserving abundant sufficiency. The discourse relating to design, understood as a conception of the game in its structure, is different: the missions soon end up looking too similar, and the playability is not so high as to cover the flaw. In the end we don't continue for the involvement of the battle, but to test the new planes; given the small difference between the various models, however, this element cannot represent a valid contribution to the longevity of the product. Comment Within a genre that is certainly not crowded, Heroes of the Pacific has all it takes to achieve good success. The comparison with the best exponents of the genre is merciless, but the Codemasters game manages to carve out its own space thanks to the new setting (at least for arcade shooters on PS2 and Xbox) and discreet playability. Pros: Good representation of flight Convincing control system Atmospheric commentary Cons: Perhaps the difficulty is not well balanced Environments not very detailed Planes too similar to each other If there was still the word ~presentation~ in the report cards of video game magazines, Heroes of the Pacific would deserve at least an 80%. This is because the graphics of the game, and in this case we refer to the menus and briefings, have been created ~themed~ in the most literal sense of the term. Posters, drawings and writings in full ~forties~ style lead you to navigate through the options and methods available, while an ~epic~ soundtrack projects you into the atmosphere of the conflict. It doesn't matter if the plot of HOTP borrows more than one element from that of the film ~Pearl Harbor~: after a minute you will feel more than motivated to get on the first fighter planement and to take down some enemy soldiers.", "date": "2005-08-05", "grade": null}
