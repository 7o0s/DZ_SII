The first thing we have to do once the game has started is to create our character from scratch, giving him the look we like best. As for its characteristics, we will be able to develop them from game to game, depending on what we combine. And the game modes that will allow us to do this are the quick match, the PGA Tour, a challenge mode and one for multiplayer. Where the quick game allows us to immediately become familiar with the control system, which can be illustrated to us in a rather complete tutorial if desired, it is the PGA Tour that represents the most substantial part of the game, with the development of a real career that traces all the golf tournaments that take place annually. Participating in these competitions and obtaining good results makes our character grow from every point of view, in particular the handicap value we have against the opponents is modified, whose scores at the beginning will seem unattainable to us. The challenge mode is a great way to engage in short but engaging game sessions: the various facets of a golf ball each contain a different contest of skill, the main application of which concerns one of the various aspects of the game. You will be asked to bring the ball closer to the hole with a certain number of shots and within a time limit, or to reach certain areas with a single swing, or to make the ball travel for a certain number of metres. Each challenge completed unlocks others, in a crescendo that can potentially transform you into a good player better than a real game, since you focus on different aspects by tackling them one at a time. Finally, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 includes a rather solid and complete multiplayer mode: it is possible to challenge up to three friends locally (whether they also own the game or not  in which case there are some limitations) or set up games with players around the world using the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, as usual very simple to use and which, in this case, only lacks the possibility of voice chat. The game If the first Tiger Woods PGA Tour didn't make good use of the Nintendo DS touch screen, for a whole series of reasons (primarily the immaturity of the project and the limited time available to the developers to adapt it to the characteristics of the console), the 2008 edition is very complete from this point of view and it is possible to manage everything using the stylus. Once on the game course, on the touch screen we will see our player and a series of information regarding the environmental conditions (wind speed and direction, various distances), as well as an icon that allows us to select the club to use as well as the type shooting. In the upper screen, however, we will see an indicator positioned where the ball should arrive, and which can be moved by changing the club and shooting style. By moving the directional cross you can also visualize the entire path from the hypothetical arrival of the ball to the player, realizing the presence of dangerous areas (large grass, sand, obstacles...) and modifying the launch accordingly. The shot is performed by pressing the stylus on the ball: a line is drawn downwards to determine the ~range~ of the throw, after which the stylus moves upwards more or less quickly depending on the power to be placed in the ball. swing. The inclination of this last movement decides the direction of the shot, with a real impact on the result; and with the ball in the air you can also act on its rotational movement, modifying its behavior upon landing. A carefree approach turns out to be ineffective right away: the game must be faced with patience and with a pinch of strategy, you need to have a good vision of the course and finally shoot accurately. When you get a short distance from the hole, a diagram is shown on the upper screen to give us an idea of the characteristics of the terrain, its inclination and any irregularities. If the ball is only a few centimeters away, however, there's nothing to worry about: our player will put it in automatically, saving us a lot of money... Technical realization On a technical level, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 looks pretty good, albeit with ups and downs. The DS' dual screens scroll polygons at a constant 30fps, and the idea of depth is rendered very well, even if there aren't so many and such elements on the screens to complicate life for developers. More than anything, it's the level of detail that leaves ua little to be desired: the character boasts convincing animations but a poorly defined appearance, as well as most of the textures. Everything is functional to the action, however, and the presence of different views that frame the moving ball is appreciable: they give the throws a certain spectacularity. The sound sector, on the other hand, is decidedly subdued in its essentiality: only a few effects of moderate quality, nothing transcendental. But after all, a soundtrack would have gone out of tune with the spirit of the game... Finally, the control system via touch screen (which, if desired, can be switched to a more conventional combination of directional cross and buttons...) is rather precise and effective, only rarely giving rise to episodes of frustration. Comment Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is a great golf game, probably the best the Nintendo DS has to offer. In this kind of title, you don't suffer particularly when the approach is very prone to realism, and the new EA Sports product is no exception: after a little practice, you begin to be more precise in your shots and understand how everything works. The presence of challenges makes an important contribution to your training, and the presence of excellent multiplayer modes certainly represents an added value, which fleshes out the longevity of a product that otherwise would have had to rely on Career alone. The best part of PGA Tour 08, however, lies in its depth, which leads to a reasoned approach to every shot, resulting in satisfaction when you manage to place the ball where you want. A highly recommended purchase for all golf enthusiasts, therefore. Pros: Precise and intuitive control Different game modes Technically sound Cons: Difficulty level often unforgiving Some glitches in polygon rendering If you don't like golf, it's unlikely you'll like it Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is available for 360, DS, PC, PS2, PS3, PSP and Wii. The version used for this review is the DS version. Electronic Arts sports titles have been a consolidated reality in the video game scene for several years. Sometimes they are developed in a hurry, sometimes they introduce important innovative elements: whatever their nature, they almost always manage to obtain excellent commercial feedback, thanks also to a policy that does not miss any of the important opportunities to offer users a certain product. The EA Sports division is like a model worker: first in and last out. An attitude that also concerns Tiger Woods PGA Tour, released in conjunction with the launch of the Nintendo DS, a few years ago, and now back to prove its true value.", "date": "2007-09-13", "grade": null}
