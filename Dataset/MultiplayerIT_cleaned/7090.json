Among the most famous representatives of the ~second generation~ of games for the 16-bit console, after a first wave consisting almost exclusively of conversions of the Japanese house's coin-ops, the platformer created by Yuji Naka was faster and more colorful than anything had been seen up to that moment. The idea behind the franchise, as you may know, was to give life to a mascot, a character that could be representative of the SEGA world as Mario was for Nintendo. A goal that Naka and his talented collaborators have achieved in full, however delivering to the owners of the Mega Drive a different platform experience than that which characterized the adventures of the mustachioed plumber. Sonic Origins, the protagonist runs in one of the new animated sequences As mentioned, in fact, Sonic the Hedgehog ran fast, very fast in some moments, yet completing the levels in a matter of seconds was only one of the possible approaches to the gameplay, endowed with an unsuspected thickness at first. In fact, the level design of the iconic scenarios lent itself to more detailed and careful explorations, to the discovery of unbreakable or invisible walls, to the collection of rings and Chaos Emeralds through dedicated areas, in short, to the most extreme completionism. A mixture that the subsequent episodes of the series have only further enriched and emphasized, and which we find not only intact but even valued in the context of a remaster that the guys from Headcannon Games have created with competence and passion, although the production aspects of the operation have not been as brilliant . In what sense? We explain it to you in the Sonic Origins review. Contents Sonic Origins, the first boss fight of Sonic the Hedgehog Sonic Origins includes in a single package Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic CD, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the combination of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles (the two games were developed as a single chapter, but production costs forced SEGA to distribute them as separate titles), a Mission mode that allows you to tackle all the adventures in sequence or try your hand at special challenges, and finally a Museum mode where you can admire and unlock images, videos and music. Each episode can be played in Anniversary mode or Classic mode, as well as including a Boss Assault which will see us fight Doctor Robotnik in his various forms but without rings available, therefore with a higher degree of difficulty than normal boss fights . But let's go back to the two main options, which allow you to enjoy respectively the restored version of the games or a sort of imitation of the originals with side bands and without some features. We talked about ~imitation~ not by chance, given that even in the Classic mode the Sonic Origins experience can count on the presence of a resolution adequate to today's standards, refined mechanics as regards the controls (which also work well with the analog stick and not with just the d-pad), the inclusion of the Spin Dash (and of the Drop Dash, curiously) already from the first chapter and a revisited scrolling to reflect the fluidity guaranteed by the 60 frames per second at which the remaster runs. It comes from itself that the best way to approach the collection is to focus on the Anniversary mode, which modifies the original aspect ratio to embrace 16:9, can count on the improvements on the gameplay side we have just mentioned, on perfectly defined graphics even with the its large pixels, on the possibility of selecting the character we want to control at the start (among the various Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, even in pairs) and on the coin system, which serves on the one hand to guarantee a second chance during the demanding special stages for obtaining the Chaos Emeralds, on the other hand to unlock content in the Museum mode. Gameplay: faithful but refined Sonic Origins, a Sonic CD level featuring Tails The best aspect of Sonic Origins is undoubtedly the adaptation of the gameplay, carried out in an extremely respectful way of the original games yet able to refine the controls and interactions just enough to get the feeling of a modern production: free of inertia and slipperiness in order to guarantee the precision of every single jump, but at the same time ready for a new adrenaline rush when tackling speed sequences, between tunnels and loops. This is not a job that anyone could have done: the guys at Headcannon Games knew the epclassic isodes of Sonic the Hedgehog like their own pockets, it is evident, and they therefore knew where to intervene to eliminate some catch and revive the experience, which in this way is capable of involving both nostalgics and those titles after more than thirty years have experienced on Mega Drive, both novices. Sonic Origins, the Classic mode with its 4:3 aspect ratio Naturally the mechanics have been adapted in order to establish a fund of great coherence between all the episodes of the package, which therefore stand out more than anything else for the evolution of the level design, more linear in the debut chapter and more intricate with the exits later, which also and above all focused on verticality (as well as on the profound variations of the special areas) to add a new dimension to the game and find new ideas. The introduction of coins (with their role in unlocking collectibles) and a system of checkpoint-based saving represents from this point of view a necessary intervention to remove some dust from the original system, and the fact that this inevitably makes the completion of the various campaigns easier is an absolutely sensible compromise. Unsympathetic decisions If we have to find fault with Sonic Origins, we could say that the price of the collection appears a bit excessive, considering that the games in question have already been the subject of similar operations and that the only remastering work, although carried out with care and attention does not imply high development costs. However, the thing we really cannot believe is having deliberately excluded some extras from the package (specifically additional missions and modes) that must be purchased separately in the form of DLC, or by opting for the Deluxe Edition. Technical realization: graphics and sound from the past Sonic Origins, one of the lava levels from the first episode We've already talked about it: Sonic Origins graphics are the result of a careful and well-crafted remastering work, a resample of the original assets that enhances the pixel art by adapting it to today's resolution values. Of course, it is also true that on Nintendo Switch, the games in the series are best suited for portability, therefore on a small screen, and playing in docked mode does not give the same sensations. A quick comparison with the originals highlights the substantial differences for as regards the fluidity of the scrolling, which here exploits the 60 fps and also produces improvements in the context of the gameplay, in terms of responsiveness and precision of the controls. Speaking of differences, each act is now introduced by a pleasant and stylish cartoon interlude sequence. Sonic Origins, the opening of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 After that, each episode makes its own story and there are more or less successful ones: for example, we have never appreciated Sonic CD's scenarios that much, in our opinion excessively ~dirty~ and chaotic, but there is no doubt how the enthusiasm around greater memory capacity guaranteed by the peripheral has allowed the developers to really insert a lot of graphic elements and variations on the theme. Finally, the sound sector needs very little introduction: the songs created by Masato Nakamura, the various Hataya, Ogata, Senoue, Maeda and their American colleagues (too bad the tracks of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 that are said to have been composed by Michael Jackson are missing) boast a personality and depth that are still clearly distinguishable today, capable of getting into your head after a few minutes and staying there for a quite a bit.", "date": "2022-06-26", "grade": "8.0"}
