{"name": "Anteprima di Grandia 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/anteprima-di-grandia-2.html", "text": "What a strange JRPG on PC Grandia 2 is a JRPG (Japan Role Play Game) of the most classic, the first incarnation of the title, released for the defunct Sega Saturn console, was considered as one of the best Japanese role-playing games that appeared up to that moment, fighting on equal terms against the excessive power of the Final Fantasy saga, which has reached the probably best successful title of the series: the VII. The second incarnation of the Grandia saga was always released for a Sega console, the Dreamcast, and after witnessing the premature demise of this platform as well, a European producer and distributor, Ubisoft, decides to save the title from oblivion and convert it for PS2 and strangely also for PC. Oddly because PC users do not digest the peculiar setting of JRPGs, perhaps because until now they have known almost exclusively Squaresoft titles, perhaps due to intrinsic and indubitable cultural differences or perhaps because PC users are accustomed to the extremely high quality standards of western role that continually delight them. To be honest Initially Grandia 2 had not really convinced me. The preview code arrived on a sunny Friday afternoon, I quickly unwrapped the case that contained the two CDs like a child on Christmas morning, excited because a new adventure was opening up before me to explore and a little worried about a more prosaic stability of my system after installing a beta. The installation, however, went smoothly, supported by the latest version of InstallShield, the game occupied its beautiful 800Mb of HD by placing a nice inviting icon on my desktop. I started the game and it asked me to set the video and button configuration, an automatic operation the first time you run the game and which can be called up for adjustments from a special menu item. I set the maximum resolution: 1024x768 at 32bit, configured the keyboard and also the joypad, while a very boring flea kept whispering in my ear: ~console ... console ...~ [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] An alien world Launched ~Start Game~ here I am involved in a very long and interesting presentation of the alien world of Grandia2. One of the differences between Western and Japanese role-playing games is that the latter take a lot of things for granted and introduce you to the story abruptly and immediately. Furthermore, the game setting does not recall any historical or fantastic setting recognizable by the player, but totally alien and therefore completely original. At the beginning this displaces a lot since starting the game you have the same feeling that you would have starting to see a film in the middle, the mind is crowded with questions to which answers cannot be found immediately but after several hours of play. In the introduction we get to know the main protagonist: Ryudo. He is a Geo Hound, in other words a hired, cynical and disenchanted mercenary who for money deals with solving many small problems such as killing monsters, escorting defenseless girls and so on. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] An alien world One cannot help but find this character immediately likable, accompanied by the faithful eagle Skye who acts as a talking cricket dispensing wise advice during the course of the adventure. Precisely the immediate sympathy that arises for the character that we will impersonate makes the non-creation of the same bearable for us, since we will not be able to decide to change the character, we will not be involved in the selection of his characteristics, in short, our freedom is immediately lacking. The story of Granas and Valmar The story of Grandia 2 is not very original, even if to be honest it rarely is in an RPG, since it usually sees the forces of good and evil opposed by two of the quarrelsome Granas and Valmar. In the first title Granas, the god of good, had beaten Valmar, the evil god, using a weapon of devastating power, so powerful that it caused a huge and gigantic gash on the earth, virtually dividing it in two. Valmar was defeated and broken into many small fragments that scattered randomly on the earth. Good triumphed by dancing over the remains of the crumbled enemy and the cult of Granas flourished throughout the continent, everyone lived happily ever after etc...[***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] The story of Granas and Valmar But things in Grandia2 are not as they seem, the plot unfolds slowly involving more and more people, from our first job as a bodyguard of a priestess of Granas begins a complex and interesting story that involves with its irony, with dialogues very spot on, with very well thought out twists. But you have to let go. We will always and in any case be passive spectators of the story, we will not decide what to make the characters say, we will not decide the tone of the speech, we will not decide where to go, what to do, when to do it and why to do it. If one feels that this setting will make him feel caged, leave this game alone, if you also don't mind letting go and being transported to a world away from a plot of undoubted quality, then get on board. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] An exploited system? The tested version is of course a preview code and as such not fully tested and optimized, the game should be officially released in March so it is very likely that many of the uncertainties encountered will be resolved at the time of publication. This necessary premise to introduce the discourse of the graphics of Grandia II. The graphic setting is an isometric 3D in perfect Darkstone style, the appearance is pleasant albeit poorly defined and sometimes very pixelated despite the set resolution being 1024x768 at 32 bit. Instead, the battles section is a different matter, completely in 3D with a mobile camera, this section is a triumph of lights and colors, of the movements of the characters and enemies in a dance that often leaves you speechless for its beauty, definition and general rendering . [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] An exploited system? Some have complained about the jerkiness and heaviness of the graphics engine both when moving around the game map and during fights. Honestly I haven't encountered any of these problems, my system is an Athlon 900Mhz, GeForce2 MX 400 and 256Mb of ram. Unfortunately, the problem is another and it is much more serious than some sporadic slowdown: the position of the camera. The game camera is freely rotatable around the central axis made up of the party, but it is not possible to set its height and as it is it is so squashed downwards as to be decidedly annoying. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] An exploited system? Often you don't understand where you are only because you can't have an overview around the party that goes beyond your nose and considering that there is no map during the game you find yourself wandering around like idiots trying to ~see~ the surrounding world. To get an idea, imagine playing Darkstone with the camera pressed down and you'll get an idea. Eastern statistics The party during our adventure will be variable, Ryudo is obviously a constant component, but all the other characters will join, detach and reunite at will. Each character has four main skills that determine their physical characteristics such as strength and speed that can be increased by leveling up or thanks to magical artifacts. Having said that, let's go into the complexity of the magic system and special moves. In addition to the health bar (aka hit points) each character will also have a magic bar (mana points) and a special point bar. The mana points will naturally be used to cast spells that can only be cast if in possession of particular objects called Mana Eggs. If a character wears a Mana Egg then they will have access to that Egg's particular magic, otherwise nothing. The special points, on the other hand, are used to try their hand during combat with each character's own special moves. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Eastern statistics At the end of a fight, in addition to experience and money, we will also accumulate Mana Coins and Special Coins which will be used to activate new spells contained in the Mana Eggs, learn new special moves or improve them by leveling up both skills and spells with new stars. Eastern fights I fightsnts in Grandia 2 are not random, the enemies are clearly visible on the game map and we will be able to decide whether to fight them or not. In fact, approaching them they will turn red, with a jog we will be able to avoid them or focus on them and massacre them. If by will or by bad luck we get involved in a fight, then the combat section opens up. The combat system is simply one of the best ever born in the land of the Rising Sun, engaging and spectacular, it is always welcomed with joy and never with boredom which also arises from other more famous competitors. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Eastern fights The fight begins with an overview of the arena whose background is always themed with the terrain on which you were walking on the game map, once the overview is over, the menu items and the time bar open up. Let's start by saying that the combat is pure turn-based, no more racing between menu items that had particularly bored me in Final Fantasy, a bar appears in the lower right corner indicating the time status of each character and enemy. To perform an action a character needs time, when he is ready here is the time to stop and open the action menu, once an option is selected the time will continue to flow until the character has finished preparing for the action and will launch on the attack. The available attacks are combo, which causes many hit points to the enemy, critical, which in addition to damaging the enemy causes his time bar to roll back, in practice it stuns him by preventing him from performing the action he was preparing. The use of special moves and spells requires more preparation time, but they are usually of decisive effectiveness, as well as being particularly spectacular. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Eastern fights Imagine having three party members and four enemies, we will have to try to keep an eye on their bar and cancel their actions with critical hits, in the meantime look for a spell that affects a group and maybe heal someone, when it comes time to set the we will set actions as our characters reach the state of action and off to the dance with the monsters who in turn apply their strategies, often effective such as attacking the weakest or anyone trying to cast a spell. A riot of colors, sounds, battle cries, spectacular animations for casting spells and executing special moves. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Eastern fights In case you are a little stunned by my explanation, I assure you that the combat system will become immediately familiar very soon, also thanks to the ~masters~ with a strange question-shaped hat who will explain all the tactics to succeed with a step-by-step tutorial. best in combat. Some glitches I must say that the fighting phase, as well as the extremely engaging storyline, trigger that familiar syndrome of: I only get to the next save point And yes, Grandia 2 is afflicted by one of the worst diseases that can hit a game of role: the chronic compulsive shortage of the rescue option! [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Some glitches I honestly don't understand why implement this sadistic and perverse saving system also for PC conversion. We PC users are too used to saving when we want, moreover, even in the console world the tendency is to give the player the save option always active. Whatever the reason, it must still be said that the save points are very frequent and always before an important battle in order to avoid the frustration of replaying entire parts because the boss on duty has decimated you. In addition, save points include the recover option which recovers all hit points, mana and special lost so far. Another small problem, always caused by a conversion that pays little attention to the needs of the users of the platform in which it was converted, is the control system. GameArts took the four arrow keys and the other seven used by the game and perfectly mapped in the Dreamcast joypad, assigned them to 11 keys on the PC keyboard and that's it, stop, done. Too bad that PC users are used to moving around an isometric game map by clicking the mouse on the ground, they are accustomed", "date": "2002-02-23", "grade": null}
