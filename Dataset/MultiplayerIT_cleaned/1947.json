The title was released last year on the Epic Game Store and consoles but only a few days ago it made its reappearance on Steam, attracting the ire of those who, at the time, had not looked favorably on the passage as an exclusive on the competing store. A deep-rooted problem that seemed to belong only to console users, that of the console war, but which also exploded ardently among the components of the so-called master race, determined not to miss the latest neighborhood controversy. So from home gaming machines we move on to platforms, with absolutely out of context positions in a market where launching one or the other client wouldn't really make any difference. In this ideological war, obviously, it is the developers themselves who end up paying the price who, in this case, despite a valuable title, have seen their latest effort go quietly, an undeserved punishment for an action/puzzle game that qualities, in reality, it hides several. Let's see why in our Bloodroots review. It all starts with anger A betrayal, the alleged killing of a former criminal gang leader and the desire to take revenge are the pieces that make up the narrative of Bloodroots, a title that seeks in the purest cartoon violence the stimulus to give the player that indispensable spark to chain killing after killing without stopping a moment to think. The introduction to the game world was successful and everything happens so quickly that killing ten opponents in combos, tearing them to pieces with the most disparate tools found on the battlefield, is all too natural. A key to jump, one to grab objects and another to use them to tear the unsuspecting victims to pieces, a very simple and essential but terribly effective management in the controls. Thus was born a title with a purely arcade soul, frenetic and fun, able to involve any type of player looking for an arcade experience and drag him through all the game levels, giving reason to remain glued to the screen even for six or seven hours, while trying to exhaust all the stages with the highest possible score, climb the rankings and why not, maybe even recover the collectibles in the form of a wolf hidden in the most disparate points. A continuous flow of game capable of introducing new mechanics gradually and without ever going to touch up the control scheme: one level will ask you, for example, to hit a tree and make it fall on the house of the boss on duty while in the next one you will already be jumping up a series of barrels while dodging sharp points and deadly traps, all while always remaining focused on the only thing to do in Bloodroots: kill. Bloodroots, the graphic style is really appreciable The independently published title of Paper Cult plays ferociously with death and carnage, but intelligently inserts that cartoonish violence, to ensure that the extreme cruelty of the title is perceived as an unsweetened version of the eternal fight between Tom & Jerry. If at the beginning the situation focuses on seriousness and the weapons you have available fall within the wheel of the classic Viking choices, such as two-handed axes or one-handed maces, already after a few levels the imagination takes over and to pass the stages unscathed you will discover that using an oar as a trampoline and hitting enemies from above or skewering them in series with a skewer are not only options to discard but will also allow you to accumulate many more points than a trivial jab. The fights are thus ringed in rapid succession, where to kill and be killed, a single well-placed shot will suffice, through a trial and error dynamic that is never frustrating but always justly punitive. To prevent the dynamism of the action from getting out of hand, Paper Cult has well thought out to equip each single instrument of death with a very limited number of shots and consequently of possible executions, so as to force you to move continuously in search of the next instrument of death , in an attempt not to let the combo timer run out, which will inexorably try to reset itself: a very high pace that will force you not only to keep your concentration high for the entire duration but will also provide you with a stimulus to kill better and faster, to a convincing and rather amusing end result. Unfortunately the strength of the ideas of an independent team like this collides with the production possibilities and it turns out, not without a touch of regret, that many of the weapons in the game share the same types of attack, reducing the number of feasible strategies and variousage. To try to put a patch on a certain basic repetitiveness, puzzles of a different nature intervene, enemies with protections capable of repelling certain attacks and some platform sections that are not exactly successful. The isometric view, in fact, often confuses and the control system with the keyboard does not appear to be precise enough to move fluidly as one would expect, with often involuntary deaths even in moments of apparent calm. Defects that undermine a generally good product but which struggles, also for this reason, to enter the Olympus of unforgettable pearls.
