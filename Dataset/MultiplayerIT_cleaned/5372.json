Access Denied is the penultimate episode of the new mini-series, but the seventh if we consider the saga as a whole, and despite this it still maintains that sense of novelty that convinces us to follow Jesse and his friends in yet another adventure. After facing a sort of murder mystery in the previous episode, our heroes find themselves in the chamber of portals, which seems to whet their playful spirit, so much so that our first task is to quell the flames that burn Luke's butt . The light tone with which the episode welcomed us fades, however, when Petra, after a heated argument with Jesse, leaves the group and throws herself into a portal, forcing the others to follow her. Our heroes thus find themselves in a world dominated by an artificial intelligence named PAMA, which has installed microchips in the heads of humans and monsters to make them more efficient, or ~useful~, as he likes to repeat. In addition to PAMA we get to know its inventor, the brilliant Harper, who will probably stay with the group in the last episode as well. Both PAMA and Harper are beautifully characterised, adding color to the mix of main characters. And speaking of the characters: Luke, Jesse, Petra and Ivor have evolved from one episode to the next, and those of us who have known them since the beginning will probably have developed a bond with each of them (our favorite continues to be Ivor). Returning to the setting of Access Denied, it is clearly a science fiction story, and although it contains ideas widely explored from books and films over the last twenty years, it feels unusual and original in the world of Minecraft imagined by Telltale. It's also a nice change from the yellow-horror of the previous episode. There's even a fun VR section that Jesse accesses with what looks and feels like a modern gaming headset. So let's follow his example and enter the world of Access Denied. Minecraft: Story Mode - Access Denied pits a thinking computer efficiency freak against us! Even AIs have a Core The narrative formula of the new mini-series works very well. The self-contained episodes united by a common thread (the goal of returning home) allow you to create worlds different from each other without the risk of making a mess. The Access Denied setting offers easy cues for the now classic action scenes of the series, interspersed with the equally awaited pauses for reflection, during which we have to solve simple puzzles. The game system is always the same, with some very timid variations, such as a quick time event based on a textual choice instead of keystrokes. The developers are refining the series with each episode, adding welcome details that increase the overall value of the experience, such as the software version superimposed on the headset screen, but they have not yet taken the plunge towards a new formula. And it's a shame, because the Minecraft universe is by definition a place of experimentation, so why limit yourself to being daring on a narrative level? However, we have the feeling that the series will not end with the next episode, so who knows that in the future there are some other surprises waiting for us. In the meantime we can enjoy Access Denied, which in addition to the typical humor of the series also offers more serious moments, in which our choices do not change the course of history, but at least touch some deep chord, like when we are in front of the heart of PAMA and we hear her begging us not to turn it off. Too bad that the game is only in English, because this limits a lot especially the younger players. If, on the other hand, the foreign language is not an obstacle for you, you have once again the opportunity to enjoy an exceptional voice acting, without which this series would lose much of its luster. Far from wanting to exaggerate the praises of a simple game that never makes you cry out for a miracle, we can however say that Minecraft: Story Mode - Access Denied is the episode we needed to be able to recommend the entire Minecraft narrative saga to the undecided.", "date": "2016-08-02", "grade": "7.5"}
