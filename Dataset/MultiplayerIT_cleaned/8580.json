It must be said, however, that Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's treasure peeps out on the shelves in a moment that is actually a bit suspicious. In this period ~puzzle~ adventures are fashionable, as demonstrated for example by the recent Doctor Lautrec and the Lost Knights, but the first three-dimensional adventure of the forerunner and very famous Professor Layton is still missing on Nintendo 3DS. Curiously, rhythm games are also missing from the playroom of the new Nintendo laptop and it will still be a few months before seeing Theatrhythm Final Fantasy in the West. Therefore, the new SEGA game occupies a strategic position quite interesting because it blends these two types of games in a combination that deserves more than a cursory glance. Professor Phantom? To make sense of this sparkling compilation of musical mini-games there is a decidedly curious plot that mixes comedy, action and mystery in a soup that is perhaps a little obvious at times but certainly interesting. Set almost entirely in Paris, the story has as its protagonist Raphael, a boy who desperately tries to attract the attention of his father who has been missing for years by carrying out spectacular thefts as the gentleman thief Phantom R. And it will be his last throw him against his will in a mysterious conspiracy that revolves around the alleged resurrection of Napoleon Bonaparte: aided by a series of sympathetic supporting actors and in particular by the beautiful violinist Marie, Raphael will naturally have to foil the conspiracy, possibly in time with the music. The latter obviously plays a fundamental role in the whole story, both from a narrative and gameplay point of view: leaving aside the minigames for a moment, the audio sector of Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's treasure is really very good and offers an excellent variety of songs, both originals and remixes of classic pieces . There is therefore a bit of everything in this extravagant story with such a typically Japanese atmosphere, both in the episodic structuring and in the graphic style, further accentuated by various high quality cartoon interludes, moreover made spectacular by the 3D effect. What is less convincing instead is, paradoxically, the pace of the story, excessively slow and punctuated by numerous dialogues and far too long exploratory phases. At times, the plot therefore loses its bite and the various characters with whom it is possible to interact, quite simply, talk too much: in short, between one mini-game and another, sometimes a lot of time passes, and it is a pity because they are undoubtedly the funniest item in the pack, as it should be. We are therefore far from the narrative glories of Level 5's Professor Layton, but it must be said that the SEGA product, from this point of view, is the one that is closest to it. The 3D effect The stereoscopic effect of Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's treasure is a bit controversial, in fact it embellishes above all the interlude sequences and the most spectacular skits, but it is a bit annoying during the mini-games due to the need to move the console, even if only unintentionally. Samba de Thief As you may have already guessed, Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's treasure does not resemble Professor Layton only in the narrative structure, but also in terms of the simple gameplay which, to tell the truth, is structured in the exact same way. Paris and its surroundings are in fact represented through two-dimensional artwork in which to move Raphael to visit various places and talk to the characters present in search of clues that allow us to continue the story. Each screen hides sounds to discover and record, some musical puzzles and ~medals~ very similar to those of Professor Layton, with which it is possible to buy bonuses and aids for the various rhythm mini-games, or the heart of the game. These are more than fifty in total and even if there aren't many types, the variety of choreographies and challenges definitely limits the feeling of repetitiveness. The main musical minigames are essentially of three types that are very reminiscent of what has already been seen in Rhythm Heaven or Elite Beat Agents: in fact we will have to draw lines on the touch-screen with the stylus following the rhythm, press combinations of keys when suggested or shake and move the Nintendo 3DS in one direction or another at the right moment. Among the minigames, the latter is the one that creates some problems, since the console struggles a bit to accurately recognize our movements and this discrepancy often affects the final score, which ishowever, it is possible to improve by repeating the minigame at will after completing it and consequently unlocking it in the appropriate mode. Incidentally, scores can be shared and challenged via StreetPass, offering a hint of multiplayer that is especially intensified in local wireless matches. So, from a content point of view, Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's treasure offers exactly what one would expect: lots of fun and spectacular mini-games, only vaguely repetitive and never really difficult or frustrating. The difficulty level is in fact very well balanced, able to be appreciated both by fans of the genre and by newcomers, for whom a system of suggestions has also been designed which is actually a bit invasive: we advise you to deactivate it if you want to enjoy each mini-game to the fullest without feeling a little nerdy.", "date": "2012-04-23", "grade": "8.0"}
