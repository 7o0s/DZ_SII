{"name": "Crash of the Titans", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crash-of-the-titans.html", "text": "Needless to say, the first impressions provided by Crash of the Titans are truly those of a product capable of bringing the series back to its former glory, thanks to a good dose of originality and respectable graphics. Although not astonishing or revolutionary, the technical sector of the DeValley work certainly appears among the best seen on mobile lately: the scenarios are quite varied as well as rich in color and detail, and the numerous types of enemies offer a refined look to the eye and convincing (not to mention that some of them reach truly considerable dimensions). Honorable mention then for the animations of the marsupial protagonist, numerous and of excellent quality, which contribute to making this latest mobile incarnation of Crash Bandicoot decidedly ~stylish~. In addition to the graphics, the playful premises are also respectable: the Vivendi product leaves the familiar territories of the platform to transform itself into a sort of scrolling fighting game, with our hero capable of performing simple combos and performing the so-called jack, which consists of jumping onto the back of a stunned enemy and taking control of it. Unfortunately, precisely this element - on paper very interesting - is the biggest weak point of Crash of the Titans. Once you take the reins of an opponent, you only have control over his movements (attacks are managed automatically), an absolutely limiting choice that undermines the fun factor of the game: more satisfying -even if not by much- would be to exploit the normal Crash's ability, but unfortunately a ruthless level design requires the user to continuously use the jack, making most of the levels tedious. The various bonuses and power-ups are of little use, the interludes on board a surf and an outlined growth component of the character (in fact, it is possible to exchange the fruits collected with enhancements of the three main attributes of Crash): the DeValley title is mercilessly a victim of the unfortunate stylistic choice mentioned above, which ends up ruining the entire playful experience. With an adequate realization of its key elements, Crash of the Titans could have established itself as a prominent action game, but as it stands, the Vivendi product can only leave you substantially indifferent. PRO Visually excellent Several original ideas... AGAINST ...but done sufficiently It lacks bite Very low level of difficulty", "date": "2007-11-19", "grade": "S.V."}
