You want for the intrinsic quality of what is considered a of the most valid exponents of a genre, that of first-person adventurous shooters; you want for the importance it has always held within the Sony universe. The Guerrilla Games series has in fact become a sort of icon for all the consoles of the Japanese company, with the exception of the first PlayStation, and in this sense Killzone: Mercenary continues the partnership between the two teams, this time on PlayStation Vita and with the development entrusted to Guerrilla Cambridge. The game is a spin-off of the original series, set immediately after the first episode, during the war between the ISA army and the Helghast, although other important events related to the entire trilogy are retraced during the adventure. Users play the role of Arran Danner, a skilled mercenary who works for the Phantom Talon Corp, a private company that provides consultancy and specialized services of a military nature, commanded by Anders Benoit. The protagonist and his colleagues are entrusted with missions to complete in the midst of the conflict, working in favor of those who are willing to pay handsomely for the work. In fact, they fight for money, so they do not distinguish between terrestrial and alien forces. At least until the engagement that provides for the evacuation of Justus, the son of the ambassador of Vektan, from Pyrrhus, during the invasion of the city by the Terran army. Is Killzone: Mercenary really the killer application of PlayStation Vita? The answer to our review Mercenary profession The aforementioned plot acts as a glue to the nine missions that form the single-player campaign, which can be completed in about 8 hours at a normal level, and in general it proves to be quite incisive, albeit not excellent, especially as the adventure progresses. It is told through a series of dialogues with the mercenary headquarters, through in-game events and cutscenes useful to show some crucial event, to highlight a change of objective or an expansion of the front. Going into the details of the gameplay, however, Killzone: Mercenary can be played at three different levels of difficulty, and each operation is structured in such a way as to entice users to replay it several times to try to unlock all the secondary objectives of which the scenarios are fill. Each mission also includes three types of contracts - stealth, demolition and precision - unlockable once the main one is completed. Except in the latter circumstances, where it is required to satisfy particular conditions to complete the level, or those in which one is forced to fight in the old way of first-person shooters for script needs, the title of Guerrilla Cambridge grants the user a certain freedom in the way of approaching the missions, or portions within them, which can therefore also be tackled by acting in the shadows, as in a stealth game. In this sense, the title meets the player thanks to a level design that seems to invite micro-exploration, in search of shortcuts and ravines that can allow the protagonist to act more or less undisturbed in the shadows, remaining hidden from the enemy's sight As long as possible. Action planning sometimes becomes essential to avoid finding yourself against dozens of enemies, proceeding in silence, avoiding surveillance cameras, motion detection systems and using only silenced weapons or your hands to eliminate sentries. In the latter case, the tactile commands of the console come into play. The killings are in fact performed via the PlayStation Vita touch screen: surprise a guard, just press the triangle button and then perform a simple movement of the fingers following the arrow-shaped indication that appears on the video to kill him by breaking his neck or stabbing him in the private parts. These mechanics are also applied in situations of hand-to-hand combat, that is, when the opponents become aware of Danner's presence and react by facing him at close range. The tactile functions of the console, never invasive, are also exploited to shoot enemies from afar, marked for the occasion by an orange circle to be touched with the fingertips to direct the shot, to adjust the zoom of the viewfinder, to violate the systems and to quick interaction with objects and weapons. Even if in the latter case you can, if you wish, opt for the use of the classic commands with levbuttons and buttons, as is basically the case for other functions, i.e. moving or shooting. Whatever the solution adopted to control what happens on the screen, the response to the commands is in any case quick and precise, which makes the playability of the product even more pleasant. Prowess cards Valor Cards are special cards which, in a nutshell, represent the unique abilities of a gamer and his character, where the ace outlines the highest rank and the two the lowest. They allow, through the killzone.com service, to automatically record the statistics of each user within the site, and therefore change positively or negatively according to performance over the 24 hours. They are recoverable at the end of each level in single player mode, or by eliminating enemies in online mode. The more cards you have in your deck, the higher their value in the game rankings. By selling them, you can get money or special weapons in exchange. For money only During the game you can obviously also act in the classic way, i.e. launch in rest, ready to shoot at everything that moves on the screen, thanks to the supplied equipment. The arsenal, largely customizable, certainly stands as one of the strengths of Killzone: Mercenary. The default equipment includes the traditional assault rifle plus knife, pistol, bombs and all the typical mercenary repertoire, but as the story progresses even more devastating and original ones can be recovered between primary and secondary weapons. Grenade launchers, flamethrowers, stun grenades and even poisonous gases, the title offers dozens and dozens of very diversified weapons. The only limit to their availability, when some cannot be recovered in the field, is money. It is thanks to it, in fact, that Danner can obtain the best weapons, upgrades and armor he needs on the black market, and use them in any game mode both in the single-player and multiplayer campaign. To get money you have to rely on the rewards received at the end of each mission, the amount of which also depends on the way the enemies were eliminated (perfect headshots or quick executions will attribute different amounts of money), and other factors such as example the so-called Value cards. The latter, which we discuss in more detail in a special box, are also useful for unlocking new missions, trophies and for climbing the ranks of Killzone's strongest mercenaries. The so-called VAN-GUARDs are added to the aforementioned classic weapons, highly technological gadgets which include, among others, flying drones to be piloted to disturb enemy radars, track the position of guards or to hit enemies with electric shocks. More than the systems useful for recalling attacks carried out via air or satellite support, complete with missiles equipped with automatic lock-on on targets as in the case of the one called Porcupine. These solutions are quite effective, especially those capable of freeing the area from hordes of opponents during the most difficult fights, but they must be used carefully given the long reload times required before being able to perform another shot. Which can be counterproductive for the gamer, given that the opposing soldiers, in the meantime, will certainly not stand by and watch. The enemies are quite smart, especially in the more advanced difficulty levels, and act in a particularly effective and intelligent way. Not infrequently they will try to unite to adopt some tactic, moving in a logical way to attempt encirclement, or properly exploiting the covers to nail the user in his position, forcing him into unnerving shootings. Not to mention that they also have natural reactions in relation to what is happening around them, revealing themselves to be sensitive to environmental noises, to sudden movements in the shadows, or to the discovery of a corpse. However, it must also be said that we rarely find ourselves involved in truly frustrating situations and in this sense, as happened in some ways in Killzone 3, the action gains in depth and intensity. PSVita trophies There are 53 Trophies available in Killzone: Mercenary, divided into 42 Bronze, 8 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum. To unlock them you have to satisfy various requests of increasing difficulty, such as buying every single weapon, gadget or armor on the black market, killing 10,000 enemies, completing online challenges, gradually until you get to the more difficult ones to obtain, such as completing all contract missions on Veteran difficulty level and collect allthe trophies to get the Platinum one. The multiplayer Last but not least, let's talk about multiplayer. The multiplayer sector of Mercenary is well structured and can count on six maps, on a substantial system of customizable classes, to be unlocked by leveling up, on varied mechanics and situations, and on three different game modes for up to eight participants. Among other things, these sessions go hand in hand with the main campaign, given that it is possible, as we mentioned at the beginning, to accumulate money in this context as well to be used in the single player campaign, thanks to the shared monetary system, and therefore it becomes even more interesting and pleasant to play them. The options available for the network game are Mercenaries, in which in the general chaos typical of ~all against all~ users are committed to recovering the largest possible amount of Vektan dollars within a certain time limit, and without being able to count on the help of any ally. Then Guerrilla Warfare, which is none other than the classic team deathmatch between the ISA and Helghast factions and, finally, War Zone, where two groups of contenders face off in a series of five different missions within the same game, in which it is necessary from time to time to achieve a certain goal. These can be to collect a specific item, hack into the VAN-Guard's security pods, capture and interrogate a particular opponent, or kill a certain number of enemies to rack up points. The results of the various trials are then added up at the end, and the team that has scored the most points wins the contest. During the test we carried out for our review there were obviously not many users connected, apart from a few colleagues, therefore we will have to wait for the official launch of the game to be able to fully see the entire online system at work. However, from what we have seen, the servers seemed to us rather ~solid~, for extremely fast matchmaking and practically lag-free matches, even if in a couple of circumstances we were kicked out of the contest in an inexplicable way and in some moments the respawn of the controlled character and that of the opponents did not seem very intelligent to us. For the rest, since the dawn of PlayStation 3, the Killzone series has always been highlighted for the technical sector, for its ambitions to become the most graphically impressive title ever to appear on consoles. Not least this production for PlayStation Vita promised to be a point of reference, from a technical point of view, for the current generation of portable consoles. Well, the title of Guerrilla Cambridge confirms this intention in some ways, and therefore the positive things we have been able to see on the occasion of previous trials. Starting with a very detailed graphics thanks to which it is sometimes hard to believe that everything is running on a portable console. The general quality is high, the level design inspired and the textures in general are very accurate. Sometimes there are still some blurring effects, especially in the distance or in explosions, but in our opinion nothing that compromises the overall quality of the production from a visual point of view. On the other hand, the title uses a modified version of the rendering engine used in Killzone 3, complete with a volumetric lighting system and effects such as the sheen of the metal or a more realistic-looking light and shadow system. The animations and polygonal models of the characters are also well made, which literally fill the entire PlayStation Vita screen, without lending themselves to significant drops in the frame rate, except for a few slight and occasional shots from time to time. In all it is further enriched by a good dubbing in Italian, and an excellent soundtrack that underlines the topical moments of the action, from the simple ambushes preceding an attack from behind the enemy, to the one in which a victim is centered with an accurate sniper shot, up to more spectacular situations characterized by violent shootings and explosions on video.", "date": "2013-09-04", "grade": "9.0"}
