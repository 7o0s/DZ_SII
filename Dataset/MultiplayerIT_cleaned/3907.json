{"name": "Mimpi Dreams per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mimpi-dreams-nintendo-switch-recensione.html", "text": "By virtue of its hybrid nature, Nintendo Switch has quickly become the ideal place to offer titles for quick use, especially indicated for those who intend to alternate more demanding game sessions with others in the name of simplicity and immediacy. Mimpi Dreams also belongs to this second category, a nice platformer developed by SiliconJelly, originally designed for iOS and Android devices. After making his debut five years ago and returning with a second adventure on smartphones and tablets (as well as on PC) in 2016, the cute little dog Mimpi now also lands on Nintendo eShop, bringing with him a very basic but well-tested playful approach. The conversion made by Dreadlocks in turn offers a very classic gameplay, based on the presence of platforms and environmental puzzles, where the traditional control system is alternated with the use of touch screen controls integrated into the Switch hardware. Here's what our feelings were after having had the opportunity to play it. Mimpi's sweet dreams Anyone who owns or has owned at least one dog in the course of their life cannot fail to feel a natural sense of sympathy towards Mimpi, the furry protagonist of the game. If you belong to the category, it won't even surprise you to know that our intrepid four-legged friend loves to get some good sleep curled up in his warm and comfortable bed. Starting from the above assumptions, maybe sometimes you will have wondered if even dogs ever dream. The developers started from this simple question, imagining seven two-dimensional worlds born from the dreamlike wanderings of the creature that lends its name to the work. The result is a nice, relaxing and unpretentious journey within settings that alternate the presence of platforms with the resolution of very basic puzzles. The same simplicity also pervades the narration, entrusted solely to the on-screen representation of the actions performed by the characters and to the use of a series of cartoons in which visual communication takes the place of words. On the other hand, this is exactly what one is led to think when one imagines an animal's way of reasoning. The main limitation of Mimpi Dreams, at least in the eyes of an already experienced player, lies in its extreme simplicity. In some phases it is necessary to alternate the use of the analog stick, used to manage the movements of the protagonist, with the management of touch interaction. The result is elementary but well thought out solutions such as the activation of mechanical devices, the movement of objects and the alteration of the scenario in order to unlock the passage towards the end of the level. From this point of view, the formula proposed on mobile has been kept substantially unchanged. The available levels follow each other without interruption, allowing you to reach the epilogue in less than two hours. Nonetheless, the opportunity to resort to a series of visual clues has still been preserved, which can be collected along the way and then used if necessary if you get stuck while solving a puzzle. An eventuality all in all more plausible on mobile, where the user base is on average more casual than any other gaming platform, including Nintendo. To be honest, in this case at least a small foresight has been introduced, aimed at those who want to add a little spice to the levels offered by Mimpi Dreams: by selecting the Challenge mode it is in fact possible to tackle the seven levels currently available having one life. In this case the main objective is therefore to go as long as possible along the route without making mistakes. Moreover, even by accessing this section, the game maintains a rather marginal degree of difficulty, given that the individual stages were not designed to test the user's skills.", "date": "2018-12-09", "grade": "7.0"}
