{"name": "L'orrore di Gloomywood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/180818-2dark-lorrore-di-gloomywood.html", "text": "If they ask you who is the progenitor of survival horror, the first answer that comes to mind is undoubtedly Resident Evil and probably no one would correct you. However, to be honest, many concepts of survival horror of that type, the puzzles, the fixed camera and the dark atmosphere had already been brought to light by a 1992 game: Alone in the Dark. The game designer of that title is called Frdrick Raynal, a French author who two years later takes care of another important title for the time: Little Big Adventure. Now, after years away from horror and six years after his last game, Frdrick is back to his first love with 2Dark, a distressing game with an isometric view that mixes puzzles and stealth and that will ask us to complete a mission very important: to save children. 2Dark is a horror that will challenge you with a decidedly macabre atmosphere In bed the children In 2Dark we will have to explore labyrinths and dark places that have become the hunting grounds of serial killers who have kidnapped and sometimes killed children. It should be clarified immediately that despite the cartoonish appearance we are dealing with a game that is not ashamed to dive headfirst into the darkest parts of the human soul, showing in some cases scenes in which not only are there dead children, but they are also deprived of their innards or used for horrific experiments that we will let you discover. We happened to find a child imprisoned alive in a chest full of corpses, witness episodes of cannibalism and so on. The faint of stomach be warned. Our alter ego is called Mr Smith, an ordinary man who lost everything one fine day, when his wife was brutally killed and the children kidnapped during a very peaceful camping trip. After the prologue we find him 17 years later, alone, tormented by remorse, by a sense of emptiness and without work. All he can do is embark on a personal crusade to rid the city of Gloomywood of the assassins that inhabit it and free the children who may still be saved. To succeed in our task we will have to move carefully, avoid traps, take advantage of the objects that we will find around and above all not make noise, taking advantage of the dark and the weak light of a torch which obviously will run out at the wrong time. Each level will offer an increasingly tough level of challenge, in which very often we will be forced to start from scratch or from the last save because perhaps we have not seen that trap or the tension has led us to be discovered and killed by the henchman on duty. If you like to go on trial and error you will feel at home, otherwise remember to save often. Alone in the dark 2Dark is a title almost entirely focused on stealth. Being discovered means in most cases being killed, especially in the more advanced levels. The only solution to survive is to avoid conflict when possible, hide in the dark, leave no footprints and strike from behind. In fact, surprise attacks will almost always kill the enemy on the spot. If we want we can take advantage of the firepower of a gun, but the shots will be very few and we will make so much noise that we will often attract unwanted attention. Avoiding melee will also allow us not to have to rely on the control system, which doesn't cause major problems in the exploration phase, but isn't particularly accurate when it comes to being precise and sensibly detecting collisions. Running away quickly, aiming, continuously clicking on an enemy to hit him with a fist or a stick are activities that require a certain skill and alertness, but sometimes the game seems not to understand our commands. We happened to have a fist fight with an enemy and witness the ridiculous scene of two men who whirl shots at a very short distance from each other without hitting each other, not the best for a game that focuses entirely on the atmosphere. Another part of the yoke that you often have to struggle with is inventory. Having two hands we will be able to use only two things at the same time and the object we hold is indicated with the small symbol of a hand next to its icon. The problem is that the symbol is red like the menu and this does not allow you to have a good glance right away. To combine several items from our menu we will have to drag one of the two towards each other, for example the batteries towards the torch, an operation which can be cumbersome, especially if we are fleeing or carrying the children safely. As for the PC version, we don't know if the performance is better on consoles. Atmosphere is everything Once we have found a child we will in fact have to approach him, perhaps using a candy (yes, however absurd we will have to convincere a child abused to follow us offering the proverbial candy of the stranger), which we can also throw around to trigger traps or distract enemies. When the child starts following us, we can tell him to stop for a moment, perhaps because we have to eliminate a threat, or to be slow, trying to get him safely to the exit. If desired, we can also escort several children at the same time, although obviously it risks being a tough bet to win. Saving those poor souls is undoubtedly an exciting moment that confirms the excellent work done by the developers regarding the atmosphere. In fact, despite a graphic that recalls the Amiga period, excluding the polygonal models of the characters, the environments are full of rather macabre splatter details, accompanied by a sound sector that is probably one of the best successful parts of the game. The same cannot be said of the artificial intelligence of the enemies which sometimes seems to know where we are for no apparent reason, while in other cases it ignores us as if we were ghosts. Overall, therefore, we have a series of ups and downs which, despite an interesting basic idea, show a not exactly excellent realization that prevents the game from taking off.", "date": "2017-03-10", "grade": "7.8"}
