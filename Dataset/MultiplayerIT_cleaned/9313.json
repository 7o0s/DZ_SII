We are talking about Virtua Tennis 4, obviously, the new evolution of a title that has made the history of this sport in the videogame field, starting from the coin-op machines and passing from Dreamcast to the current platforms. Years go by and developers take turns but the style remains faithful to tradition, therefore also the fourth Virtua Tennis exudes Japanese ~spirit~ from every pixel, starting from the beautiful colorful animated presentation - from which one would expect to see the Sega's classic intense blue sky - to arrive on the field, where the immediacy typical of the series is confirmed as the watchword adopted by the developers. Developers who, moreover, are precisely the AM3, Sega's internal label, author of the original first chapter back in 1999 on the ~Naomi~ card, and returned to take over the reins of Japanese tennis after the Sumo Digital parenthesis. There's a lot of tradition in Virtua Tennis 4, then, but what about what's new? There are also those, it must be said, and they certainly evolve the structure of the game making it take several steps forward, while still leaving it tied to a gameplay that, on the field, appears a bit stale at times. The contemporaneity with Top Spin 4 perhaps represents the greatest defect for this Sega title: beyond the intrinsic defects, it is then the indisputable qualities of an excellent direct opponent that decisively penalize the new Virtua Tennis. The long way to the summit From a content point of view, there are a good number of options and game modes, packaged in the classic Sega style with simple and intuitive menus and pure arcade spirit. Exhibitions, tournaments in the arcade mode, single and double tennis mini-games or online game with the possibility of using one of the many champions of the present and the past (male and female) present in the roster, accompany what appears as the mode main for the single player: career. This setting represents a novelty of sure impact even for the most experienced Virtua Tennis player. After creating your own tennis player through the classic editor, we find ourselves moving a pawn within a vast map that represents the athlete's path in the world launched towards climbing the rankings. The pawn moves on squares placed on different paths, which can be followed by choice, each of which represents a different event in the sportsman's life, including training sessions, exhibitions, tournaments or even meetings with fans and opportunities to relax. Moving on the grid takes place through discards imposed by some cards that are drawn by lot and contain the number of boxes on which we can pass, generating a random and forced element in the movement of the character, with the possibility of choosing between three different cards and therefore giving the possibility of planning a minimum of the route of our sample. In advancing among the various possibilities, one must always keep in mind the player's fatigue rate, which periodically requires him to rest in the appropriate relaxation boxes (provided that he has the possibility to happen upon them), the amount of money possessed capable of buy special cards that can modify a shift on the map (or buy new clothes and accessories at the shop) and the amount of stars that determine the protagonist's degree of skill and fame, allowing him to access various increasingly exclusive sporting events. There is a limited number of days during which it is possible to unravel the tennis player's career, therefore it is necessary to make prudent choices and not to tire the player too much in order not to run into injuries and serious waste of time. The virtues of the tennis player The evolution of the tennis player takes place constantly by facing the various events that will arise in the career mode, between real matches and training sessions. Each result determines a variable contribution of experience points which are distributed in the various technical characteristics of the tennis player and determine his style and general level of skill. The statistics concern shooting skills, defensive skills, tactics and sub-network and each of these can be more or less trained according to the various types of training and cHow we behave in the field, determining different specializations. Once we have reached a sufficient level in the various statistics we will be able to access the ~style lessons~, also these referring to the various skills described above and able to add the possibility of a special shot to the player's repertoire of basic maneuvers. This special shot is activated by loading a bar which increases with the execution of techniques related to the specialization chosen for the tennis player and which, once full, is able to release a devastating power shot to which the opponent will hardly be able to respond. duty. Although this solution may seem a bit risky for balancing the game, it should be remembered that we are in a deeply arcade context and that in any case this ~super move~ requires a good deal of time to be able to load, thus making it relatively the moments of activation of the special shot are rare, which however triggers a series of highly spectacular animations and shots, inserting itself perfectly within the gameplay and thus varying the routine of the clashes on the field. Arcade spirit and PlayStation Move In fact, the management of the characteristic skills and the consequent special shot turn out to be the only introductions of tactical depth within Virtua Tennis 4, which otherwise remains largely linked to the typically arcade gameplay of the series. The fact of developing a particular special ability activates the relative ~critical~ hit, which requires the continuous use of a certain strategy to be loaded. For example, if we choose the ~aggressive volley~, we will have to concentrate as much as possible on the shots at the net in order to load the bar of the special shot, just as it will be necessary to prevent the opponent from concentrating on his specific technique to prevent him from reaching his super move. It is certainly an unrealistic vision of tennis but functional in adding a certain tactical depth to the gameplay. For the rest, the normal course of the game follows the typical style of the series, with a few shots available (flat, cut, top spin and lob) without further modifiers, a rather immediate response from the player to solicitations and the absence of any factor tiredness, which makes potentially infinite exchanges possible. While in Top Spin 4 the setting of the controls and the energy bar gives the impression of dealing with ~real~ players, in Virtua Tennis 4 it seems to be dealing with mechanical automatons, which certainly makes it more immediate the immersion in the game but also much less deep the gameplay. A special mention should be made for the implementation of motion detection controls, Kinect and Move. The tested version is the PlayStation 3 one, so we tried the game using PlayStation Move, a choice that activates a special mode within the main menu. Move therefore does not represent an alternative to the main control system in normal modes, but is relegated to a mode of its own that allows you to engage in exhibition matches or within various mini-games, but it is not possible, for example , participate in the career using this control system, which severely limits its use. The motion detection is well implemented and the game therefore manages to convincingly replicate forehands, backhands and volleys, although some doubts remain about the exact reproduction of the wrist movement and the amplitude of the movement, given that it is often possible to trigger well settle down even just hinting at the movement without physically reproducing it properly. The dynamic framing used in matches with Move is quite bizarre: the idea of adopting a first-person view at the moment of the shot is very appreciable, which makes it clear the position of the ball with respect to the player and therefore allows good timing in 'trigger the movement, but the fact that the camera fluctuates continuously between the first and third person (to which it returns immediately after the ball has been hit), while always returning a good view of the game, can be quite annoying for a long time go. Playstation 3 trophies 49 trophies are distributed throughout the various game modes, from career to online matches. There are obviously those achievements that are automatically unlocked by progressing within the career but a large part require a certain commitment in all sections of the game, therefore the complete collection presents itself as no mean feat. Updated amarcord The graphic aspect fits perfectly in the style of the series, with a clean and colorful impact starting from the menus and the border elements to finishivave up to the actual game. The action is always fast and fluid in perfect arcade style, with good modeling of the tennis players and excellent rendering of the fields, which obviously change the behavior of the ball and the players (albeit marginally) depending on the composition of the terrain. Making a comparison with the usual direct competitor, Top Spin 4, the Sega product seems to have remained somewhat behind. The polygonal models are good although a bit lanky, the characters taken from reality are also likely but the animations are sometimes a bit disconnected, especially in the sudden changes of direction, reinforcing the unrealistic feeling that characterizes the whole game. Another note of demerit regarding the models taken from licensed players, which, although similar in shape to the real ones, do not enjoy practically any customization as regards the animations, thus showing themselves all more or less the same and in any case distant from their real counterparts , regarding standard jabs as well as gestures of annoyance or satisfaction. Bizarre, albeit perfectly in line with the Japanese Sega arcade style, the audio accompaniment, with ~verses~ in some cases rather questionable by the players and the usual semi-digital electric guitars that have made the history of the brand and in general of the Sega atmosphere, not that much pleasant but undoubtedly of amarcord.", "date": "2011-05-02", "grade": "7.5"}
