However, it is equally true that if you had the pleasure of getting to know it in advance, or simply you had taken the trouble to investigate what was already known about the game before its release, you would all have noticed its great potential. What we then found on the plate at launch turned out to be even more interesting than we could have expected. After eight months, a physical version arrives on the market, distributed in the major territories, and the full-bodied Seed of Evil DLC, which adds new areas, a further story and a new mutant. All this goodness is also revealed on Nintendo's hybrid flagship, which tries to flex its muscles, but unfortunately fails where time and the group's knowledge of the machine make all the difference in the world. The search for Eden on a grid Mutant Year Zero is nothing more than the adaptation of a Scandinavian board game, well known in cold European countries and much less known elsewhere. Set in the neighboring Swedish areas, it tells of a now devastated Earth and a post-apocalyptic setting with some highly imaginative grafts. The protagonists of the game are initially a large tusked pig (so we could also say that it is more of a wild boar, but this is played a lot) and a brainy duck. Both represented with human traits, consciences, positive and equally negative aspects. Over time, three other mutants will join the merry gang. The goal will soon prove to be to reach Eden, an unexplored place and considered as a mirage, but which is said to be the only real paradise on earth that still exists. From here a campaign made up of clashes and exploration unfolds, as well as many gameplay elements that have made this Mutant Year Zero not a great commercial success (unfortunately) but a cult title for all fans of the genre. What distinguishes Mutant Year Zero from most of the strategic ones is its ability to insert some contaminating elements into the whole, such as the free exploration of the areas (with relative loot), a main hub in which to spend resources to buy or craft tools and weapons and, more importantly, a stealth enemy approach system, which can really make a difference. This is especially true at high difficulties and with permadeath active, which can only be chosen at the beginning of the game, unlike a difficulty level that can be easily changed even during construction. The stealth system is the simplest and most intuitive one can think of. If normally in a strategic game you are called to deploy your troops and, turn after turn, it is necessary to knock down your opponents, Mutant Year Zero allows you to take advantage of a silent walk that reduces the enemy's circle of attention and allows you to anticipate the move. The possibility of killing enemies stealthily in these phases is also particularly functional: in doing so you will greatly reduce the enemy's mouths of fire, helping you a lot. All these elements mix well, leaving some doubts only on the real usefulness of many of the accumulated things. The matter of mutations is different, skills that we will be able to enhance by spending specific points and which add actions that can be performed or characteristics to be enhanced. The switch version... As much as we continue to try, always trying to give the right space to the Nintendo Switch versions, it is still the largest teams that are able to give the Nintendo hybrid an important conversion. In fact, often the scarcity of resources and personnel pushes many smaller developers to rough and poorly finished porting. This is precisely the case with Mutant Year Zero which, despite what one can hope, arrives on Switch with a technically poor version, full of aliasing and with details that to call low is to reward with a big compliment. Although the PC version of the game was visually appealing and embellished with quality effects and models, the Switch version is unfortunately a pain for the eyes which, however, is at least free from frame drops and indeed is played with a fair fluidity. Difficult to think of a game with a less frenetic pace than that of Mutant Year Zero, but the fact remains that the fluidity always makes you smile positively These poor technical performances are visible almost equally in both docked and portable mode, with the latter manages to be arguably even worse, with a resolution bordering on acceptable and a lot of artifacts that are difficult to digest. Not even the day one patch, which still has aupdated a build that was erroneously distributed digitally with the resolution of many problems, it still managed to give the game the right result, or at least the one it deserves.", "date": "2019-08-04", "grade": "7.5"}
