{"name": "Sexy Poker Manga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sexy-poker-manga.html", "text": "It is all too clear what can be expected from a game called ~Sexy Poker Manga~, which is a classic strip poker with female characters drawn using the style of Japanese comics (~manga~, in fact). And Gameloft seems to have no intention of revolutionizing the genre, presenting a title with classic mechanics that can differ from its competitors perhaps only due to the simultaneous presence of three card games instead of just one. The substance, however, is the usual: you face one of the five girls with the aim of making them lose as much money as possible. Having reached zero, the player will have to bet on a garment to get more money... and the game will end, as is clear, when one of the two is defeated. If you win, it means that the girl will be left completely naked, complete with ~Japanese~ censorship on her private parts (censorship, indeed, made badly). Initially it is only possible to try your hand at classic poker, but after a couple of victories the other two games available are also unlocked, namely blackjack and video poker (which differs from normal poker because you only bet initially and then immediately change the cards) . There are two game modes, one for the quick game and one for the ~complete game~, which gives us the possibility to face all the girls one at a time, selecting them based on their skill. At any time it is possible to make the on-screen interface disappear to look at the background image (the girl, of course), and there is a special ~gallery~ mode where you can select an already defeated girl and strip her of all clothes at will ... As in any strip poker, however, just bet big and in most cases you can get the better of your opponent. Technically, Sexy Poker Manga doesn't scream miracles, that's for sure. The fundamental element of the game lies in the quality of the girls' drawings, and let's say that the level is decent. For the rest, there isn't much to say: the commands are based on the use of the joystick and the FIRE button (or 5 on the numeric pad) and they don't respond very quickly, but in this type of product it is a defect that can be forgiven . The sound sector consists of quite pleasant background music (it is the midi of a well-known international song) and a series of nice effects, which do their job decently.
