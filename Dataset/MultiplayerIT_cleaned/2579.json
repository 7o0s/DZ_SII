I apologize for my brief poetic digression, certainly questionable but which certainly did not claim to represent the introduction to the title I am about to tell you about. The Star Wars film series does not require any kind of presentation, given that the fame achieved by the saga produced by Lucasfilm is such that probably only extraterrestrials have never heard of it. Instead, it may be useful to tell you about LucasArts. The videogame division of Lucasfilm has gained a certain notoriety in the world of PC games in recent years thanks to a series of titles inspired by Star Wars. The highly popular license has often been accompanied by games of excellent value, such as the legendary X-Wing, the progenitor of a genre, which has undergone a great expansion since its release. After the PCs, it was also the turn of the consoles which welcomed the legendary ~Star Wars~ with good quality productions, even if not always successful. Star Wars Starfighter is instead the first title, inspired by Episode 1 of the series, to land on PlayStation 2, bringing all the excitement and spectacularity of the air-space combats admired in the film to the console. The Salvation of Naboo The plot of Starfighter takes very little from Episode 1, even if the forces in the field are the same. The game allows us to take control of three different pilots, and therefore as many ships, whose point of view we will take according to the situation and the mission. The first, Rhys Dallows, is a freshman who after realizing his dream of joining the Bravo Squadron, immediately takes the field to defend Naboo, his home planet. The second is instead Vana Sage, a mercenary who collaborates with the Trade Federation but who does not digest the behavior of the latter. Last comes Nym, an unscrupulous pirate on the run from Vana Sage, hired by the Federation to capture him. The three pilots, I won't tell you how, will decide to join forces in order to save Naboo and the entire galaxy from the machinations of the Trade Federation by fighting far and wide through 14 missions and 3 worlds. You will taste my lasers! Each of the missions will present a number of objectives to complete, which in turn include some bonuses which, if achieved, give access to some additional missions, including multiplayer modes, unlockable after completing all missions. The 14 main levels, unique and different from each other, will see us engaged in various types of actions. And so we can weave out of a winding canyon with Rhys's N-1 Starfighter, or steal a freighter from the Trade Federation piloting Nym's Havoc. To tell the truth, 14 missions seemed few to me, even if to unlock the bonus missions we will have to play each level more than once. The control of the ships turns out to be easy to master and so it won't take long to be able to perform incredible evolutions among dozens of enemy fighters. The clashes in the skies of Naboo, or in space, will develop with great intensity. We will often find ourselves surrounded by waves of enemies intent on reducing us to dust. Fortunately, we are too good to perish so miserably, and almost effortlessly, we will make a clean sweep of the bad guys in a few minutes. Movie or video game? The graphic quality of Starfighter makes the entire game more like a movie than a video game. High definition, absence of aliasing and detailed textures finally honor the emotion engine of the PlayStation 2. Starfighter, perhaps excited by the encounter with the powerful Hardware of the Sony console, sporadically indulges in some slowdowns of the graphics engine which, not particularly annoying, they will make the most fussy turn up their noses. The ships enjoy an excellent workmanship as well as the game scenarios, rich in colors and light effects. The sound is another strong point of the game, thanks also to the good quality translation and dubbing, in Italian. The highly evocative music, on the other hand, is the icing on the cake for a title that from a technical point of view can boast very few rivals on PS2. Star Wars wins again In conclusion I have no doubts about how to conclude this review. Star Wars Starfighter achieves excellence thanks to an excellent global implementation. An enthralling, spectacular game whose only negative points are therelative brevity and the aforementioned framerate issues. However, we are faced with one of the maximum expressions of the PS2, and for this reason it is advisable not only for Star Wars fans but also for all owners of the black monolith. Give it a chance....it's worth it. Pros: Compelling and spectacular Graphics and sound of excellent workmanship It's Star Wars Cons: A bit short Occasional slowdowns Immense, silent, dark, the universe appears to us without borders. A long series of questions awaits an answer that perhaps not even time will be able to give. So why ask why such infinity, why investigate something that does not give clues or glimpses of truth? The stars, so distant and unreachable, seem to want to escape from my gaze. I would like to take one from the sky and place it next to our sun, which lights up our days, but which must suffer from a loneliness that has lasted since the mists of time. Maybe it's better that I stop dreaming and dedicate myself to the Star Wars Starfighter review... what do you think friends? :)", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
