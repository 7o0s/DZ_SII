{"name": "Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/atari-masterpieces-vol-1.html", "text": "I wasn't there and if I was there I slept Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1 simply appears for what it is, that is a collection of 12 historical productions of a software house that more than many others can be defined as a pioneer of the video game. Asteroids, Battlezone, Black Widow, Millipede, Missile Command, Red Baron, Lunar Lander and Super Breakout are the first names of a high-sounding list, which is completed with 2600 Adventure, 2600 Surround, 2600 Video Chess and 2600 Yar's Revenge, these last not available initially. Pure gold for the nostalgic, who can only enjoy knowing that we are talking entirely about versions that are faithful in all respects to the originals, without modifications, restyling or frills of any kind. What is certain is that for every retro gamer who rejoices there will be average users who will remain indifferent or even turn up their noses in the face of primitive cosmetic solutions and disarmingly simple gameplay, and considering how the latter certainly represent a greater percentage of the public, it is evident that Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1 is not born with the pretensions of becoming a blockbuster. Indeed, it is not excessive to say that the Atari collection can be a source of interest only and exclusively for the hardest and purest retrogamers: in short, nobody really believes the tale of ~making younger players discover the classics of video games~ . Returning to the actual product, Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1 initially offers only the first eight games on the list, with the remaining four unlockable with hi-score shots: with the same method it is also possible to access some extra contents, among which they deserve I mention some interesting videos of an interview with the founder of the software house, Nolan Bushnell. The N-Gage Arena feature is only supported in terms of online scoreboards, where you can upload your own best scores and compare them with other users. A history refresher Let's now go for a quick analysis of the eight games initially available in Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1, just to refresh the memory of those who already know them and to illustrate them to newbies. Asteroids is a classic shoot 'em up in which you have to take control of a spaceship struggling with inertia and above all with clusters of asteroids to shoot at: the gist of the game lies in carefully directing the spaceship's movements and making watch out for the space rocks, which once hit split into smaller, faster and more dangerous pieces. Battlezone is a daring (at least for the time) first-person shooter in which you have to drive a tank in order to destroy the enemy tanks with cannon fire: the peculiarity of the title is the random respawn of enemies, which makes it as frenetic as frustrating. Black Widow is, again, a shoot 'em up: this time the protagonist is a spider capable of shooting in four directions (assigned to as many keys) who must take out hostile creatures and at the same time collect their prey. Millipede, a sequel to the classic Centipede, puts the player at the controls of a ship placed at the bottom of the screen, to be used to block the advance of the centipede: this is possible by shooting directly at the creature or at the surrounding terrain, creating blocks. Missile Command requires the user to counter a rain of bombs using rockets: correct aiming is essential which must also take into account the radius of the explosions, through which it is possible to take out more bombs in one go. Red Baron is practically Battlezone with wings: the view is always in first person and the player's task is always to shoot enemies while avoiding their fire. The presence of planes instead of tanks adds a bit more dynamism. Lunar Lander is perhaps the weakest of the whole package: in this game you have to command a lunar probe, avoiding obstacles and paying attention to the level of fuel left. It can feel extremely limited and frustrating. Finally, Super Breakout does not even deserve explanations: it is the simple reprise of one of the most exploited playful quids in the world, that of the racket with which to bounce a ball towards a series of blocks, with the intention of destroying them all. Comment Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1, by its very nature, is a title indicated almost exclusively to nostalgics who have spent their childhood filling cabinets with hundred-lire coins: all the others (i.e. the vast majority of users) could hardly find great satisfactions in a collection of games as seminal as they are objectively outdated. Even considered only as a niche product, however, Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1 certainly cannot deend up astonishing, since it is ultimately a simple accumulation of classics already re-proposed in other collections. Dedicated only to N-Gage owners truly passionate about retrogaming.Pros 12 games in original version Discreet extra content Cons Only for a few nostalgic Titles already seen in other collections Some very frustrating games A modern console cannot be defined as such if it does not offer, within its playful panorama, at least a collection of great video game classics. Not that this kind of product is a reflection of the actual potential of a hardware (indeed), but due to an unwritten law of the industry, by now all platforms cannot exempt themselves from this obligation. And Nokia's N-Gage certainly couldn't be an exception...", "date": "2005-12-27", "grade": null}
