The definitive machine for lovers of SEGA arcades, which actually made up the bulk of the toy library. An undoubted advantage on the one hand, an equally undoubted disadvantage on the other, given that home gaming systems were asked (and are asked) to be multipurpose, therefore to offer immediate and frenetic experiences but also alternatives of greater depth and solidity. However, let's not end up off topic, because the arrival of Crazy Taxi on the App Store (and on Google Play, but it seems a little late...) is certainly an occasion to celebrate, throwing ourselves headlong into the crazy races of four taxi drivers who compete to bring as many customers as possible to their destination, with the aim of obtaining the highest income in the space of a few minutes. Axel, B.D. Joe, Gena and Gus each have different characteristics in terms of speed, accuracy and acceleration, elements that make the difference as soon as we start a game. Crazy Taxi's gameplay should be familiar to everyone, but a little refresher for novices never hurts. We are located in a city very similar to San Francisco, therefore with long alternating ups and downs and a lot of traffic, and our task, as mentioned above, is to obtain the highest possible income according to a checkpoint structure that increases the seconds available every time we take a customer to their destination. To take a passenger, all we have to do is stop in his vicinity, and in the same way the ~delivery~ takes place by stopping in a highlighted area of the scenario. Throughout the journey we are guided by an arrow that shows us where to go, trying to avoid collisions and not lose precious moments, because never as in this case is it a matter of racing against time. Perfect in its imperfection There are three modes available: ~Arcade~, ~Original~ and ~Crazy Box~, the latter consisting of skill challenges in which we will be asked to jump from the trampoline, ring drifts and complete missions of various kinds, as more and more complex. The first two modes can be played according to the arcade rules, therefore with each run completed which increases the number of seconds available, or for three, five or ten minutes, in a more ~relaxed~ way. The control system has two possible configurations: the default one sees two buttons in the lower left part of the screen for steering left and right, and two other buttons in the right part of the screen for accelerating and braking (or proceeding in reverse); the alternative one instead assigns steering wheel control to the accelerometer. Both, unfortunately, show their side to more or less serious problems: the touch controls are evidently ~digital~ and not progressive, therefore they do not allow us to brush the curves nor, much less, to avoid unwanted impacts at the last second (and keep in mind that passing close to another vehicle results in obtaining a bonus), with the result that we will crash a lot more than we should. However, the accelerometer controls are even worse, given that the inclination of the device for such tight curves is not the best in terms of practicality, reliability and precision. The technical sector takes up that of the original Crazy Taxi, with an exciting soundtrack signed by the Offspring and Bad Religion, while the graphics are very fluid and lively, but suffer from a very evident pop-up effect and, in general, a poor definition.", "date": "2012-10-22", "grade": "S.V."}
