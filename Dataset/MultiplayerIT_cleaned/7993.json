{"name": "Stagione di caccia 3.0", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/114935-crysis-3-stagione-di-caccia-30.html", "text": "Two calendar years have passed since the release of Crysis 2, a production celebrated by good critical responses and satisfactory sales results, yet at the same time criticized, both by the PC public, dissatisfied with the non-revolutionary technical aspect, and by the more experienced players, who they had found it inconsistent in the quality of gameplay offered. Approaching Crysis 3, perhaps the final chapter of the saga, it is clear how Crytek has been able to listen, and has decided to respond directly to the criticisms received. The result is a complex shooter, rich in detail both in the lush settings and in the many aspects of its gameplay, unexpectedly crowned by an engaging, if not original, story. The player has been firmly placed at the center of this mosaic, the fulcrum around which the whole experience revolves. Although it offers simple tasks, such as getting from point A to point B, Crysis 3 is a game that manages to make you feel free and protagonists, and this is not a common goal, nor a negligible one. They call me Prophet The plot of Crysis 3 kicks off 24 years after the events of the predecessor, a period of time necessary to justify the profound transformation undergone by New York due to Ceph technology. In fact, if the Big Apple was the protagonist of the second episode, the various landmarks clearly visible, in this third chapter the Crytek designers gave free rein to their creativity, proposing an environment in full post-apocalyptic revival, a territorial renaissance where the ruins of of man and the uncontrolled growth of nature have merged to form an unprecedented, impressive and very varied ecosystem. Needless to reveal further details on the development, which also reserves interesting implications, thus filling the limits of the story of the previous chapter, overall insipid. Some events still appear rather hasty, and not always properly explained, but the relationship between the protagonist Prophet and his fellow soldier Psycho (already charismatic protagonist of the spin-off Crysis Warhead) proves to be interesting in its human aspects, making the supporting actor with an accent much more than a comic sidekick. As already guessed in the direct tests of the last few months, the story of Crysis 3 also investigates the contamination suffered by Prophet due to Ceph technology, asking questions about what actually matters more, the human being or the means at his disposal. A few twists and spectacular filmed interludes (all strictly in the first person) make up an above-average narrative mix for the shooter genre, capable of culminating in a predictable, but nevertheless satisfying and accomplished ending. Hunting season 3.0 The restructuring carried out by Crytek began with the identification of the most interesting aspect of the gameplay offered by the entire Crysis saga, namely the hunting metaphor. Superman perpetually at work behind enemy lines, the player must find ways to use their powers to adapt and switch roles, transforming from hunted to hunter. Although the open-face approach is always widely supported, Crysis 3 places particular emphasis on the stealth element, providing the player with an irreplaceable tool in this sense. In addition to showing off a great scenic impact, the bow Prophet has been equipped with since the first mission perfectly embodies the essence of hunting. It allows you to kill silently from reasonable distances, without interrupting your invisibility, yet it is equipped with a limited number of ammunition (only nine standard arrows and six special ones, the first recoverable from corpses, however exposing yourself to the enemy), it has long operating times between one shot and another and is ineffective if not activated with the right calm. In fact, not pulling the string completely will often lead to having to insert a second arrow to eliminate the target, wasting precious time and complicating things. Between benefits and disadvantages, the bow is still configured as an extraordinary weapon both in its characterization and in its versatility of use, further expanded by the special arrows (electric, with explosion on impact or detonation delayed by a few seconds). The rest of the arsenal recovers some typical weapons of the predecessors, such as the inevitable SCAR 2 assault rifle and the Jackal shotgun, or the Mike, a microwave weapon capable of ~cooking~ opponents from medium distance, and other interesting novelties , such as the Typhoon, characterized by its impressive rate of fire, without forgetting the fixed positions (detachable and transportable), the JAW rocket launcher and the guns. If the weapons of the Crynet are joined by alien ones, now finally usable, the arsenalthe result is really full-bodied, without forgetting the possibility of customizing most of the guns in real time, with sights, secondary ammunition and improvements to stability, through the same interface already seen in the predecessor. There is therefore no shortage of tools for hunting, big game or stalking, but what is a hunter without the ability to track down and follow his prey? So here comes the viewer, an instrument already present in the previous chapter, here transformed and revised. Instead of proposing the various tactical solutions to complete a level, the new patrol interface is limited to ensuring that the player can mark the enemies present, also tracking them from a distance and through walls, subsequently reporting them on the mini-map. In addition, appropriate icons reveal the possible presence of ammo boxes, upgrade kits for the Nanosuit to collect or special containers crammed with weapons. The new viewer also gives access to a gameplay feature of Crysis 3, known as hacking. This mechanic, which can only be activated on some specific objects, allows you to open doors, disable security systems, make automatic turrets target the enemy, and even incapacitate some Cephs for several seconds. First, however, you will need to get close to the target, and complete a mini-game that requires you to stop fast-moving cursors on the screen, with greater or lesser difficulty depending on your safety level. Failure to complete the mini-game within the time limit will briefly disable the suit's powers, exposing the player to the enemy. The analysis of the tools described so far is more than sufficient to confirm how Crysis 3 represents a real hunting ground, with the player led to develop from time to time a relationship with his enemies that is so reminiscent of that between cat and mouse . Above all, the new viewer allows a much freer approach to gameplay, without suggesting a series of predefined paths, if anything, emphasizing the first-person exploration of the extensive levels, so as to identify the weak points, the precious resources and the chances of infiltration. An operation that proves to be gratifying, as it is fully supported by the level design, capable of bringing vast and complex settings to the screen, full of verticalization and secondary paths. However, even the best of planning can turn out to be inaccurate, the situation getting complicated following an imprudence, and here the gameplay reveals itself capable of changing abruptly and without interruption, also supporting excited shootings based on heavy weapons and fixed positions, with the same credibility. Nanosuit 3.0 Although it has remained apparently unchanged from that of the second chapter, the Nanosuit of Crysis 3 presents some interesting innovations. The most obvious is related to mobility, and is represented by the running shot, which now no longer consumes the shared energy, presenting itself similar to that offered by many other shooters on the market, although it offers much more speed. Although you can therefore shoot more easily and more often, the energy consumption of the armor and invisibility powers drastically increases if you start running, appropriately limiting their abuse in combat. Superjumping, on the other hand, still requires a small amount of energy. Another interesting detail, which will emerge above all in the second half of the campaign, is the possibility of overloading the generator of the suit thanks to alien technology, obtaining improved performance for several seconds. The Nanosuit upgrade system has also been revised, not only in the way of acquiring the kits necessary to access the improvements, now no longer linked to killing the Cephs but to be recovered directly on the territory, but also in the management of the individual perks. The Crytek guys have created a system that allows you to combine up to four improvements simultaneously, and save three presets to be recalled quickly. Each perk also has a ~Maximum~ version, to be unlocked by completing small challenges connected to it (for example, to improve the power linked to the Power Kick, it will be necessary to complete a certain number of kills with it). The quantity and variety of perks is remarkable, perfect for supporting both a stealth gameplay style and a more direct one, or interesting hybrids. War on two fronts Crysis has always offered players clashes with two distinct realities. On the one hand, the human enemies, usually easier to wipe out despite their numerical superiority, on the other the aliens, much more resistant and lethal. Crysis 3 does not si naturally subtracts from this logic, continuously alternating the forces involved, sometimes superimposing them. Enemy AI, be it CELL mercenaries or Ceph aliens, has been completely rewritten, with mostly positive results. Even with invisibility always on, raising the alarm in the vast environments proves to be quite easy. The reaction of the enemies becomes interesting at this point, as they are often seen at work in an attempt to track down the player, shooting blindly in various directions, throwing EMP grenades capable of deactivating the nanosuit, and quickly scouring the environments. Notable steps forward compared to the experience lived in the previous chapter, although some stretch marks are still present. Especially in the case of excited shooting against the CELLs, it will happen several times that some opponents make themselves too easy a target, forgetting to use the covers appropriately, or get outflanked without too much effort. The story against the Cephs, on the other hand, is much more complex, as they also combine more effective weapons with circumvention routines that are sometimes very annoying. In this sense, one cannot speak of Crysis 3 as a properly difficult game, rather as a demanding experience, however one decides to experience it. The Veteran difficulty level represents, in our opinion, the starting point for any player with experience with the genre, while Super Soldier, the definitive level, puts even the expert to the test, eliminating the crosshairs on the screen and drastically increasing the effectiveness of enemy weapons. For its part, the refined and very open design of the levels adapts perfectly to the two different natures of the conflict, always contextualizing the outposts now of the CELLs, now of the aliens. Small details, but destined to be imprinted in the memory, such as the nocturnal crossing of an unrecognizable Chinatown guarded by human mercenaries in force, an escape in the tall grass by the Ceph Stalkers, very fast quadrupeds with fearsome melee attacks, and a long battle in one of the largest environments in the game, where shooting on foot alternates with the use of vehicles. The latter, incidentally, do not play a predominant role in the campaign, and their use is mostly at the discretion of the player, but the good realization of the driving model makes them an overall welcome and fun addition. The primary objectives are joined for the first time in the saga of optional secondary missions. Often these are simply additional points to reach on the map, in exchange for obtaining small bonuses in completing primary tasks or further narrative backstory. However, this is not a particularly incisive addition, although it represents a further incentive, however welcome, to explore the settings in depth. From the point of view of longevity, which has always been difficult to calculate for the titles of the saga due to the impact that different styles of play can have on it, Crysis 3 is still shorter than the previous chapter. Played Veteran, our playthrough lasted eight hours, completing all side missions but leaving out many of the intel files and some Nanosuit upgrade kits, and adopting a hybrid style of play, now stealth, now open face. This is a lower value than that recorded by Crysis 2 (which however presented a fluctuating quality of the levels, not found here), and in general not exceptional, but the density of gameplay cues and the complexity of the levels compensate in much of the relative brevity of the experience. The validity of the plot and the rapid succession of settings also help in the compensation, eliminating any ~dead time~ and leaving only a great desire to continue towards the next sandbox level. Naturally, going straight to the objectives and at a lower level of difficulty, the duration of the campaign could decrease dramatically up to five/six hours, but Crysis 3 has definitely been designed to be enjoyed in a very different way, enjoying the openness of the levels and of the many paths present in them. Furthermore, the replayability factor should not be overlooked, emphasized precisely by the size of the levels and the great freedom of approach. In this sense, however, we have felt the lack of a New Game +, that is the possibility of starting over at the last level of difficulty with the previously acquired powers already unlocked from the beginning.
