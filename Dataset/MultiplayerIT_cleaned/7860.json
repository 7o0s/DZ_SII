Followed by a substantial series of reissues that have made some changes in the stylistic and musical fields, the title was still orphaned of a real sequel, which now arrives thanks to the expert hands of the PikPok developers. The endless runner of my fantasy Even more than in the prequel, the greatest strength of Robot Unicorn Attack 2 is represented by a graphic realization that cannot fail to conquer all those who lived through the 80s or who simply have a minimal interest in the aesthetics of that period . Here, then, is that the quadruped protagonist runs leaving a rainbow trail behind him, darting over seabeds on which flying whales and islands floating in the air stand out, all while pods of dolphins joyfully jump on the lower part of the screen. In short, an authentic sci-fi delirium punctuated by a soundtrack that will not be able to count on the hit Always of the prequel, but which still does its dirty duty, even if it is a bit repetitive in the long run. Beyond the purely stylistic merits, PikPok's work is also competent from a purely technical point of view, thanks to the excellent animations of the unicorn and super detailed backdrops, marking a clear step forward compared to what was shown in the previous episode. Fortunately, the developers have not limited themselves to a mere aesthetic update (otherwise it would have been difficult to distinguish this sequel from the remixes of the prequel) but have also broadened the playful horizons of the original, while keeping its basic structure intact. So here, unlike most endless runners, the games of Robot Unicorn Attack 2 are divided into three sessions, at the end of which the scores obtained by the user are added up for what is the final score which will determine rewards and position in the global leaderboards. In terms of actual gameplay, however, the game is not exactly an innovator, considering how the goal is to get as far as possible by jumping over obstacles and crevasses and breaking through the giant crystals that block the way with a powerful goring: both of these actions are made extremely simple by a basic control system, with the mythological protagonist who runs automatically and the player who only needs to tap on one of the two sides of the screen to perform the two basic movements just described . Not being able to distort too much a play structure that was already fine as it was, the PikPok developers focused on the contours, giving Robot Unicorn Attack 2 a personality that goes beyond its particular stylistic code. To begin with, the game scenario does not change with each game, but on a daily basis, inviting the user to memorize the path during the twenty-four hours in which it remains unchanged: the same levels are then structured in a way not unlike those of Sonic, with real crossroads on the vertical axis that lead to completely different roads. Furthermore, by completing certain missions it is possible to level up and unlock bonuses of various types to maximize one's performance in subsequent sessions; moreover, the unicorn tears (sic!) collected during the races serve as currency to buy upgrades or make new content available, to tell the truth with quantities such as to require a very heavy grinding or submission to the inevitable in-app purchases. It is also possible to participate in team competitions, joining one of the two teams available and contributing to the achievement of common objectives in order to obtain special rewards. In short, PikPok has certainly not spared itself in peppering a free downloadable title with a whole series of intriguing gimmicks that stimulate the user to play at least one fleeting game a day, in fact the real winning elements of the product together with the never too praised realization graphics.", "date": "2013-05-02", "grade": "8.5"}
