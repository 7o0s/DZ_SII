{"name": "Kult - La recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kult-la-recensione.html", "text": "3D people 3DPeople didn't want to deny their name and, technically, they decided to offer us a respectable graphics engine, at least for this kind of title. Kult presents a successful mix between some elements of the pre-rendered scenarios and other three-dimensionally animated elements in real time. The isometric view is fixed and it will only be possible to change the zoom level. These compromises have allowed the developers to offer us a scenographic system with a good impact with acceptable performance even on systems that are no longer of the latest generation. There are also a certain number of choreographic effects: from the presence of atmospheric effects, to the movement of the branches of the trees blown by the wind, up to the fireballs that probably illuminate the night scenarios. On the other hand, however, the absolute static nature of the scenarios is also sadly reflected in the interaction with the backdrops. Apart from the possibility of opening a few chests every now and then, most of the time it will be impossible to even climb a ladder or even open the door of a house. the absolute static nature of the scenarios is also sadly reflected in the interaction with the backdrops 3D people The playing area is organized in a similar way to the two Baldur's Gates: from the main map it will be possible to move to any of the important areas. Areas will appear as the game progresses, ensuring programmers the possibility of controlling the linear evolution of the game and giving the player the possibility to choose the order of resolution of some missions. It should be emphasized that the loading of the locations are very long, not to say unnerving. From the sound point of view, the title does not offer particular ideas, beyond the uninspired and rather monotonous soundtrack, we point out environmental sound effects but still quite normal. Kult creates fashion Kult is an essential but not simplistic title. And this is noticeable from the moment you create your own character. Forget the choice of race, gender or canonical class. All you can select are the hairstyle and clothing of our inquisitor, setting the statistics, choosing the initial attunements and obviously the name of your alter ego A glimpse into the game world The statistics on the basis of which to set our style of play are four: Melee, Distance, Magic and Speed. Melee determines the chances of damage and parrying in close hand-to-hand combat; Range affects accuracy and damage done with ranged weapons (such as bows); Magic, of course, will determine the effectiveness of our magical attacks while Speed will indicate the speed of shooting and the chances of dodging opponents' blows. The total absence of non-combat oriented stats is a clear symptom of the Action orientation of this cRPG. Just to distinguish itself from the other titles, in Kult the primary statistics are not represented in numerical bases but, somewhat as happens in some schools, by an alphabetical mark: therefore we start from F-, passing through F, E- to get up to to excellence which is represented by an A. Italian cults Kult has been translated into Italian as regards the manual (rather poor to tell the truth) and texts. For the more English-speaking, during the installation phase it will still be possible to decide to install the title with the texts in English. The localization quality is good but not free from even sporadic uncertainties. Overall, another plus point for this game. Matter of feeling A large part of the gaming experience revolves around the concept of Tuning. The Attunements represent additional abilities that our character will be able to learn by entering into harmony - precisely - with certain special objects. To be able to fully understand how to master a certain Attunement we would be forced at best to wear a particular type of amulet, in the worst case, for example, to wield a type of weapon that is not very congenial to us for all the time necessary to learn the Attunement . In a nutshell: each successful hit will make us increase the percentage of progress necessary to unlock the Tuning. Once in possession of a Tune, we will be able to use it at any time simply by using a particular type of artifact aligned to the basic element of Tune (water, air, earth or fire) and wearing a certain type of armor. This system - certainly much easier to use than to explain, ensures Kult a rather strategic and varied management of the fights. In fact, during the game we will have to decide whether to always use the equipment we preferito or whether perhaps to make use of less powerful weapons or armor but able to make us unlock particularly useful or important attunements. In order to use the typical attunements of thieves, for example, we will be forced to wear only light leather armor or to use throwing weapons. The most powerful spells, on the other hand, force us to fight without any armour, and so on... It is interesting to note that the concept of Mana or Magic Points is completely absent for the use of spells. Most Attunements will always be active and will work in the background (like those that improve the attack or defense factor, decrease the damage dealt and so on) while the purely attack ones, like spells, have a certain period waiting before you can use them again. Obviously the more powerful they are, the longer the reload time will be. Depending on the reference element, the attack spells resolve, for example, in a meteor shower (earth) or fire (guess what?). The maximum number of tunes that can be used simultaneously will be determined by the experience level of our character, the combination of the chosen tunes cannot be determined at all times, but only before resting. Another particular feature introduced in Kult by the designers is that of the presence of the World of Dreams. The Dream World is an alternative plane of existence, a shadow realm composed of the immortal essence of the Dead God, which can only be accessed by magicians and some particular dark and powerful beings. At any moment of the game it will be possible to take refuge in the Dream World thanks to the pressure of a simple button. Visiting this particular plane of existence will sometimes be necessary in order to solve particular quests or to talk to certain NPCs (for example when they are dead) but also to collect additional experience points or to collect essences, released upon the death of each dark creature. which will be useful to speed up the learning of the Tunings. Heretic fights Strangely, speaking of a cRPG Action, Kult's fights are not the best component of the whole game. On the contrary. Especially at the beginning, when a wolf bite will be enough to kill you, the fights are frustrating and result in a continuous flight to distance yourself from the group of enemies, shoot them from a distance and then start running away again to avoid the shots of the enemies. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is absent and is limited to keeping an opponent at a distance if he is equipped with a throwing weapon or sending him into disarray in your direction if he has a melee weapon. Furthermore, the control system is often imprecise and, in moments of greater excitement, cumbersome. You move with the left mouse button and attack with the right, holding down the left button our character will move in the direction of the cursor, holding down the right one will continue to attack any enemy indicated by the mouse arrow. Unfortunately, the precision of the pointing sometimes seemed critical to us, as well as the delay in the response. In fact, it may happen that you release the left mouse button but do not see the character stop immediately, creating small but still annoying problems, especially in the most delicate moments. Speaking of fights, we couldn't help but describe the damage and healing management which, like other components of the game, is rather atypical. Our character has two health-related values: Hit Points and Blood Points. These, after each rest, will turn out to be at the same level, but while the Hit Points decrease as the character receives damage in combat and can be recovered freely every time we use medicines, the Blood Points represent the maximum number that the Hit points and decrease each time we heal. In a nutshell: we can heal ourselves as many times as we want, but each time we do it we will have fewer and fewer Hit Points available. The implications are evident and give the clashes an additional tactical nuance. Heretical missions Equally strangely, Kult's questing system turns out to be varied, complete and also quite ~deep~. Certain quests can only be solved through the use of certain objects, others - albeit rarely - will have more than one interpretation and will put us in front of a sort of moral dilemma that will not be limited to a sterile yes / no or good choice / bad but which, instead, will put us in front of ethical doubts that are difficult to resolve. All this, supported by well-written dialogues, full of irony (also thanks to the contribution of the same person behind the script of the old graphic adventure Discworld Noir) and able to never let the player get bored. well-written dialogues, full of irony, able to never make the player bored Heretical missions The disillusioned protagonist of the game herself, from the top of her self-centeredness and far from wanting to wear the figure of the pious, spotless and fearless hero, lends herself well to the development of an interesting plot and with alternative endings (six). Thus, between one massacre and another, you will find the time - among other things - to buy a house, to look for work for a one-armed zombie or to constantly complain because everyone thanks you but no one rewards you. We are certainly faced with a title where most situations will be resolved with a ~go and kill everyone~, however the rhythm will also be broken by rather unusual game situations for an action-oriented game. The only discordant note, in what otherwise would have been a sure summer hit, is the fact that the resolution of certain missions is often unclear and that, even once you have arrived at an apparent solution to the problem, you remain inexplicably blocked without any additional clues. Quite frustrating. Comment Pseudo-three-dimensional isometric view, real-time combat, game philosophy oriented towards immediacy and action: with these premises it was all too easy to talk about yet another clone of the much-played (and hated) Diablo series by Blizzard. Instead, a few hours of play are enough to understand that Kult is closest to the gaming experiences offered by titles such as Divine Divinity. And there are also intuitions and innovations worthy of particular attention. Taken for what it is, that is a title without too many proclamations and promises, ~Kult: Heretic Kingdoms~ is an enjoyable title full of welcome surprises. Unfortunately, the innovative system of rules based on the concept of Syntonie, the always sparkling and never banal dialogues, the interesting story surround a game with a rather wooden combat system and some limping and unclear quests. Otherwise we would have found ourselves in front of an excellent title, for now it remains ~only~ a good game, however able to offer hours of entertainment to all fans of this genre of games. If you are in a cRPG withdrawal crisis, even the most demanding players will be able to find excellent ideas from this title. And if your mouse has survived the Sacred experience, and you are looking for a much deeper but equally simple and immediate title, then Kult could just be right for you. Pros: Pleasant graphics Plot and well-finished dialogues Noteworthy innovations and ideas Cons: During the fights the control method is not always optimal and the AI of the enemies is very poor Interaction with the game world close to zero Inexplicably long uploads Alita is a young inquisitor, greedy for glory and power, she is not used to scruples and does not hide that she always expects something in return for the favors and services offered to other people. Alita is you. The heretical kingdoms mentioned in the subtitle of the game name are the lands where your adventures will take place. Returning from the bloodthirsty reign of Theocracy, religion can no longer threaten the peace of the Heretic Realms. Precisely for this reason the Inquisition fights to fight and prevent the birth of any minimal form of religion, yet the theft of a sword, the Godslayer, threatens to endanger the balance of the whole domain. Alita has been commissioned by her master - the high inquisitor Lord Valkarin - to find the exterminating sword of the Gods and then destroy it: will she be able to resist the ~dark side of the force~? These are the assumptions of ~Kult: Heretic Kingdoms~, an RPG from the East which, while not hiding its distinctly Action personality, will not fail to offer some nice surprises even to the more calm and thoughtful players.", "date": "2004-12-10", "grade": null}
