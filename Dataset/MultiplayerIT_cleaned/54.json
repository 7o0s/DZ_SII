{"name": "Mario Bros - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-bros-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday Developed by Nintendo in 1983 and ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, Mario Bros is the first game in which Mario appears as the real protagonist. Unlike the more celebrated Super Mario Bros, Mario Bros particularly shines when played with two players. On a fixed screen, populated by enemies such as crabs and turtles and at times crossed by deadly obstacles such as rotating fireballs, the tactic does not yet involve head jumping: Mario must hit the platform below the enemies, knocking them out and, only then, eliminating them walking on it. Not being able to hit enemies directly on the head, as would have been possible starting from Super Mario Bros, the player is constantly forced to avoid them along the platforms, a task that is soon demanding and which generates many comical stress situations. To complicate things, precious bonus coins are placed among the enemies (the points, in a classic game, are important: they give extra lives) and a power block with limited use, capable of dazing enemies but also of awakening those already in trouble. If all this already works very well for a single player, busy with the few but difficult levels offered by the game (with an excellent and diabolical difficulty curve), Mario Bros is actually a multiplayer killer application. The fame of Mario Bros is due to this, and certainly not to its attractiveness as a single player game, as well as its continuous recycling by Nintendo: starting from the bonus game of Super Mario Bros 3 for the NES up to the inclusion of the game in the recent Super Mario Advance re-releases on the GBA. The minimal device of Mario Bros, almost a puzzle as well as a platformer, continues to work perfectly. What is it today That Mario Bros is particularly aged from a technological point of view is all too obvious. The numerous re-editions of the game, graphically updated from time to time, make the original graphic proposal appear even more obsolete, which is preparing to soon reach the honorable goal of the quarter of a century by letting itself be played. But it's not just Mario's appearance that arouses amazement in those who can only experience Mario Bros today, the same feeling that anyone who looks at a 1930s Mickey Mouse today has. Even Mario's movements, compared to his contemporary agility, appear woody, deliberately oppressed by a strong inertia that is up to the player's ability to control and limit. Mario Bros is a game of yesteryear, different from those of today. But it remains a simple and deadly challenge mechanism. In multiplayer, the game puts no barriers between collaboration and competition, leaving mutual disturbance on the same level as sabotage, at the discretion of the players. The narrowness of the spaces and the fact that the characters can go against each other or try to collaborate but not be equally well coordinated generates infinite chases, pernicious impacts, sabotage and various conflicts, for one of the simplest and most tested multiplayer in history. Mario Bros is a game really far from today's paradigms, all to be rediscovered despite the scant consideration of entire generations of reviewers, ready to dismiss it as a mere ~extra~ of other packs. Provided, of course, you know how to ask him for nothing other than a small, ingenious multiplayer challenge mechanism, as repetitive as it is intoxicating. Mario Bros proves itself, for those who love two-player challenges, as a small, big purchase, as a game immune to obsolescence, provided you consider the challenge with the WiiMote worthy of 500 Wii Points and don't find yourself already, perhaps inadvertently, as an extra to some other game for your console. Mario Bros, a singular fixed-screen platformer with a strong multiplayer vocation, is the title that baptizes the brothers Mario and Luigi. The first of the two, who had begun his career under the name of Jumpman in Donkey Kong, would have far surpassed the role of mascot of a videogame company: he would have become a true icon, a symbol of the practice of videogames tout court. Not everyone remembers this debut, due to the much more famous Super Mario Bros. Relatively little known as a stand-alone title, Mario Bros is in fact much better known for its numerous re-editions, as extra multiplayer, of Nintendo games from the years to come . In evaluating Mario Bros on Wii, therefore, it is precisely on the relationship between the immortality of the multiplayer mode (here at the price of 500 Wii Points) and the systematic, previous recycling of the game by Nintendo that the balance needs to swing.", "date": "2007-03-05", "grade": null}
