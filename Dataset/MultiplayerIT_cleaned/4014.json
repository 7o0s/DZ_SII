There is always some element that suggests the ~cash grab~, the production set up with the thought of easy money, but at least there is a certain study in the construction of the video game, which goes beyond the simple pastime without depth from a tap on the touch screen and go. An example of this renewed commitment comes from Dragon Ball Legends, a game not without flaws but which demonstrates the will to go beyond the simple exploitation of a brand that sells itself, applied for once also in the mobile sector to a certain substrate playful at least reasoned. This Tokyo Ghoul:re birth somehow resembles the game based on the Toriyama series, if only for the exploitation of what seems to be a sort of interface common to both titles, a kind of template that evidently Bandai Namco has decided to use for more than one mobile production. It is not exactly a pleasant presentation, to be honest, with the typical information chaos that often derives from the interfaces developed by Japanese teams for touch screen devices and which does not make immersion in the game world easy, also given the characteristic facet of the its structure. It is in fact an RPG that could belong to the JRPG, except for the hybridization of strategic characteristics and the obvious gacha-style collecting drifts, which is now almost mandatory to expect in productions of this kind. Obviously, the story and characters are taken from the Tokyo Ghoul series, to whose fans it is dedicated almost exclusively, perhaps the only ones who can fully appreciate its somewhat repetitive mechanics by virtue of the desire to experience the adventures of their favorites firsthand. JRPG, strategic and gacha Knowledge of the Tokyo Ghoul series is an almost essential prerequisite to be able to appreciate this game: not so much to understand the story, given that the main mode retraces it in broad terms providing a good smattering about it, but rather for the driving force represented by passion for this particular world and for the large cast that populates it in animating the collecting spirit that is the basis of the RPG and gacha dynamics. The combat system substantially follows that seen in other similar titles, such as for example in Brave Summoner, thus adapting to what now seems to be the standard for this genre in mobile declination: a party of six characters lines up in battle (three in first line plus three others as support, which can be recalled at any time in place of the main fighter) and you tap on the icons to perform attacks and special abilities according to a turn-based dynamic. For each round it is allowed to perform a certain number of attacks, with the possibility of chaining them together to put together more or less powerful combos, with variable effects also based on the typical principle of ~rock, paper, scissors~ which regulates the strength between the characters, each endowed with a different elemental power. The clashes are very fast and spectacular, also thanks to the use of 3D cel shading mixed with some 2D animated scenes that perfectly manage to recreate the anime atmosphere in the fury of the battle, but the strategic depth is rather zeroed by the lack of actions that it is possible to carry out, in addition to the general similarity between the fighting styles and the skills of the (albeit very many) characters of the cast. The battle remains a pleasure to watch and is also particularly suitable for mobile use thanks to the control system based on quick touches, but we are quite far from certain technicalities of the classic JRPG tradition. Of much different thickness, as often happens in this type of game, is instead the management of the party, with numerous possibilities for evolution and unlocking of many skills, considering that we are dealing with over 100 characters from the series. The inevitable ~evocation~ fits into this area, i.e. the possibility of buying new characters using gems as in-game currency (which can also be purchased by spending real money) with a dynamic similar to that of prize boxes, which has now become extremely common in titles mobile as taught by the famous Fire Emblem Heroes. As in Brave Summoner and other similar titles, here too we are dealing with a plethora of game modes between single and multiplayer which however reproduce more or less the same basic situation, i.e. prog clashesresistive against three waves of enemies until the final boss. A distinctive element is represented here by the Territory Battles, or battles between players divided into hunters and ghouls for the control of the Tokyo territories, which acquire a certain strategic depth thanks to the application of ~tactics~, or bonuses and additional effects to be activated in advance , capable of changing the outcome of the clashes. The game is all in English and to tell the truth, during our test it ran into numerous blocks, remaining stationary indefinitely during the loading (rather long and frequent, however) at the end of some missions and often forcing us to exit the software and re-enter for unlock the situation. Not having seen particular similar complaints from the many users who have already left their feedback, we think that it is a specific problem of our test configuration (Samsung Galaxy S8 with Android 8.0).", "date": "2018-10-12", "grade": "6.8"}
