{"name": "Yakuza 0 per Xbox One", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-0-per-xbox-one-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Yakuza 0 for Xbox One represents an event of great importance: it is an absolute debut for the SEGA series on the Microsoft console, after several years of exclusive presence on PlayStation and the recent opening to the PC world. A partnership that begins, however in the best way, given the quality of this fascinating prequel set between Tokyo and Osaka at the end of the 80s, which kicked off the renewed narrative progression of the franchise, which began precisely with this chapter and continued in the two subsequent remakes, Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2, also coming soon to Xbox Game Pass. Story and characters The events of Yakuza 0 take place between the end of 1988 and the beginning of 1989, in two different cities and with two different protagonists: on the one hand Kazuma Kiryu, a young Yakuza of the Dojima family who moves in the fictitious district of Kamurocho, on Tokyo; on the other Goro Majima, expelled from the Tojo Clan and appointed to manage a cabaret club in Sotenbori, in Osaka, but waiting for an opportunity to re-enter the ranks. The story begins with Kazuma, just twenty years old but already a star nascent of the clan, determined and very strong, inseparable from childhood friend Akira Nishikiyama. After collecting money on behalf of a loan shark, the boy discovers that the man he hit to recover the money has been found dead, and so he is forced to explain what happened to his superiors, ending up being expelled from the organization. However, there is someone pulling the strings of this disturbing plan, which has to do with the small plot of land where the beating took place, and Kazuma absolutely wants to find out who it is. To do so, however, he will have to make his way through increasingly stronger opponents, using three different fighting styles that he will have the opportunity to learn during an exciting campaign, characterized by an engaging plot full of twists and turns, narrated in a masterful way. Goro Majima is introduced after a few chapters and immediately steals the show: he is a very particular character, with a dark past, who suddenly finds himself having to deal with a defenseless person and does not hold back, even if it means facing himself family and its most powerful representatives. Like Kazuma, Goro will also learn three different fighting techniques during the campaign, each with its own combos, spectacular finishers and a separate upgrade system. Environment and gameplay As mentioned above, Yakuza 0 will take us to visit two different Japanese cities, or rather two fictitious districts: Kamurocho, loosely based on the red light district of Kabukicho, in Tokyo; and Sotenbori, which is based on the Dotonbori district of Osaka. Both sceneries boast an unrivaled atmosphere; especially in the evening, when the illuminated signs surround the characters while dozens and dozens of people stroll through the streets. The attention to detail is extraordinary in both settings, as well as the amount of collateral activities and subquests that we will be able to access by interacting with certain NPCs or simply proceeding straight on our way, therefore in an inevitable way. Within the map we will be able to visit the convenience stores to buy something to eat or energy drinks, sit in one of the many restaurants to taste Japanese cuisine in its various forms, enter a games room to play a game with Out Run or Space Harrier, try karaoke, bowling, darts, billiards or shogi, take two swings with a baseball bat, watch fights between scantily clad female wrestlers, race electric cars, try to win girls over on the phone or head to a video club to check out the latest softcore productions. As usual, the abundance of these activities represents a ~game within a game~ and can multiply the duration of the experience, especially if you don't get carried away to stay focused on the main missions. Which brings us to the subquests, which are also quite numerous, which in many cases explore Japanese culture more deeply by putting us in absurd situations, which are resolved by giving some right answers or by resorting to good old violence to right some wrongs. Completing secondary tasks will allow us to obtain points to exchange at shrines to obtain special upgrades. Beyond the rich outline, the structure of Yakuza 0 is very simple: from time to time we are shown where to go, and on the way from point A to point B of the map we will happen to come across hooligans, mobsters or annoying drunks eager to makeand fists. The combat system is excellent, boasting a great impact rendering and a surprising degree of variety, emphasized by the upgrades that gradually unlock new moves: flying kicks, low strikes, charged punches, extensions for combos, additional finishers and so on always within the sphere of the three different styles that can be activated instantly, and which present strengths and weaknesses depending on the context. This system, so solid and well-tested, that we find in its purest and smoothest version of an old-generation save system, which requires manual memorization of progress at a telephone booth), will keep us company for quite some time: even going straight on, the Yakuza 0 campaign will last you no less than thirty hours, well exceeding one hundred hours if you want to dedicate yourself to all the subquests and all the hidden secrets of the game. Xbox One goals There are fifty-five Achievements available in Yakuza 0 for Xbox One, and almost all of them revolve around the side activities of the game. Becoming competitive in the management of cabarets or in the purchase of real estate, completing a certain number of subquests, obtaining certain skills and trying all the minigames allow you to unlock most of the achievements, while the hidden ones are more traditional and are obtained by complete the various chapters of the campaign. The Xbox One version Although born as a cross-gen production for PS3 and PS4, Yakuza 0 can count on high quality assets in terms of faces, character skins, clothing and materials that can be seen around Kamurocho and Sotenbori. During the day the settings lose their charm also due to a very flat lighting system, but in the evening the atmosphere is king and it is also possible to appreciate a valuable screen space reflection in the puddles, which reflect the many illuminated signs that adorn the streets .The Xbox One version suffers from some loading that takes a little too long, especially in the very early stages of the campaign, and from some small uncertainty of a frame rate which however aims at 60 fps and maintains them without major problems, showing how it is possible to combine detail , visual quality and fluidity in one exciting solution. It's unclear at what resolution the game runs on the base console, but no artifacts or blurring are noticeable, a sign that in any case the best possible compromise has been reached.", "date": "2020-03-01", "grade": "8.8"}
