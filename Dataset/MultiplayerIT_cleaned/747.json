{"name": "Alchemy Emporium", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alchemy-emporium-recensione.html", "text": "Looking for an assistant for his shop, a powerful alchemist goes to an orphanage that welcomes creatures of all kinds. Unfortunately for him there are no imp puppies and he is forced to fall back on a little girl, who he reluctantly leads into his shop. After making her grow with potions, much faster than biology allows, and after having educated her on the basics of the trade, he entrusts her with his business to carry out an important experiment in his laboratory. After some time, since there was no more news of the alchemist, the assistant decides to go looking for him, but only finds his clothes on the ground. Suspected of having killed him by the local population, our escapes and decides to found a new business in some remote village, starting her own business to exploit all the knowledge obtained by working with the alchemist. This is the premise that gives rise to Alchemy Emporium, the review of which was distilled in finely crafted ampoules, with ingredients purchased from disreputable types. Game mechanics The title of Curtel Games and Xteam software solutions uses alchemy as a pretext to stage an economic system in which what matters to win is the increase in production and its constant improvement. After selecting the village in which you want to start the activity, which offers a more or less high challenge depending on the number of inhabitants, the visitors, the merchants who reach it (they are used to supply us with ingredients) and other factors such as the climate or position, you have to choose an alchemical order (to get bonuses) and then a partner (other bonuses). Having distributed the fifteen points available among the various skills of the alchemist (for example negotiation, to pay less for the ingredients, or tasting, which is used to determine the characteristics of the potions), on a real character sheet, one finally enters in the shop, where you can start working seriously (maybe after the tutorial). Alchemy Emporium's interface is quite spartan, but functional. The main screen of the shop is essentially a calendar on which to distribute the activities to be carried out. At the beginning you can only work from morning to night, in three shifts, but as you become more skilled you will be able to work at night as well. Of course the goal is to increase production. What else? Among the activities to be carried out to make the shop go well, it is necessary to buy ingredients, mix the potions, taste them to determine their toxicity and characteristics, package them to make them more attractive for sale, then manage the shop, sell the products, train the staff to improve its performance and more. During each slot of the day it is possible to carry out only one activity, perhaps with the help of an assistant. The latter must be hired first and can only deal with certain tasks, for a limited number of times a week. When you are satisfied with the planning, you can save it in one of the presets, so that it can also be recalled in the following weeks without having to redo everything from scratch. Each activity has its own screen in which to perform specific actions. For example, the purchase of ingredients requires you to select the merchants from whom to buy the goods, then choose what to bring to the shop; or in the tasting screen you will have to select the characteristic slot to discover, then taste it (hoping that the potions are not too toxic). Customers looking for miracles (you can also choose whether or not to get a receipt) The most interesting phase is that of creating potions, in which you are free to experiment to create increasingly effective and less harmful concoctions (the mixtures are procedurally generated at the beginning of the game, so they are always to be discovered). In general, each action to be performed is extremely intuitive, or is well explained by the contextual tutorial. Be that as it may, over time the shop owner will accumulate more and more knowledge (by reading some tomes in the library) and experience, thus managing to create better potions and attract more wealthy customers. In addition, she will become even more shrewd in conducting business, even going so far as to exploit the services of some bad guys to get in the way of competitors (who will do the same with her). Final considerations Potions for all tastes The best part of Alchemy Emporium is precisely this: each activity has its own development linked to the characteristics of the alchemist, with different levels of depth that unfold as you progress through the game. There is also variety, since the quests and events are generated randomlyentity, making each game different from the previous one, while keeping the basic mechanics unchanged. In short, the incentives to play and replay are there and if you let yourself be captured by the formula it is likely that you will end up spending many hours making and selling potions, trying not to fail in the meantime. The economic simulation of Alchemy Emporium seemed to us quite balanced: it is not ultra-punitive, but requires a certain care in the management of funds, especially in times of scarcity. On a technical level, the title of Curtel Games and Xteam software solutions, which incidentally are two Italian software houses, is decidedly successful, although it is not a large production. The graphic style of the animated phases is well characterized and, even if there is nothing that makes you cry out for a miracle, you never get the feeling of being faced with an inadequate title. Too bad for some not so beautiful UI elements, like some big buttons that are a bit of an eyesore. The many quotations in the title deserve a separate note, including The Office and Isaac Asimov.", "date": "2021-05-26", "grade": "8.0"}
