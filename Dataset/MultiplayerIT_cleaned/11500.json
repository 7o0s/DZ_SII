{"name": "Rustler", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rustler-recensione.html", "text": "We have already talked about Rustler several times. First by telling you the initial impressions of a very backward version, mainly dedicated to the backers of the project on Kickstarter. We then revisited the work earlier this year, with the release of the Early Access version. After a further six months Rustler arrives at its final version, attempting the coup and also launching itself into the console scene. We had the opportunity to review Rustler in its 1.0 version, confirming the strengths and weaknesses of what we have seen in the past, but smiling at some small but important last-minute tricks. This review is therefore almost a formality: you have read much of what needed to be said over the months. Now is the time to sum up. Conquering the Middle Ages Rustler: the ring to test yourself Anyone who has followed the all-made-in-Poland project knows well how Rustler (also known as Grand Theft Horse) wants to be a heartfelt tribute to the origins of the GTA series. Bird's eye view, little attention to good manners and immediacy to no end. The formula worked from day one, managing to grab a decent nest egg on Kickstarter and giving rise to a swarm of enthusiasts not to laugh at. Guy's story is one that recalls the dawn of the underworld, the one that was born in the poor alleys of suburban towns and then hopes to make its way into the neighborhoods that matter. Now take this basic concept and turn it into a Monty Python film set in the Middle Ages and starring a bald boy and his desire to become someone with punches and favors to the Inquisition. Rustler is exactly this: a concentrate of no-sense able to always remain faithful to its essence, managing to insert social, religious criticism and a pinch of bildungsroman into the equation. However, you must not think that you are facing a narrative masterpiece that will remain in the annals, on the other hand it is not what it tries to do, but in the course of the scarce ten hours that you will need to conclude the adventure you will have many laughs, accompanied in a genuine way by a few moments of reflection on our society and its hypocrisies. The gameplay is still him, but refined Rustler - wandering around the game world During our tests we have told you on several occasions how Rustler worked in the idea and in a large part of the realization, but was still lacking in attention to detail. Following the release in early access the team has not sat on its laurels, but on the contrary has continued to churn out updates following tight roadmaps that have brought the game to version 1.0. This is not a perfect and flawless work, but some of the problems encountered last February - when the game was already almost complete in terms of content - have at least been filed. For those who have no idea what we're talking about, Rustler is a small open world action with a top view in which to carry out different missions from time to time, being able to intersperse the action with secondary activities and pure and simple ~juggling~. The term, which became famous thanks to GTA, represents the sum of Rustler's will, around which the entire game world was built. Although the map is far from gigantic, divided between a handful of city villages and a lot of medieval countryside, there is no shortage of activities. In addition to completing the main missions that carry the story forward, it is also possible to commit minor crimes, help characters with dubious aesthetic and oratorical taste, as well as engage in group fisticuffs, horse racing - to be run in first person, not by betting - or to make a clean living dealing with the recovery of corpses. Anyone who knows the substance of any open world, but above all of what the first unforgettable chapters of GTA were, knows what we are talking about. To carry on our criminal climb we will have at our disposal a multitude of weapons and also a good amount of skills. Precisely among the latter there are some additions compared to the past, now being able to count on a series of skills that allow health regeneration, as well as others that guarantee discounts to shops or the possibility of recalling a horse anywhere.Still talking about additions and finishing touches, the guys on the team have seen fit to also encourage those who have already completed the main campaign, adding a narrative arc dedicated to Guy's father, as well as a series of new side quests featuring a witch and an aspiring rapper - the latter totally off head. To make happy goodsome of the players then thought about the introduction of the purchase of houses. By spending a few thousand gold coins it is therefore now possible to buy a handful of houses around the whole map, each with a series of advantages and objects that can be recovered nearby, as well as transforming each into a new save point. Also added fast travel by land and by sea, which can also be used during certain missions, shortening the movements which, in any case, certainly cannot be considered prohibitive given the size of the game world. Rustler: You always start in the slums In addition to all these more or less significant additions, the team has seen fit to balance the experience a bit, adding enemies, increasing and decreasing damage and resistance of some of them, both in the open world and in specific missions, even up to get to the element that most gave us a smile. In the past we had pointed out how the frustration of some poorly balanced missions in terms of difficulty and duration became unbearable due to the lack of checkpoints. Finally the game saves at more or less regular intervals, once some specific acts of each mission have been completed. Although not always managed in the best possible way, we can only applaud an addition that completely changes the face of some otherwise tedious moments. This aspect does not improve a combat system far from excellence, which sometimes really leads to exhaustion, but it is certainly an incentive to try again, giving the benefit of the doubt to a production that is still small and full of soul. Technicalities Rustler: Watch out for sirens! We conclude with what concerns the technical sector. Rustler has never shone from this point of view, suffering from a certain amount of tearing, a practically useless v-sync and an unjustified heaviness, incomprehensible by observing what the engine moves on the screen. By the same admission of the main team, some of these problems have been solved thanks to those who worked on the console portings, managing to refine some aspects of the code that had evidently remained rough. Actually now the game runs like a beauty, with practically non-existent uploads, a v-sync that really works and a general cleaning of the image that is certainly improved. the crazy world of Rustler and its inhabitants. Listening to hip hop that tells the story of the Middle Ages, being chased by a bard who ironically declaims our deeds, as well as killing and being killed is even more fun and irreverent, exactly what Rustler must and wants to be.", "date": "2021-08-31", "grade": "7.8"}
