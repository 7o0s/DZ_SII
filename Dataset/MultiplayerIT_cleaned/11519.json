{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-2008-recensione_a.html", "text": "When tradition is a guarantee But going back to the subject of this review, and therefore to the game analysed, how is the portable version of PES 2008? Simply said: as you will be able to read in the following lines, it is conceptually and technically very similar to the 2007 chapter and this, at a time when for PES the term ~renewal~ rhymes with ~ruin~ is certainly a good thing. In fact, once you take the field, you finally feel ~at home~ again. Immediately after kicking off, the feeling of familiarity is immediate and the playability of PES 2008 returns to what the series has accustomed us to for years. Passes, shots, articulated actions, everything takes place without that excessive speed (of course, a slight increase of the same compared to the most beautiful past chapters on PSX and PS2 of the saga there is) which characterized the next-gen home editions. The physics of the sphere has remained more or less unchanged and the contrasts themselves are the credible ones we know. If anything, an interesting novelty is the better calibration of some controls, such as those linked to the analog which is now more precise in its functions, and a further upward increase in the AI of companions and opponents who apply themselves much better in the execution of schemes, at least on the maximum difficulty level. The same absence of two of the four back buttons instead present on the PS2 pad, on the PSP has not prevented Konami from equally implementing the games and the typical functions of the same, improving them, even if in this case it is necessary to perform some key combinations. Few but good As we have seen, therefore, there are no striking innovations compared to PES 6 (of 2007), but tweaks scattered here and there. Therefore the game modes themselves have remained the same: Cups (Konami Cup, International, etc), World Tour (present only in the PS2 version, and which allows the user to face, with his own team, challenges all over the world against every type of team), Championship, Friendly, Training and the always interesting Master League, which following the trend inaugurated last year, continues to improve the management component of the chosen club, taking into account the reaction of the fans and the appeal aroused towards of players to buy. The option that makes it possible to transfer data and information relating to the ML between the PSP and PlayStation 2 versions is interesting. Unfortunately, there is no online multiplayer, perhaps the only real flaw of the game, while there is wireless multiplayer between two players. As far as licenses are concerned, we are always at the usual: absent the Bundesliga, absent the Premier except for a couple of clubs with official logos (but Manchester United is now missing among these) as always we will have to arm ourselves with a lot of patience and edit shirts and names with the usual, very complete internal editor of the game. However, year after year one wonders why Konami does not acquire the licenses for the aforementioned tournaments once and for all. Even the rosters leave something to be desired: the ~updates~ are absent and therefore players like Adriano will still be at Inter and Sissoko at Liverpool. Speaking of the athletes, it must be said that graphically their look appears more real than the previous edition of the title, both in terms of textures, much closer to those of PS2 than in the past, and in the polygonal models, proportions and animations. The same stadiums, very few (two) now appear more credible while the turf should in our opinion be slightly recalibrated in the colors. As far as the audio sector is concerned, commentary is almost absent except in rare cases such as during goals, but for the majority of fans of the series this is a good thing, given the hatred and annoyance for Civoli's comment, while the choirs are certainly not engaging ones already heard on other platforms. Comment As we have had the opportunity to repeat several times both in the respective reviews for PS3 and Xbox 360, and in this one, in an attempt to propose a new graphics engine and a new AI on next-gen platforms, Konami ended up distorting his saga, paying due to the lack of preparation in designing and working on cross-platform and HD products. On the PSP instead, the Japanese softo has worked on the safe side, on a more congenial terrain because it is known, also due to the hardware limitations of the Sony laptop compared obviously to the potential of the more powerful home machines. And this was a good thing, because limiting oneself, so to speak, to smoothing out part of the defects of the previous edition and adding some novelties, in fact the quality of a very valid product was kept unchanged, which in any case needs updating and new ideas (and in this sense we refer you to vvery high Wii version) to go back to seeing ratings as high as those of a few chapters ago. Pros: High gameplay Improved graphics Ability to transfer Master League data from PSP to PS2 Cons: Roster not updated in January and lack of many licenses Absence of an online mode A few more options would have been nice Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 is available for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, PC, PSP, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for PSP. For years it has been the video game series that symbolizes the sport most loved by Europeans, South Americans and Asians, and even in 2008, despite everything, it was at the top of the sales charts in half of Europe with its latest ~episode~. Yet things have not gone as well as the data just mentioned would suggest. Something unexpected happened. This year, in fact, we witnessed a bit of surprise and dismay an incredible misstep made by the team led by Shingo 'Seabass' Takatsuka, who admitted that the 2008 edition of his jewel ~is really far from that we wanted. We are not used to designing and working multiplatform ~, and the disappointment for what was supposed to be the first chapter of the saga really in HD and next-generation was very strong for all fans of this ultra-decade saga. Especially considering on the other hand the good test offered by its all-time rival, EA Sports, which on PS3 and Xbox 360 has created an absolutely valuable edition of FIFA both in terms of graphics and gameplay. Luckily, at least the much-vaunted new AI called ~Team Vision~, the animations and textures have proved to be truly faithful to the promises made, even if limited by dozens of bugs and slowdowns in the framerate, so at least the KTYO team will have a solid foundation from which to start again to return to offering us a product worthy of its history.", "date": "2008-04-01", "grade": null}
