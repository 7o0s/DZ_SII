More than natural: the real litmus test is always the second success, and we believe that the developers are also well aware of this; however, this does not mean that all the energies of the software house must necessarily be channeled into a new video game when one's eldest son still has a lot to say. The choice was therefore to develop a cheerful expansion for Mario + Rabbids called Donkey Kong Adventure, which - if the title hadn't understood it - sees among the protagonists both Nintendo's most loved ape and his... counterpart white rabbit. The result? Not so mind-blowing as to give us any security for the future, but certainly a remarkable show of intent. Narrative and gameplay: monkeys, selfies, and lots of love For Donkey Kong Adventure the same principle applies to the basic Mario + Rabbids: everything, from the campaign to the gameplay, revolves around a simple story, but perfectly mixed with the absurdities of Ubisoft's rabbits and the characteristics of the historical characters of the great N. Here, in particular, everything starts from Rabbid Kong, who devastated by the defeat received by the group of heroes of the game (immortalized by various selfies) finds himself in front of the ~special~ washing machine from which it all started, and combines an inevitable mess by opening a new portal. In the general chaos, Rabbid Peach is also teleported away from the mushroom kingdom, only to find herself alone (excluding the inevitable BEEP-O) and without weapons in a ~Rabbidized~ version of the Donkey Kong world. And this is where the fun begins: in the new campaign you will not have all the heroes exploited up to that moment available, but a small group made up of Rabbid Peach, Rabbid Cranky, and that very Donkey Kong who gives the name to the dlc. However, if the ~Lapins Cretins~ are very classic in their use, the same cannot be said for the gorillone... Donkey is in fact an incredibly powerful character, around whose abilities the whole adventure revolves: not only can he move quickly around the map using specific platforms, but also take any enemy, destructible cover or elemental crate, and hurl them around the scenario as if they were balls basketball, all in addition to the normal attack, movement and secondary ability activation actions that all characters have. In short, to shuffle the cards, the guys from Ubisoft Milan have concentrated the new mechanics in a single character, and built almost every mission around a team led by him. A smart move, which not only didn't force them to turn the system inside out, but allowed them to shape even more original and unpredictable battlefields than those seen in the original game. Structure: password ~movement~ Not much to say: once again the Ubisoft designers have shown their muscles, and we are talking about biceps not too far from the gigantic ones our ape-like protagonist has. The few new enemies in the game are in fact extremely mobile, forcing the player to calculate movements with the leader and the other team members perfectly (Kong can catch and throw them too, repositioning them properly) and to make the most of the new abilities . Cranky himself, then, is equipped with an equivalent of Peach's shotgun and a special landing after team jumps that damages and freezes enemies - usable twice thanks to Donkey's launches - as proof of the team's will to merging old and new mechanics to deliver a fresh experience. And it is, let's be clear: most of the game's missions are very good and the adventure flows beautifully; only that we are not dealing with a product completely devoid of weaknesses. Ultimately, in fact, the Mario + Rabbids skeleton does not allow for huge variations on the theme, and despite the beauty of the new mechanics we found the boss fights of the new campaign... or maps with elements to be destroyed and activated very similar to those seen in battles such as the Phantom of the Opera or, indeed, the very original Rabbid Kong. We understand how there was no way to do much more, but perhaps at least in terms of variety of enemies, more fantasy could be worked on, because - however suitable for the DLC - both the summoners and the coCollectors don't differ much from opponents already seen and seen in the classic Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle. On the other hand, the progression is excellent: faster to get married to a less long-lasting but still substantial campaign (it will take you 6/7 hours to complete the adventure, not counting the usual puzzles present between one battle and another and the extras), and perfectly calculated to support a slightly steeper but never prohibitive difficulty curve. As we have already said: at Ubisoft Milan they know what good game design is.", "date": "2018-06-28", "grade": "8.5"}
