It is immediately clear that the audience for which this new game developed by Petroglyph and published by Ubisoft is designed is quite narrow and very ~geeky~, but if you are among these players you will have maximum satisfaction. The beginning is a bit difficult to learn the rules and understand how to move around the board, but after the first missions we are willing to bet that you will never leave Panzer General: Allied Assault. Beginnings are always difficult for everyone During the first mission, set up as a tutorial, it is possible to learn all the rules needed for the right approach to the game. The board is divided into 30 squares and each battle begins with the two armies, American and German, lined up on opposite sides. During the campaign it is possible to use only the stars and stripes army while online it is also possible to manage the Nazis. Basically, to triumph in the clashes it is necessary to advance on the map, take out the enemy units and conquer the occupied territories. In all missions there are different conditions to win and you just need to fulfill one of them to go to the next level. Lovers of all the most important events of the Second World War will be satisfied by the revival of famous battles such as obviously the one on the Normandy beaches or on the Rhine river in Germany. The setting has been recreated in a very accurate way but not for this reason if you are not a deep lover of History with a capital S you will not enjoy the Ubisoft title. Xbox 360 goals Panzer General: Allied Assault offers the beauty of 200 points divided into 12 objectives. To get them all it will be necessary not only to finish all the single player missions but also to play and win many challenges in online multiplayer. Other points will be unlocked by using some special cards, such as Air ones, or by destroying a large number of enemy units in a single game. Raw and raw gameplay The points accumulated are called Prestige, for the record the entire game is completely in English, and are earned through the occupation of the territories / game sectors and the deployment of troops. The Prestiges are in turn used to be able to use the playing cards, to then place the units on the table and exploit their powers. There are cards that identify the game units, such as infantry or armored vehicles, and cards that indicate powers and abilities that can be used from time to time. The troops are described in detail and each card that identifies them is full of statistics on the attack and defense strength. The clashes between the different units as if we were actually on a battlefield are influenced by the different terrains, such as hills or swamps. Some of these game sectors, in addition to providing defensive bonuses, cannot be crossed by tracked vehicles. All players start with 10 cards in their hand, randomly chosen from their deck which can be customized before the start of the games even if the system that manages it has been studied with superficiality and does not allow you to move easily between one card and another ; having to look at all the cards owned in order to insert the new ones just unlocked is quite boring. The game phase begins with the deployment of the troops, with the possible movement and ends with the possible attack of the enemies. The combat phase is influenced not only by the support of allies, for example infantry in adjacent territories or artillery from even more distant ones, but also by the use of particular combat cards. These can influence the outcome of the fight by increasing the attack or defense statistics. In addition to the combat cards in the last round of the fight it is possible to sacrifice other cards in our possession which increase the number of attack or defense points at our disposal even if unfortunately the sacrifice is expensive since this is eliminated from the deck. To complete the attack phase, a dice roll takes care of which determines further bonuses or malus to our score. At this point either the opponent is defeated or has the opportunity to counterattack. After this description you are able to understand that the whole game moves in turns and that therefore the pace is certainly not frenetic, a feature that some users certainly love but which can bore many others. The gameplay is evidently the strong point of this new game published by Ubisoft, from point dFrom a technical point of view there is little to say, the board on which the troops move is quite simple, there are no relevant animations and the clashes between the units are absolutely not recreated. Once the units are defeated they simply disappear without any sort of effect on screen. From our point of view the graphics are more than enough to manage Panzer General Allied Assault but certainly more could have been done.", "date": "2009-11-27", "grade": "8.0"}
