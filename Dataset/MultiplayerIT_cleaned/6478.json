There are works that have the sole objective of recalling atmospheres and mechanics of the past, partly obsolete, partly simply evolved and hybridized. Timothy and the Tower of Mu review will try to underline how this game is clearly a representative of this philosophy. This is the second episode belonging to the Timothy series by Kibou Interactive, an independent studio between Italy and Japan. Unlike the previous one published by Gamera Interactive, this second chapter is published by Playism and changes genre and artistic choices. If the reference of the past was the Game Boy generation, here we move on to the connotations of NES video games, veering on the 2D action-platform genre, always maintaining a particularly high level of difficulty. The idea of developing a game of this type imposes a fundamental challenge: to make the feeling of the gameplay faithful to the original inspiration, cleaning it of all the sharp edges of the past and taking advantage of all the technical elements that current generation hardware is capable of. to offer. It is precisely in this aspect that the greatest strengths and greatest weaknesses of Timothy and the Tower of Mu lie, a game that brings into play a lot of potential, but which is not always able to apply them to the fullest. The beginning of the adventure Inside the game store Timothy and the Tower of Mu has simple and imaginative narrative premises, which develop from the previous Timothy and the Mysterious Forest. After managing to heal his grandfather with the miraculous mushroom found in the mysterious forest, the protagonist discovers that that very mushroom has been cursed by the deity who created it. One is cured of any ailment, but after a year death is a certain sentence. Timothy's grandfather thus passes away, but the protagonist in the meantime remembers that there is a tower wrapped up in a legend: ~whoever gets to the top of it will be able to make a wish~. With this sentence in mind Timothy sets off to save his grandfather, starting the journey and the game. Beyond this important premise, the narrative development of the events is limited, even if the supporting characters and game events color Timothy's journey by breaking the fast pace, while developing a rich and varied game lore. A look at the gameplay One of the levels of Timothy and the Tower of Mu The gameplay is in the style of action-platformers from the NES era. There are three basic keys that are used to jump, take a shot (even in the air) and throw a stone with a slingshot. The difficulty lies in using them with the right timing to complete the game frameworks. Each picture represents a mini level, has a save station and develops the obstacle course that the player is called to overcome. Each enemy hit reduces the number of hearts, while any environmental threat such as circular blades and dangerous spikes on the floor decrees immediate death for Timothy. This limits the impact of the cures, especially when the difficulties are given by the platform phases. All enemies come back to life when they leave the player's frame, sometimes making it difficult to even deal with already passed sections. To all this is added the mechanics of stamina and oxygen which are consumed respectively by holding on to handholds and by being underwater. Together they add an additional degree of difficulty to the already non-trivial platforming, for a challenge rate that does not hesitate to be defined as hardcore, even if sometimes in an artificial way with difficulty peaks that are difficult to appreciate. The complex management of difficulty Ready to prepare some delicacies from the Pig-Dragon Pagoda Restaurant? The situation of difficulty is unfortunately aggravated by controls that are not always reactive and by the choice to prevent certain actions while others are in progress. For example, Timothy can use the slingshot when jumping, but not when running. On the other hand, it can be triggered at any moment. This makes maneuvering in tight spaces much more angular when dealing with running enemies and in some stages against bosses. If you are not perfectly in the center of a door, the input command may not allow you to enter and some animations on descending platforms make you believe you are making repeating micro-jumps and other small shortcomings. Even after hours of playing it is difficult to have total control of Timothy. To cope with this situation there is a game design strongly linked to the experience. Once you understand the mechanics it is always easier trovary the way to solve it. This is needed to be able to continue developing both a logical experience and the right muscle memory. In boss fights, the choice of design penalizes the gaming experience, due to the one-dimensionality with which they have been reasoned and their lack of variety; the sense of fulfillment is minimal and a handful of attempts are enough to be able to overcome them. Paradoxically it's much easier to get stuck in an exploration section than when dealing with bosses. Despite the difficulty, the ten hours declared by the developers for the completion of the adventure by a ~veteran~ player seem abundant to us, above twenty we believe it is really difficult to go. Considering the price of  9.99, however, they seem balanced with the offer. A good work of art A platforming section of Timothy and the Tower of Mu Where the epigone philosophy of Timothy and the Tower of Mu emerges and manages to hit straight on the target is on the artistic front. The images on the screen manage to bring the player straight back to the very era they are committed to recalling. The climb to the Tower is visually homogeneous, but extremely well characterized by the five sub-environments that describe it. Each zone has its enemies, has its own decorations and thematic palettes, and always manages to convince the player. The fresh, yet retro pixel art taste also works very well and manages to pack Timothy and the Tower of Mu in a nice way. Equally the selection of songs is remarkable, it's a pity that there are big problems with the reproduction of tracks and many times the songs don't start, or are reproduced incorrectly with considerable annoyances during the game. The same happens with the sound effects, which however do not enjoy a comparable care in the production.", "date": "2022-08-17", "grade": "7.0"}
