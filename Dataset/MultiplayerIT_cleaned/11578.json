{"name": "Metal Slug: Commander", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-commander-recensione.html", "text": "The Chinese division of SNK has seen fit to take one of the most famous series of the Japanese development team, specifically the action shooter Metal Slug, and transform it into a gacha-style strategy game, with the traditional positions on the grid, a long campaign of missions all more or less the same and the inevitable trading cards for performing special moves. Here, the review of Metal Slug: Commander could also end here, given the huge amount of similar products already available on the App Store and Google Play store. However it is clear that such an important franchise, with its iconic protagonists, deserves further study in the hope, who knows, that maybe this time there will be some valid ideas in addition to the inevitable monetization intentions. What do you say? Gameplay Metal Slug: Commander, lanes and units in battle After completing the usual tutorial, which after dozens of strategic tutorials all more or less the same is actually quite superfluous, the gameplay of Metal Slug: Commander reveals itself exactly as we expected: two teams face each other on a battlefield, in the 'field of a fight that takes place mostly through automatic mechanisms, and in the end the one with the strongest and/or best placed units on the grid wins. The roster involved is huge and sees the presence not only of the historical protagonists of Metal Slug , i.e. the various Marco, Tarma, Sophia, Fio, Trevor, etc., but also their classic adversaries (the so-called Rebel Army) and a series of other divisions characterized by values that are more or less effective in direct confrontations according to the classic rock-scissors-paper approach. Ah, there are even some characters from the tower defense Metal Slug Attack. As mentioned above, victory is primarily the daughter of the power of the units that make up our team, thus recalling the inevitable progression with the various upgrades and microtransactions where you want to proceed more quickly and/or have come across a paywall from the point of view of the difficulty of the clashes. Secondly, it depends on the positioning of the characters on the grid, which is divided into two lanes, one upper and one lower. Managing this mechanism with a minimum of intelligence and therefore placing our fighters in the front line or in the rear according to their resistance, the type of equipment and the functioning of the special moves, which are recharged with the attacks made, can effectively allow us to defeat even stronger teams than ours on paper. However, we are speaking in any case of a rather limited degree of interaction. Structure Metal Slug: Commander includes units drawn from all episodes of the series If on the gameplay front Metal Slug: Commander is exactly as we expected it, also as regards the structure, the SNK-branded production does not introduce particular innovations, on the contrary it strictly follows the canons of the genre, including virtual currencies and those real, which are dispensed through the inevitable list of achievements. We therefore find the section dedicated to upgrades and any ~promotions~ of the characters, the one in which you can open the chests earned on the field by waiting for a certain period of time, the part of asynchronous competitive multiplayer to challenge other users' teams, special events, extra challenges and so on. Everything as expected, after all we are talking about a formula that is now very well tested in the mobile sector. Technical realization Metal Slug: Commander allows units to be placed on the grid before each engagement We then arrive at one of the most controversial aspects of the game, given that Metal Slug: Commander is limited in practice to borrowing the classic assets of the series, with its characters and related animations, and placing them within new contexts, in the specific scenarios not even very varied that form the background to the various chapters of the campaign. Most of the graphic elements are therefore recycled, with very few novelties and a minimum of freshness guaranteed by the presence of the protagonists of the aforementioned Metal Slug Attack, which as we know is a more recent title and therefore less inflated from a visual point of view. That said, the interface is reasonably clear and navigates smoothly, while the music is also borrowed here and there.", "date": "2021-08-25", "grade": "6.5"}
