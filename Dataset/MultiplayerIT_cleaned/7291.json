Zombies, a curious project by Electronic Arts and PopCap that translates the universe of one of the most iconic tower defense into a shooter. After a trip to the rainy Guildford, UK headquarters of the US distributor, we're ready to rate the experience with this production all petals and tatters, and if you've followed our coverage you already know that we are blown away by how much played. We also said it in our last preview: Garden Warfare is a title that amazes for its value, certainly not a milestone for the sector, but still far from useless. But let's go in order and let's see together what awaits us for the (approximately) 35 Euros requested on PC, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Garden Warfare entertains and convinces while preserving the peculiarities of the PopCap series Eat your veggies! The big question of this game is basically one: zombie or plant? Do you join the ranks of the greenish and combative queens of pots and gardens or do you rise from your eternal rest and start walking (awkwardly) with other undead like yourself? We all have our preferences, our tastes, but the beauty is that in Garden Warfare both teams are very well characterized and above all the classes that are offered to us are interesting from both sides, arousing the desire to try both factions. Each class has a basic attack and three special moves that can only be used at intervals of time, a factor that makes their activation pleasantly planned and that rewards the player capable of waiting for the right moment. In addition to this, with some essential similarities for balancing, each of the eight classes present in the game enjoys a personal and different gameplay from the others. Peashooter and Soldier correspond more or less to the assault classes present in other titles, armed as they are with an automatic weapon and endowed with great mobility (even vertically, which allows them to position themselves on the roofs and from there enjoy a particularly favorable). Among the plants we then have the Cactus, a sniper who however does not enjoy particularly high damage, a lack which he compensates for with the possibility of flooding the battlefield with anti-zombie mines and activating a flying garlic to be controlled in the first person; then there is the Chomper, a carnivorous plant capable of eating enemies in one fell swoop if attacked from behind and of going underground in Tremors style and then leaping out under the unfortunate case; and finally the Sunflower, the curator of the group, with poor offensive skills, but essential for the good maintenance of the plant army. The zombies are no different in terms of variety and in addition to the aforementioned Soldier they offer us the Engineer, armed with a grenade launcher and a radio-controlled helicopter; the Scientist, lethal at close range thanks to a similar shotgun and capable of activating a device to heal his companions; and the All Star, which closely resembles the Heavy from Team Fortress 2 both in size and in the gatling gun it carries. While each class plays an important role in team balance, there are a few that alone seem capable of wreaking havoc. The Chomper, for example, can halve the opposing ranks with painstaking work on the flanks, eating the zombies that venture on the perimeter of the battlefield, while the Engineer can use the splash damage of his grenade launcher to thin out small groups of enemies . The impression is that, in general, the developers have managed to maintain a certain fidelity as much as possible to the gameplay of the original titles, with the plants in a more defensive role and the zombies more skilled in attacking. This can also be seen in the funniest game mode of those proposed, Gardens & Graveyards, which asks plants to defend control points, and the undead to capture them within a time limit. The defensive capabilities of the plants are enhanced by this return to the origins, and synergies and tactics are quickly created between the players which are naturally suggested by the gameplay: the curators flank the Peashooters on the front line, the Cacti keep themselves in the rear for a painstaking work of ~sniping~, while carnivorous plants bypass the line of attack of the zombies by engaging only without fail. The defense then seems to have a particular advantage, even more if we add the possibility for the plants to activate some pots scattered around the control points, planting offensive and defensive turrets there, but this is where the Engineer comes into play, real king of this mode. Halfway between the undead spawn point and the p control pointThere are teleporters in predetermined locations that only the Engineer can activate. The winning tactic seemed to shift the focus of attention precisely towards these points, protecting the Engineer in his construction and thus creating a preferential corridor of zombies that rain down on the opponents, flanked by those controlled by the artificial intelligence that can be activated in some specific points. If everything goes smoothly, therefore, the Engineer activates teleportation and defensive turrets, transforming the attack into a real 'zerg' of the control point of the plants, which now try to divide their forces between the actual defense and the teleporter attack that can be destroyed. Oh, are you cool? If Gardens & Graveyards is the queen mode of the PopCap production, there are other bridesmaids who accompany her on her journey between flora and former humans. There is the inevitable training mode in which to shoot without worrying so much about the score, there is the team deathmatch that shifts the attention (and the balance) from the search for objectives to the hard and pure fight, but above all there is the Garden Ops cooperative mode, which is closest in concept to the original gameplay of the series. Here, four players take on the role of as many plants and prepare to defend their garden from endless waves of zombies. It starts slowly, with those that are easy to kill, in a crescendo of difficulty that in the space of about ten minutes raises the bar of the challenge to pleasantly tantalizing levels, with zombies equipped with armour, devastating attacks, mini-bosses and real super zombies to be faced as a group. The choice of classes therefore proves to be fundamental for the success of the adventure, the presence of a sunflower for example appears fundamental given his excellent skills as a curator, but it must be said that even in his absence you can always decide to plant sunflowers in the pots scattered around the map to create healing stations. The mechanism is identical to that seen in Gardens & Graveyards, with the possibility for players to cultivate pots distributed around sensitive points, planting their favorite turret-plant chosen from those in their inventory. Yes, because the usable plants (as well as the zombies that can be summoned from the undead in competitive multiplayer) are consumable items that must be recovered through the card packs that can be bought in the appropriate shop. Stop everyone, we know that when you hear about the shop, the ~freetoplayphobia~ starts immediately, but this time we can sleep peacefully since the transactions are made by spending exclusively the currency earned by playing, no real money. The sachets come in different cuts, starting from the basic ones containing only consumables up to the special ones containing objects for customization, and others necessary to unlock the sub-classes. In fact, each class has 6 special versions with particular abilities (the freezing cactus, the soldier with the most powerful machine gun and so on) which must be unlocked precisely with the pieces obtained in the sticker envelopes. From what we have tried, we can say that the amount of credits obtained with each game seemed balanced to us with the price of the envelopes: it is not that much effort to bring something home, even if clearly the most coveted envelope of all will require a good afternoon of farming . The system therefore works, unlocking objects and hilarious customizations for your characters is pleasant and satisfying, even if the inexplicable impossibility of going to make changes to the equipment between one game and another without leaving the lobby should be noted. The classic versions of the aforementioned modes complete the playful offer, in which the character upgrades cannot be used, and a two-player split screen cooperative in which to face the waves of zombies. Everything takes place in (a few) large and generally well-made maps, with many corridors, open spaces and in cover, even if the possibility for some characters to exploit the occasional verticality can give rise to imbalances between the forces in the field . Technically we know that we are not dealing with the production that will flex the muscles of Xbox One, but there were some good moments that reminded us of the reason for a generational leap: the characters are animated with great care and brought to life by spot-on color choices, and the maps are also well built and flow smoothly on the screen even during the most agitated phases, embellished with some small gems such as the possibility of dirtying the walls, destroying some objects here and there, and seeing barrels roll around gthanks to good physics management. In short, without surprising, this Garden Warfare: Plants Vs. Zombies also manages to satisfy on the graphic front, thus proving to be a product that is not perfect but still very fun and accessible.", "date": "2014-02-25", "grade": "8.0"}
