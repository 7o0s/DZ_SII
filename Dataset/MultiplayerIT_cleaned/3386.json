Too bad, because the team of Dark Cloud, Rogue Galaxy and Dragon Quest VIII would be the most talented the Japanese industry can offer and yet it is no coincidence that, apart from the Ni No Kuni saga, the company has focused almost exclusively on franchises clear portable matrix, which then leads us to this review of Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy. The title is young: a brand born on mobile, transported to 3DS and arrived on Switch in the Deluxe version, with all the puzzles and DLC available inside. Operation Nostalgia? No, mostly a restoration operation in the Nintendo ecosystem, given that the 3DS version was in some ways a technical downgrade compared to more performing smartphone panels and chips. Switch can therefore boast what we hope will become the first of many exponents of the Layton series, albeit of the new course, precisely, of his daughter Katrielle. The curious thing is that this looks like a title designed for Switch: sprites, interludes, models are beautiful to see both on the 6.2-inch and on the big screen and the integration of practically any type of input is a very welcome addition. This is joined by the highest list of puzzles ever proposed by a Layton (more than 500, of which 40 are exclusive), a still convincing dubbing and a story capable of keeping company for several hours. Contraindications? Control fusion None, indeed the advice for those who have never played an episode of Layton is to take advantage of it and enter a fairytale world, delicate, colorful, graceful and with a splendid retro European style. For those who know the saga, we are not facing the strongest chapter of the franchise but its enjoyment remains high, on Switch as on mobile: since we reviewed it two years ago, first on mobile and then on 3DS, we will avoid introducing you once again synopsis and progress structure, going directly to tell you about the new fruition of the adventure. This Deluxe edition collects 3 types of control: touch input, analog navigation and directional pad. Level-5 has condensed the mobile and 3DS features into a hybrid platform software, adapting the gameplay seamlessly: you can advance with one finger, move the mouse-style pointer with the stick and navigate the menus with the cross, mixing everything according to your preferences. The playful flow benefits a lot, especially in what on balance is a graphic adventure, albeit modeled according to Hino's unique Japanese vision. We tested Katrielle's story on the go and on the dock; although it is finally easy to experience a Layton on the big screen, the convenience and practicality of enjoying the journey in portability wins the challenge of everyday life, giving Level-5 an easy remake or remaster path which, on the one hand, we hope is already in advanced stage of planning, as it would allow the franchise to speak to a whole new target. The adventure of Katrielle, the dog Sherl and the assistant Ben develops through a path of analysis of scenes, collection of coins, dialogues and interludes, corroborated by a playful structure of puzzles that maintain the qualitative legacy of the brand at good levels . We are talking about puzzles often designed for use on the move, fast, sometimes immediate but mostly fun and capable of effortlessly dragging, within an advancement to separate cases, this too a very mobile logic. Last note should be made on what we consider the strongest weapon of the Switch, even more highlighted on products of this type: the possibility of putting the console on stand-by creates the ideal bridge between short sessions and other very short ones, allowing you to enter the Katrielle's London for a few minutes, perhaps submit the riddle to a friend and put everything back on standby.", "date": "2019-11-07", "grade": "7.8"}
