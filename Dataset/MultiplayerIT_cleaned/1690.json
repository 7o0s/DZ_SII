{"name": "Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tenchu-wrath-of-heaven.html", "text": "The art of murder If in Tenchu 2: Birth of the Assassins silent killings have somewhat given way to pure action, in terms of importance, Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven resumes the tradition of the original game and encourages players to complete missions in the same way cleaner and quieter. Each silent killing, to be clear the type of execution that made the series famous, is rewarded with an ideogram. When the ideograms complete a sentence, the character becomes able to perform a special move, to be used in ~conventional~ battles. The combat system has been improved compared to the past, although there are still some problems, especially regarding the management of the view. This is a ~risk~ factor present in every three-dimensional game, and in this case the developers have tried, at least in part, to fix it. If you attack an enemy (in the normal way, not from behind), the dynamics of the clash will immediately make the virtual camera go haywire, and you will have to continuously center it (with a back button of the pad) to be able to move better. Otherwise, you can hold down the R2 key to have the character always face the chosen enemy, with the view blocked. This type of solution allows you to fight more calmly and move differently, pressing the jump key to quickly sidestep. The problem is that, in this way, you will not be able to ~hit and flee~, and you will have big problems when the opponents are two or more. The perfect ninja kit As in the other episodes of the series, before tackling each mission it is possible to choose a series of objects to take with you. Some of them are old acquaintances (such as the water bottle, useful for recharging the energy bar, or throwing knives), others of new conception. Still others, and this is one of the most interesting elements, can be collected within the stages... and we are not simply talking about food or smoke bombs, but also real weapons, such as spears or bows, which you can use against enemies. They are joined by the usual grapnel, which you can throw on roofs and / or walls to climb immediately. The enemy detection system is also faithful to the original and, alas, also the level of their intelligence. The symbols (question marks and exclamation marks) that you see in the lower left part of the screen, let you understand the distance to the closest enemy and his ability to see you. When the question mark turns into an exclamation mark, it means that the enemy has seen you and will come towards you to kill you. It is precisely at this point that, similarly with what happens in Metal Gear Solid, you can run away or hide to return the situation to normal. This is an evidently simplistic solution, but which is necessary in order not to make the game frustrating. After all, completely ruining a mission due to a slight carelessness would not have been fun at all, and the final evaluation still remains to clarify your degree of merit. Technically speaking Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven stands out for a respectable technical realization. The high-quality graphics engine manages to handle a high number of polygons while maintaining 60 fps without problems, in the vast majority of cases. What is most noticeable, however, is the exceptional quality of the polygonal models that make up the characters, with particular reference to Ayame. Less cared for, of course, are the enemies: they boast well-done animations and a good level of detail, but they lack variety. In practice, normal soldiers are always the same person, perhaps with a different weapon. Another rather annoying detail is represented by the uploads, which alternate not between one level and another, but within each stage. In fact, it seems that the various scenarios are not loaded in full at the beginning of each mission, but ~in pieces~. However, the sound sector of this title is free from any defect: the music is very well done (starting with the sung one of the introduction), the effects are varied and the dubbing of the various enemies has something comical. Concluding... The latest installment in the Tenchu series, the first to arrive on PlayStation 2, looks pretty good. Technically well done and full of depth, it introduces some innovative elements (the combat system, completely revised) and preserves the foundations of a saga that has now made schoolsa in the vein of stealth action games. With its strengths and weaknesses, of course. The presence of uploads within the stages, the sometimes ~chaotic~ realization of the same and the visual problems are drawbacks that are counterbalanced by the solidity of the game structure, by the presence of numerous bosses (another innovative element) and by a collection of objects and moved up to expectations. Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven ultimately takes up and expands on the discussion that Activision began with the first episode, without distorting it. N.B. The Italian version is completely localized in Italian, both as regards the texts and the dubbing of the characters. Pros: Detailed and convincing graphics Quality sound Solid game structure Cons: Quite frequent loading Sometimes it is difficult to orientate Some visual problems The development of the story As anyone who has played with the first Tenchu (released for PlayStation a few years ago) will know, at the end of the game one of the protagonists, Rikimaru, sacrifices himself to save the life of his fighting partner and, if my memory serves me right, a girl saved from evil forces. As we see right in the early stages of the new Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, however, Rikimaru is far from dead: having used the technique of the shadows, he managed to escape the collapse of the caves and is ready to return to the command of Lord Goda. In short, the third episode of the Activision series is proposed as a real sequel to the first, putting us again in command of the two ninjas and adding a character to the squad (Tesshu), usable only after completing the game. The developers, in this case, have also thought of emphasizing the interweaving element of the missions that characterize the path of each ninja. This means that the storyline of the game will become clearer and enriched every time you tackle the scenarios with a different character, completing a picture that starts from earthly events (slave trafficking, corruption) and soon ends in the supernatural world. between demons and monsters. To make you understand exactly what I'm talking about, I'll take the first game mission for example. In the role of Rikimaru, we will have to execute a merchant who, by bribing the authorities, sells women to feed the slave market. By facing the first stage with Ayame, we will follow the same story from a different point of view, revealing further details of the plot. Ditto for Tesshu", "date": "2003-04-10", "grade": null}
