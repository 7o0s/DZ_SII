On the iPhone/iPod Touch front, the third chapter of the well-known saga was made available some time ago, recently followed by a stand-alone expansion - that is, playable in all respects without necessarily owning the original chapter - explicitly dedicated and called The Sims 3 Travel Adventure, developed by EA Black Box studios. This separate chapter has as its objective the framing of a wider experience, aimed in a certain sense at the attempt to annihilate the sedentary lifestyle of the previous episode in favor of a detailed even if not immediate exploration. My life The first approach with The Sims 3 Travel Adventure concerns the knowledge of one's virtual alter ego, and as often happens in many chapters of the brand in question it is necessary to create, thanks to the in-depth editor available, what will then be the protagonist of the entire adventure . For all those who already own The Sims 3, we point out the possibility of loading the old character used, thanks to carefully preserved past saves, in order to skip the laborious initial step and to be able to dive immediately into the first hours of the game . The initial phase that awaits the player is not quite as expected: the real core of this expansion, i.e. travel and the exploration of new destinations, is granted only after a rather long preparation phase in which it is necessary, in addition than getting familiar with the commands again, following our Sim's strictly personal needs: in particular as regards the economic aspect, as per tradition, the fulcrum of the character's entire experience and a great need for the primary objectives. Only once the first tortuous ~lightening~ has been undertaken, with the consequent adequate saving of money, The Sims 3 Travel Adventure allows us to actually start the expansion and to savor all the novelties. You can then buy the infamous plane ticket to leave for the three available areas: Cham Les Sims, Shang Sim-La and Al Simhara, respectively French, Chinese and Egyptian places. Finally free from all constraints, therefore, the simulator allows you to visit many well-known places - including for example the Eifel Tower - and make social relations your usual strong point. The Sims 3 Travel Adventure impresses from a purely technical point of view and presents itself with great merits. The developers have succeeded in creating, in support of the perfectly shaped touch controls, a universe that is once again absolutely convincing. The settings and the fluidity with which all the locations flow thanks to the simple support of the fingertip demonstrate the effectiveness of the graphics engine, despite a certain continuous pop-up probably essential given the limited capacity of Apple devices compared to the original PC counterpart in any case. Small final note for some mini-games present with which to have fun during the adventure, one of which is particularly inspired and can be encountered during a plane flight and also capable of exploiting the motion sensor of the iPhone and iPod Touch. The Sims 3 Travel Adventure expansion is available on the usual App Store at the price of 5.99 euros, which can be purchased through the iTunes Store or directly from each device.
