An uncommon situation which, adding absurdity to absurdity, will start as the simple collection of a request for help and will evolve into the challenge to a powerful man at the head of a criminal organization, a figure who, when revealed, will arouse no small amount of amazement in the player. Professor Layton and the Lost Future, the third chapter of a saga that arrived in Europe with a delayed outbreak but then became a fixed appointment of the Christmas season, exceeding nine million copies sold globally, arrives at the starting blocks with more certainties than doubts : a solid narrative background, exaggerated but delicious characters and an exquisite graphic style have always been the strengths on which Level-5 has pushed to put the uniqueness of this curious variant of the puzzle-puzzle genre in a safe, having rather to work - and here perhaps it is appropriate to admit a little excessive indulgence twelve months ago - on the pace of the narrative and the empathy aroused in the player by the characters who gravitate around the mysteries to be solved, in both cases superior in the first chapter which In the second. A work of adjustments, small but important refinements, which as we will see was carried out in an excellent way. Pixel hunting, with class The structure that the player is called to experience in Professor Layton and the Lost Future is exactly the same as in the other two episodes, therefore, with a narrative line built to accompany the resolution of over 165 puzzles inserted, the real protagonists of what it happens on the screen as much as you try, in a deliberately specious way, to make them homogeneous to the plot, with an exaggerated if not always effective comic effect. If in Mysteries Village this process worked perfectly and in Pandora's Box it did it more on paper than in practice, lacking a bit of heart, in this third iteration the mix of old and new and upcoming characters - in the sense of unpublished and never seen, but also observable in the Laytonian present or ten years in his future - combined with extreme situations such as the use of a time machine and the disappearance of the British prime minister, manage to involve as one would expect, dodging the risk of making the process of interaction with scenarios and characters boring, which has remained unchanged and can be traced back to a simple point and click. The puzzles enjoy the experience that Level-5 has accumulated in the past, presenting a remarkable range of different situations, united by the same principles that have always been embraced by the series: whether it is some number game or a labyrinth to escape from, which you have to untangle the complexities of a riddle or by moving some geometric shape, the puzzles can always be solved simply by working with logic and without getting lost in infinite calculations. Furthermore, the variety of those inserted here is even greater than in the past with a limited use of variations and duplications. Too bad then - or maybe not, it depends on your point of view - that the difficulty level seems to have been lowered a bit, especially in the first hours of the game. The resolution support system is also back which, by spending the coins collected by exploring the pixels of the small touch screen monitor, allows you to obtain up to a maximum of three suggestions for each challenge; the novelty consists in the possibility of spending two at once, after purchasing the third aid, obtaining a ~super clue~ capable of putting the user in front of something very close to the solution. For the rest, the one released last October 23 behaves exactly like any other title starring Layton and his faithful assistant Luke, making the player move back and forth between environments without ever exaggerating with back tracking or, better, successfully moving most of the passages for each stop, with new dialogues, encounters and puzzles around every corner. Prestige frame Just like the story and the atmosphere, the other surrounding elements built around the enigmatic-playful heart of the offer are finished in such a way as to assume a role of great importance. The frame therefore takes on all the burden of immersing the streets of a London traveled by modern technologies but built, from an architectural point of view, in order to highlight its Victorian soul, with the beautiful 2D tables, the brilliant dialogues and hypnotic music, albeit once again limitedin number, which represent a reason for gratification and an incentive to continue, even during the inevitable reasons of tiredness that the approximately fifteen hours necessary to complete most of the puzzles and the story take from time to time. Finally, the three inevitable mini-games that will accompany the player throughout the adventure are back: the first is a sort of interactive book to be completed with stickers obtained in precise passages of the adventure - a bit like with the transfers of when you were small - while the second and third are more substantial, asking you to play with a basic physical model to build perches on which a nice parrot, Luke's new friend, will move and to place arrows on marked fields in such a way such as to move the Layton-mobile along obstacle courses, a bit like in a simplified version of the old ChuChu Rocket!, a title used at the time of the Dreamcast to push the Dreamarena.", "date": "2010-10-29", "grade": "9.0"}
