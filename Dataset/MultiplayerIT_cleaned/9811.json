The formula is proposed again in this sequel, characterized by truly remarkable graphics, driven by the powerful Unreal Engine 4, and by an even richer structure. Also in this case the game looks like a traditional action RPG, downloadable for free on devices iOS and Android but equipped with a free-to-play system that aims to monetize with gacha elements and a combat system that inevitably lends itself to these mechanics, as we will see shortly. History Seven Knights 2, Lene during a dialogue Seven Knights 2 is set twenty years after the tragic epilogue of the original Seven Knights and continues its story, introducing new characters, but also bringing some of the old protagonists back to the screen. The adventure puts us in the role of Lene, a young fighter who has learned from her mother, Queen Eileene, how to fight the dark creatures that constantly threaten the world of Asgar. The defense of the kingdom of Terra takes place as usual, until one day a mysterious girl, Phin, does not appear, who seems to possess particular abilities and at the same time there is a violent attack by enemy troops, led by the lethal Shane: one of the original Seven Knights, who however has succumbed to the lure of demonic power. The situation quickly deteriorates, the fortress falls and the queen is defeated, but Lene and her companions are transported to safety together with Phin and begin to organize a counter-offensive to drive out the evil from the kingdom once and for all. However, they will not be able to do it alone: they will need the help of one of the Seven Knights, Rudy, who however after the events of twenty years earlier has lost track of him. Completely dubbed in English, albeit with ups and downs on the interpretation front, the dialogues of Seven Knights 2 undoubtedly have the merit of carrying forward a narrative that on the one hand does not reserve great surprises for lovers of the genre, on the other it is aimed almost exclusively at those who have played the first chapter and therefore know the lore of reference. Contents Seven Knights 2, a fight made even more confusing by writing, buttons and so on Right from the start, the structure of Seven Knights 2 appears set up in a very similar way to that of an MMORPG, with a frankly confusing interface that crowds the screen with myriads of names and writings, even in the midst of the most agitated situations, creating a general feeling of chaos and relying a little too much on automatisms. On the content front, however, there is little to say: the missions are very numerous and follow one another as we complete the various tasks, marking the progression through unlocking of characters that we will be able to include in our training: there are over forty of them and each one boasts its own set of special moves, as well as specific attack or support skills that can be useful in battle. Seven Knights 2, one of the first boss fights in the game We were talking about automatisms: from navigating within the scenario to fighting, from the special moves of the character we control to those of his companions, practically the entire Seven Knights 2 experience can be entrusted to the CPU. Years have passed since the introduction of these solutions and we are still here wondering what sense they can ever have, but in this case resorting to them proves to be even mandatory during certain situations, when one loses one's way or has to interact in some way with non-human characters. players or collect objects. In addition to the campaign, there are also other modes that allow you to continue the progression and also try your hand at cooperative sessions for four players, specifically more and more complex raids in which you find yourself facing various bosses. Any rewards feed the gacha mechanics, with the summoning of new heroes, equipment or companions, and at this juncture the automatisms can actually help to make the whole part relating to the assignment of objects faster and easier. Gameplay Seven Knights 2, our party explores a snowy setting Seven Knights 2 is advertised as an open world experience, but in reality it is limited to moving within fairly large maps, connected to each other by a load. The touch control system sees the presence of a repositionable virtual stick on the left side of the screen and fixed buttons in thethe right side, unfortunately small: one for the attack or automatic mode, three for special abilities and four for changing characters or activating our companions' specials. Unfortunately, the element that represents the fulcrum of the experience, i.e. the fights, is handled by the game in an inadequate way. It is not a problem of repertoire, indeed the possibilities available to us are always quite varied, but of feedback from the blows, practically absent, and of a general confusion that systematically pervades the fight sequences. The lack of support for controllers unfortunately forces us to deal with an interface without customizations, characterized by buttons that are often too small and by actions that are difficult to manage, such as the simple movement of the camera. Furthermore, there are no evasive maneuvers or parries, and this gives a clear idea of how the developers have thought of managing the inevitable paywall that can occur in the advanced stages of the campaign. However, it must be admitted that in the first hours there are no hitches, the challenge on the contrary it turns out to be all too trivial (but it will inevitably increase going forward) and it is really a pity that the clashes are permeated by this aura of approximation and inconsistency, since visually they are confirmed as frenetic and spectacular. Graphics and sound Seven Knights 2, Shane: charming but deadly From a technical point of view, Seven Knights 2 undoubtedly stands as one of the best action RPGs currently available on iOS and Android. In the game you will not find obsessive attention to every detail and this highlights an often distracted direction, but the quality of the polygonal models, effects and certain animations is truly surprising, especially during the cinematic sequences. The scenarios, on the other hand, move between ups and downs, with convincing assets and a good variety but often generic designs. From the options screen it is possible to adjust various parameters in order to scale the experience for older devices. On the iPhone 12 Pro you can set everything to the maximum, but this determines the inevitable overheating of the terminal unless you compromise on the frame rate: by settling for 30 fps you can keep the visual impact of the Netmarble title without encounter problems.", "date": "2021-11-20", "grade": "7.4"}
