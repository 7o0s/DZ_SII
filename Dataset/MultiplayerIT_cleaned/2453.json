{"name": "Army Men Advance", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/army-men-advance.html", "text": "The most popular military series lands on the Advance! The story of Army Men is inspired by the events that have taken place in the three years of life of the series. Once again you will have to deal with General Plastro and his troop with the usual objective of conquering the earth. Once the cartridge has been inserted and the game mode has been selected, you will be asked to choose between two characters: Vikki and the ever-present Sarge. Your choice will not affect the progress of the game which will be identical for both characters. Furthermore, once the character has been chosen, it will no longer be possible to change it. Gameplay Your task will consist in carrying out various missions such as infiltrating bases, escaping from a prison, investigating an alien presence or looking for communication equipment. Controlling the characters is very simple. By pressing the A button you can fire the selected weapon, while with the B button you can throw grenades. Gameplay The L button instead allows you to change the weapon: the basic weapon you are equipped with at the beginning of the game has infinite ammunition while the grenades and the machine gun that you will find in the first levels can run out, so be careful how you use them seen that the game doesn't allow you to stock up galore. Enemies are timely displayed on the screen and you will have to be very quick to dodge the blows. Gameplay Your movements, even if very fast, will be ineffective in areas with many enemies where you will be attacked by projectiles coming from all directions and it will not be easy for you to dodge them all. Furthermore, it is quite difficult if not impossible to direct the bullets in some directions and therefore the only sure way to shoot down enemies is to take them from the front or from behind. Gameplay Above all, remember that if you die in a level you will have to repeat everything from the beginning and this can be very frustrating in the long run. In the game you will find different weapons including an M-60, grenades, bazooka and flamethrower. During the various levels you will also have to ford rivers and precisely because of the 2D graphics it will be very similar to what happened in Frogger in which you had to jump on the various platforms that followed one another in the river without falling into the water. If you kill the enemies you can also gain the use of their special weapons such as tanks. Graphics and Sound Graphically Army Men Advance uses pseudo 3D graphics built on 2D sprites. The 17 game levels are very similar to the other games in the series. The settings are well done and have very vivid colors, but the presence of few types of enemies makes the prolonged game monotonous. The graphic realization also denotes a marked simplicity that makes the game very similar to one made for Game Boy Color, not taking full advantage of the Advance's potential. The sound effects include your character's voice when he takes a blow or the screams of pain of your enemies who die under your blows: the latter are repeated continuously and cause boredom. The sound of bullets and explosions is nothing special and even the soundtrack is the usual one of military demonstrations with drums and flutes. Conclusions Basically Army Men Adavance barely reaches the threshold of mediocrity by presenting a very simple game with too little attention to detail. The main mode can easily be finished in a day and this is really cold consolation for a player who demands much more from a console with the performance like the Advance. Pros: Brightly colored graphics and very varied environments Possibility to choose between two characters and a good variety of weapons Cons: Difficult to calibrate your shots against the targets from any position Boring music Too short, it ends in a day Losing this game means replay the whole level from the beginning and it just doesn't go down The most popular military series lands on the Advance! The Army Men series made its first appearance on a console three years ago starting in 1999, also enjoying some success. Now 3DO has produced a new installment in the series, this time for Nintendo's new portable console, the Game Boy Advance. ArmyMen Advance is a third-person action game: it features 2D graphics, more solid and with a pleasant impact compared to previous titles that had exploited the 3D one and which, moreover, had not met with the expected success.", "date": "2001-07-11", "grade": null}
