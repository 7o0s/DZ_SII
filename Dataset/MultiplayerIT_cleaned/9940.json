In fact, Hogs of War, from the emblematic subtitle of ~Born to Grill~, put the player at the helm of an army of fierce pigs who, naturally, were destined to end up roasted rather than born to kill. In Saving Private Sheep, however, both the protagonist farm animal changes, which is a sheep, and the game genre, which goes from shooter/action to strategic puzzle game (albeit with a pinch of action); what remains unchanged, however, is the ironic and semi-serious atmosphere of which the game is pervaded, in which the motivations for starting a war border on and often exceed the ridiculous (an event unfortunately not always relegated to the world of video games alone...). The courage to be sheep.. In the land of the sheep, everything flows happily thanks to the loving care with which the shepherds take care of their livestock, keeping the dangerous wolves away. A sudden war, unleashed by no one knows who or why, however forces all the shepherds to run to the front, leaving the poor sheep alone and at the mercy of the enemies. In this sad scenario, General Sheepard, leader of the sheep resistance troops, with a speech to the nation asks all the (little) peaceful beasts to take the field, to save the precious pastures left over from the invasion of the ferocious wolves. From this rather improbable premise begins a fun and immediate title, which embodies the essence of the success of applications on the iPhone: simplicity, playability, freshness of gameplay. The aim of the game will be to land one or more elements of the sheep army on the pastures in danger, which will be parachuted from above. However, the soldiers will almost always be trapped in various obstacles present on several levels, such as platforms or boxes; the player with his fingers has the possibility to break all the objects present and, once the sheep has been freed, definitively conquer the territory. The score of the game will depend on two factors, namely the number of objects destroyed and the time taken: the lower they are both, the higher the value of the medal awarded as a prize. Although there is no general level of difficulty, the game scenarios will be characterized by three different predefined settings, which can be viewed immediately on the match selection map: easy, colored yellow, normal, orange and finally red for the more demanding stages. The nature of the obstacles, usually made of wood, changes several times as you progress through the levels, forcing you to change your saving strategy. In fact, it will be possible to come across both heavy and indestructible blocks of metal and, on the contrary, slabs of fragile ice; some crates could then contain explosives, whose shock wave will act as a propeller for any object within firing range, while starting from the most advanced levels some platforms could be suspended from elastic ropes, with the unstable consequences of the case. When breaking an object you will therefore have to pay attention to the movement and possible fall of both other obstacles placed on the upper level and, above all, the soldiers. In fact, considering that the size of the pasture on which to land is often very small, it is good to try to predict the movements of the objects, in order to avoid ending up outside the landing limit directly between the jaws of the enemies. As a further element of variety, some wolves disguised as sheep militias will try to sneak into the pastures: this time the objective will obviously be diametrically opposite to what has been said up to now and to overcome the scheme it will be necessary to make the clumsy infiltrated wolf fall off the lawn. In productions of this type, based on a brilliant game concept, the technical aspect inevitably becomes a secondary issue; nevertheless, even from this point of view Saving Private Sheep does not disappoint, offering clean, colorful graphics full of fun animations; the touch response is as always precise and punctual, just as the soundtrack and the verses of the woolly creatures are acceptable. With over 80 game levels then there will be the possibility to enjoy real ~hit and run~ fun for a few hours, ideal for passing the minutes during downtime on the train or in the queue. Final gem the implementation of the Open Feint Achievements, that ifalbeit on the sly they are beginning to win fans among players of the Apple platform.
