{"name": "GTR: la recensione!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gtr-la-recensione.html", "text": "...extreme realism, car setup at the limit of madness, telemetry taken from a real program! Password: SIMULATION We immediately point out the initial menu for the three game possibilities offered: Arcade, Semi-Pro, Simulation. Hardcore gamers already know where to go but it is necessary to say a few words about the other modes: the arcade greatly simplifies everything but still offers a fair challenge, it does not allow the use of a single stable but sees you as the protagonists of a series of diversified events. The Semi-Pro is an arcade closer to the simulation, also recommended for newbies. If you start from here with a little sacrifice, you will get great satisfaction. The simulation is all that has been seen in the mod with the addition of a load of options: extreme realism, setup of the car on the verge of madness, telemetry taken from a real program used by real teams (very complicated but exceptional in terms of supply of information!). Anyone who buys GTR must absolutely exploit it in this way, there are no compromises and realism is through the roof. The negative note goes to the physics of the accidents: in some cases the reactions of the cars involved exaggerate the movements and the collisions suffered are not exactly realistic. The cars lose some pieces but in the fronts and in the collisions with the walls they appear quite resistant. Basically this is the only thing that slightly penalizes a title that has a lot to say. Initially we recommend the use of an underpowered car, which already offers its workload to master it; later you can move on to more gritty but hard to tame vehicles. And here we see the simulation complexity offered by the SimBin: every single vehicle is different from the others, and you can feel it. You'll never risk driving two cars the same way because the parameters for each are true to life! (given the collaboration with real teams). The feeling of satisfaction in mastering the racing cars is indescribable; the apprenticeship will be a lot, perhaps too much, but it will pay off amply! As far as the AI of the opponents are concerned, we are above average: they are aggressive, tenacious and also make mistakes. They won't try to ram you with impunity but they won't let themselves be beaten that easily either! Say goodbye to the classic trains or to the total indifference in the curves; in GTR you will find a valid challenge also in the single player! Ferrari Modena, Lamborghini Murcielago, Saleen S7 The graphic aspect of the simulation appears immediately well-kept (even if not always up to today's titles). Each car is recreated with a very high number of polygons which makes it perfectly equal to the original counterpart. As if that weren't enough, the cars implement the reflections of the track and the dirt that sticks to the car (although not so evidently). The particle effects such as smoke and sparks and the ~decor~ elements of the tracks are also good (unfortunately in some circuits less attention is noticed but in any case nothing contemptible). A mention must be made to the quality of the cockpits, all three-dimensional and diversified for each car: inside you will see the dashboards with functioning instruments and indicators, moreover it is possible to move the head to look around (it can be done with the mouse like in a shooter!) . The wheels are also beautiful, appearing photorealistic to the max. As for the GTR circuits, there are ten of them, all real and created through painstaking work that involved the use of GPS. It emerges that every single imperfection has been reproduced, thus recreating the real tracks in a perfect way and, an absolute novelty in the genre, we find the ~real~ curbs, that is, with their reliefs which in some cases prove to be extremely dangerous for the trajectory! Some races can also be tackled driving at night and in adverse weather conditions (unfortunately the weather doesn't change gradually but the results are still excellent). Among the available routes we find classics such as Monza or Magny Cours and novelties such as Brno and lesser known but all exceptional circuits. And new arrivals are expected soon through patches and various mods (it should be mentioned that Nurburgring will soon be made available, the immense German circuit to put every car to the test and those who have played Project Ghotam 2 know it well!). Real Audio inside Another note of merit to the audio of the game: the collaboration with the various automotive teams has allowed the supply of the real sounds (internal and external) of the individual cars for unparalleled sound fidelity! Tire scuffs, braking, gear changes and engine roars are all there, and the sensation offered is unmatched: going from first gear to sixth, hearing a 550 hp engine being pulled is something exceptional! From the curb climb toSuspension noise is all ~real.~ Simply fantastic! On the good side, there are also some captivating tunes in the menus that it is even possible to insert during the race (possibility usually not granted in simulators but the SimBins take care of every detail of customization!). To conclude each circuit depending on the country, it features voices such as pit calls and announcements in the original language of each! Alien runners The multiplayer turns out to be great, with challenges in which the adrenaline is always at its peak since a single wrong maneuver can compromise the entire race. With maximum realism, nothing is enough and you will find yourself in the last position cursing your opponents! Going to connect to a dedicated server you can run races with up to thirty drivers but all this requires a considerable bandwidth. Already with an ADSL there are sometimes uncertainties about the most crowded games but all in all you can play the same. A challenge with more than twenty opponents for an unparalleled carnage and for the enormous sense of competition it manages to offer is a must try! Exceptional for those who can afford it Comment After years of absence of real simulators GTR comes with all its charge of realism and difficulty that true hardcore gamers have craved for a long time. It can be said that we are faced with an ideal sequel (in terms of simulation experience) of the legendary Grand Prix Legend (which despite its now historic release still enjoys many fans). A title like few others see, with obsessive attention to detail. The only major flaw is the damage system that is not exactly excellent but still functional. If you add that even arcade pilots can exploit it with the appropriate mode (even if it is equivalent to a crime!), the title proves to be usable by everyone. Especially recommended for fanatics who love pure and raw simulation. The others are warned: not using it to the fullest of its potential would not honor the excellent work of the SimBins, who show us how much passion allows us to reach the top. Pros: Top-notch simulation Exceptional sound Graphically cared for Cons: Damage physics not up to par Powerful broadband mandatory for multiplayer Some less cared for minor elements Born Mod, live in Gold... Raise your hand if you in the field of automotive simulations have never heard of SimBins! This dedicated group of enthusiasts have created some of the best mods for Electronic Arts' F1 2002, transforming it from an F1 simulator to one of the racing monsters of FIA GT. Their story is available in our previous interview, just mention the fact that, from a simple group of enthusiasts, the SimBins have created their own software house, of which GTR is the first marketed product. The enthusiast's dream come true. Password: SIMULATION The title is the evolution of the great work done in recent years on F1 2002. A complete mod that becomes a paid game in its own right (many have complained but given the quality achieved by the SimBins, one cannot complain too much). The game simulates the FIA GT championship, which sees monsters of 450 and more horses racing, from the Ferrari 360 to the legendary Viper GTS via Lamborghini and Porsche, with a whole series of thrilling cars (just think that the ~poorest~ are the Lotus Elise and the BMW Z3!).", "date": "2005-03-01", "grade": null}
