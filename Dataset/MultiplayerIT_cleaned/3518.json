{"name": "Children of Morta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/children-of-morta-recensione.html", "text": "As we will try to explain in the course of the review, Dead Mage's Children of Morta is not only a top-down action RPG with procedurally generated maps and numerous other rogue-lite elements, but it is also the chronicle of a family and of its dynamics. The plot tells the story of the Bergson family, who have been guarding Mount Morta for centuries. Their life runs smoothly until the day when Corruption begins to spread throughout the world. The only chance for salvation lies in the abilities of the family, whose members will have to try to understand what is happening, while continuing to live their lives. The action of Children of Morta always starts from the Bergsons' house, which we can consider not only a hub area for the missions and the progression of the characters, but also the place where the latter express what they are by making themselves known to the gamer through a series of short interlude sequences, which tell us about their private lives and their interpersonal relationships. Let's explain better: after each mission the game returns inside the house and progresses the story of this married couple with children, a grandmother and an uncle, with dialogues, private moments, skits and so on, creating an intense and in many ways exciting, especially where the stories told end up intertwining with the other more purely playful game mechanics. The Bergsons are a normal family who talk about their mission at the table, but also about different topics such as the temperament of the youngest son or the prospects for the child about to be born. Along the three acts into which the adventure is divided, which we finished in about 12 hours, the family will be enriched with new members, not all necessarily human, who will introduce new secondary stories and complicate the situation a bit. In general, the plot is quite obvious, but it is the way it is told that makes it unusually exciting, to the point that one ends up becoming attached to the Bergsons and their big and small dramas. Game mechanics As we said, Children of Morta is also and above all an action role-playing game in which, at the helm of one of the six playable characters, of which only two are available immediately, you go around large dungeons killing fantasy monsters up to the classics boss. In total there are nine dungeons plus one special one, but the fact that they are procedurally generated makes each playthrough unique. The usable characters all fall within the canons of traditional fantasy, so we have a warrior, an archer, a wizard, a monk and so on, all with their own skill tree, strengths and weaknesses. The game system pushes them all to level up to take advantage of some special abilities. Basically every character has family abilities, whose effects are always active, which radiate to all other playable characters. So leveling up with one means you boost the others significantly as well. Fortunately, accumulating experience points is not as boring as in other games. Using low-level characters in advanced dungeons unlocking the first family skills becomes a piece of cake. The latter require a little more work, but it must be said that not all of them have to be unlocked to finish the adventure and in any case it is the game itself that forces you to use more characters, thanks to a fatigue system linked to Corruption that imposes rest periods to individual heroes between dungeons. Unfortunately it should be noted that the strength of the characters is not very balanced and the gameplay tends to be simpler with those equipped with ranged attacks, such as the wizard or the archer. Familiar skills aren't the only way characters can progress. By leveling up, each of them can spend points on unique active or passive skills from the aforementioned skill tree, usually special attacks and improvements in characteristics. Also, when you die you are returned to the Bergson house where you can spend the money you have accumulated by killing monsters on general upgrades for all characters. For example, in the uncle's laboratory it is possible to improve life points or attack power, while the matriarch can give us bonuses related to the effects of the runes and obelisks encountered while playing. The latter are consumable items, let's call them that, that is, they are found in dungeons and disappear when you are killed or when a mission is completed. Some give timed effects, such as obelisks, others give effects that last for the entire dungeon, and still others give special combat-related powers. Besides that, by killing monsters,by opening chests or raiding the corpses of dead adventurers, gold coins, healing potions and soul stones are found. The latter can be used in various ways, such as to open special chests or to buy items from a merchant, which is unlocked after a particular event. Dungeons and monsters As we said, the Children of Morta dungeons are procedurally generated and are divided into large areas, usually full of monsters to be eliminated (giant spiders, goblins, orcs, creatures related to Corruption, cultists and many others). By searching, you will also find special areas linked to mini events that can unlock new features or give some information about the game world. By events we mean mini missions to be played together with other family members and simple puzzles whose resolution usually yields excellent loot. Their enemies, taken individually, are not very dangerous, but they become so when they attack en masse by combining their characteristics: in addition to the normal brawling minions, there are also enemies devoted to shots from a distance, others capable of area attacks and so Street. Turning around, there are also special enemies, usually equipped with a colored aura, which differs according to their level of strength, which can really hurt. The combat is very linear and mostly requires you to use the weapons and skills of the characters to try to survive. In some cases, elements of the scenario can be exploited to do damage, in particular traps that hurt us as well as our enemies. The bosses, on the other hand, are another matter: big and bad, they cause huge damage and each one must be faced in a different way. Honestly some have proved difficult to defeat with certain characters, but very easy with others. As we said, the protagonists of Children of Morta are not very balanced: it almost seems that some have been deliberately given an advantage to allow everyone to go ahead in the game without repeating the levels too many times. Graphics The pixel art in Children of Morta is simply gorgeous and tastefully animated. Dead Mage has used different techniques to give it a unique feel. Well visible to the naked eye are the excellent frame-by-frame animations, the many hand-drawn objects and the advanced lighting system that gives depth to the scenes, despite being 2D. These are not big innovations from the construction point of view, but they have really been applied with skill and great taste. After all, one of the advantages of drawing graphics by hand is precisely the sense of craftsmanship that ends up transpiring from every pixel. In particular, the members of the Bergson family, although stylized in their features, are well characterized and decidedly more vital than many 3D characters with millions of polygons. However, some of the dungeons are a bit subdued, which evidently pay for the procedural generation in terms of variety and organicity, with the relevant sections that appear to be stuck in an all too artificial way to the generic areas. It was inevitable that this was the case and, fortunately, in the advanced levels the feeling of artificiality is mitigated by the general improvement of the areas represented. In fact it is not clear why Dead Mage chose to start the adventure in the barest area, that of the caves. Maybe he wanted to create an immediate visual contrast with the Bergson house, which is instead so full of details? Let's not talk about sinking defects, mind you, because in reality the technical realization is generally excellent, with animations everywhere and a series of extremely spot-on chromatic choices, and because the limits imposed by procedurality in terms of visual rendering and level design should by now be known by all, but it is fair to note it for those who do not like these solutions very much, which certainly favor replayability, but cloud the identity of the game world. After all, finding the same caves in a hundred different positions ends up having the same effect as the kitchens on display at Ikea: they are all designed differently, but using the same objects. A praise also to the soundtrack by Hamid Reza Ansari, which is not limited to being a simple accompaniment but manages to underline some of the most intense moments with great participation, enriching the scenes with a complex description in notes.", "date": "2019-09-02", "grade": "8.0"}
