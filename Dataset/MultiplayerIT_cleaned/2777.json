{"name": "XCOM 2 Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xcom-2-collection-recensione.html", "text": "In this review of XCOM 2 Collection we finally talk about the transposition of the excellent strategic Firaxis for iOS systems, which arrived almost four years after the debut of the original game for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A period that saw the release of various post-launch contents, primarily the excellent War of the Chosen expansion, but still decidedly long by industry standards. This element bears witness to the hard work that the developers of Feral Interactive (authentic gaming specialists for the bitten apple) had to sustain to make a rather heavy title compatible with Apple devices, which already suffered more than a few hiccups on consoles. The end result is therefore particularly valuable, but comes at conditions that are not exactly accessible to anyone: let's find out why. The necessary premises Tooth away, pain away: XCOM 2 Collection arrives on the App Store at the (almost) record price of 27.99. A bargain, if you consider the value of the title and the fact that the package includes all four DLCs released subsequently plus the huge War of the Chosen, but at the same time a real drain for those who are used to iPhone and iPad spend decidedly smaller amounts for premium experiences. The other entry barrier to consider if you are interested in the game, even before talking about the qualities of this conversion, is the volume occupied by the title in terms of memory: to the 4GB of initial download you have to add almost as many, for a total of more than 8GB of storage required, with a note from the developers recommending that you have at least 17GB free in order not to run into problems during installation. Dulcis in fundo, XCOM 2 Collection absolutely does not run on all Apple devices: the minimum requirements, speaking of the year of release of the hardware, are an iPhone 7 Plus or a second generation iPad Pro (2017). The usual excellent gameplay In short, there are reasons to keep a good portion of users running away, but the fact remains that XCOM 2 Collection is still an amazing game, which in portable format obviously gives up something in terms of graphics but instills the exaltation to have in the palm of your hand one of the greatest strategists of recent times. Referring to our previous reviews of XCOM 2 and War of the Chosen to get all the details on the game if you don't know what we're talking about, here we prefer to focus on the rendering of the gameplay on iPhone and iPad. The foundations in terms of control system and interface had already been laid by the conversion of the XCOM prequel, so Feral continued on that virtuous path proposing the same solutions again: the result is that the game renders very well on a touchscreen (obviously even better on the screen more generous than an iPad), absolutely not regretting the mouse and keyboard, let alone a pad. The management part in the operational base flows away like a pleasure, with all the menus just a tap away, but even during the fights the work done by the developers is commendable, with the keys to perform the various actions positioned at the edges of the screen leaving the view almost completely free, with the user who can manage the zoom and rotation of the camera at any time with a pinch or a circular movement of two fingers. Technical compartment XCOM 2 was not a prodigious title from the point of view of graphics and it is even less so with four more years on the back, but on iOS it still makes a good impression, despite the clear limits that Feral Interactive had to put here and there . In particular, the low resolution of the intermission films and a reduced definition of the textures that are particularly noticeable when the camera approaches the action to record the actions of enemy agents or soldiers immediately catch the eye. Nothing that makes XCOM 2 Collection unpleasant to the eye, but it is clear that it is the least flashy version of the title among those released so far. The sound accompaniment is excellent as always, while it is right to point out the remarkable rapidity of the uploads which leaves the door open to a fruition that is not necessarily too prolonged. It should be noted that our test was carried out without any problems on a flaming iPhone 12 Pro, but on older devices it is not said that everything runs smoothly like oil.", "date": "2020-11-19", "grade": "8.8"}
