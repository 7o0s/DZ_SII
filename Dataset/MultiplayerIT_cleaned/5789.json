{"name": " quasi magia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/161591-cut-the-rope-magic-e-quasi-magia-om-nom.html", "text": "Among the most downloaded titles ever on the App Store and Google Play, Cut the Rope is a puzzle game with apparently very simple mechanisms: in each level our goal is to interact with the scenario to ensure that the funny protagonist, Om Nom , eat a candy, possibly after having collected the three stars positioned in the stage. A formula that immediately proved to be a winner, and which led the Zeptolab developers to experiment, over time, with new solutions in order to be able to offer the many fans of the series an always fresh and varied experience. And so, after the unsuccessful parenthesis of King of Thieves, here we are again grappling with the famous little green creature with a passion for sweets, this time ended up by mistake in a magical world governed by an evil sorcerer. The assumptions are always the same, but the approach changes: if in Cut the Rope 2 some support characters held the court, each with their own unique abilities, in Cut the Rope: Magic it is Om Nom himself who acquires extra abilities in order to complete each of the one hundred levels that make up the long (but not demanding) single player campaign of the game, and to which new stages will be added with the next updates. From the point of view of five zones, each characterized by different shades of color and styles, the protagonist will be able to take on as many aspects, transforming himself into a bird able to lift itself into the air, into a reduced version of himself to cross passages that would otherwise be too narrow, into a mouse with the ability to move towards the cheese, a fish that points to the bottom or an intangible ghost. Cut the Rope: Magic marks Zeptolab's return to its most popular franchise, and it's a comeback in a bang Transformative puzzle If the structure of Cut the Rope: Magic has remained unchanged, presenting the same tried and tested ~rewards~ system seen in the previous episodes of the series, with the need to collect a certain number of stars (and therefore to replay levels that we had completed partial) to be able to access the new areas, it is the gameplay that boasts the most relevant innovations. The formula is the one we know well, God forbid, but the transformations actually manage to change the experience and avoid an excessive weighting of the mechanics: when the puzzles get complicated, in practice, you move on to the next world and you have to face different situations. However, we are very far from the static nature of the beginning, given that often (especially during the bosses) the resolution of a puzzle depends on our speed of execution and not only on a reasoning about the elements we see on the screen and that we have to move to make make Om Nom eat his candy. A factor that applies above all to the transformations into a little fish and into a spirit, given that in the first case we will be dealing with an inertial aquatic system and in the second with very busy situations, in which timing becomes essential. This system, so solid and convincing, is accompanied by an excellent technical realization, capable of making the most of the cartoonish atmospheres of the game, the funny expressions and transformations of the protagonist, as well as the wonderful colors of the different scenarios.", "date": "2016-01-07", "grade": "8.6"}
