This is what the Oddworld Inhabitants guys managed to do in the space of almost ten years, starting in 1997 with the adventure Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and closing the saga with Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath in 2005. Original mix of adventure in third person and FPS, the game sees us take on the role of the mysterious Straniero (Stranger), a bounty hunter whose goal is to raise a large sum of money to afford a surgical operation that could save his life. But who really is the Stranger and what kind of surgery does he want to undergo? We'll find out throughout history, between one mission and another, trying to raise money by throwing criminals in jail, whether they are alive or dead. The HD reissue of Stranger's Wrath, developed by Just Add Water, adapts the entire technical sector to current standards: 720p video resolution, frame rate of sixty frames per second, redesigned textures and re-engraved dialogues. Those who have played it on Xbox will be able to take advantage of the opportunity to take a ~second round~ and enjoy the Oddworld in the splendor of high definition, but it is above all new users that the game is aimed at, offering them in the first place a concept of challenge and progression very distant from that of current productions, secondly a fascinating plot, capable of involving and also leaving you stunned thanks to some valuable twists. Dead or alive you will come with me The Stranger, the protagonist of the adventure, is a sort of anthropomorphic tiger who can walk upright or, if necessary, run using all four of his limbs. Skilled in hand-to-hand combat, he is equipped with a double-shot crossbow that uses living projectiles, in this case small animals or large insects that we can find within the scenarios and that we must ~stun~ and collect to recharge our supplies. Ammunition is a key element in terms of gameplay, because the effectiveness of our attacks, as well as the possibility of launching them or not, substantially influences the outcome of the clashes. In fact, if in the early stages we find groups of badly organized enemies, who control their territory in a disorderly manner and moving away from each other, it will be enough to complete a few missions for the situation to change drastically and it will be necessary to operate with cunning and using a pinch of strategy not to succumb. The reason is easy to say: just suffer a few hits to incur the game over. Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD uses a ~hybrid~ system for managing vital energy, which does not automatically recharge in moments of ~recovery~ but depends on a second bar which instead rises over time: by pressing the Triangle button we empty this last in favor of the first, but to do so we must necessarily stop and therefore already be out of reach of our opponents. Returning to the subject of bullets, the only infinite ammunition at our disposal are the ~electroflies~, insects equipped with an electric charge with a low impact potential, which however prove useful when there is a need to obtain other ~animals~ to add to the equipment or cause the detonation of classic explosive barrels. Cute little animals to shoot Shooting flies against an enemy of medium size is practically useless, therefore it is necessary to resort to ammunition of a different kind. Like the bolamites, large spiders that imprison the victim with their web for a few seconds, or the squirrels, which attract one or more opponents towards their position, isolating them from the group. Or even the skunks, capable of momentarily putting even more enemies into turmoil, and the bees, to be fired in bursts like a machine gun. Then there are the explosive bats, extraordinarily effective even against armored units; the spheroids, furry little animals that bite everything that comes within range; and armadillos, heavily armored insects that inflict significant damage on the enemy. Furthermore, using an extension for the crossbow, it is also possible to fire sniper bullets from long distances. You can select ammunition via the d-pad and assign it to the left or right side of the weapon, then opening fire with the respective back buttons. In practice, the combat phases can take place by alternating the first person and third person views, after all, to switch, just press the right analog stick on its axis. For example, we can shoot a squirrel in FPS mode to lure an enemy into the open, then knock him out after switching to tthird person and ~suck it up~ like a new ghostbuster in the Stranger's bag. The same practice must be repeated for the boss on duty, dead or alive (in the first case the amount collected will be much higher), to then be exhibited in the nearest bounty store to obtain the coveted bounty. Playstation 3 trophies Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath contains thirty-seven trophies, five of which are hidden. The latter are obtained by unlocking all the other trophies, finding the black market in a specific location, and so on. The other trophies are obtained by gradually collecting the various bounties, by completing the game on all three difficulty levels or by collecting a certain number of moolahs. The wonderful world of Oddworld The setting of Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD is practically western, with the Stranger wearing a cowboy hat, boots and coat and wandering through canyons and underground cave-like structures, then stopping in progressively larger cities, inhabited by clackers (ludicrous chicken-like creatures). Although things change at a certain point, the game structure remains almost unchanged while the elements of variation, mainly consisting of the addition of new types of ammunition for the crossbow, are all ~spent~ during the first hours of the adventure . Therefore, we are still stimulated by the curiosity to find out more about the protagonist and his background, as well as the degree of challenge which, as mentioned above, will already give us some headaches at the ~normal~ level. Also due to lack of gameplay, in reality, which is divided between two different worlds (third-person action game and FPS) without therefore expressing itself at its best in one or the other guise. The platform phases are in fact visibly ~old gen~, with the virtual camera struggling to move in confined spaces and animations that are not very beautiful to see (such as when you climb a rope), while as a shooter Stranger's Wrath focuses too much on strategy and it doesn't give us a chance to do much if the enemies charge us in large numbers, also due to scenarios that are often excessively open and without hiding places. The same idea of living ammunition, to be procured every time, on the one hand strongly characterizes the Oddworld Inhabitants product, on the other it also represents its limit, given that it often happens to run out of bullets in key situations. Finally, the speech on the technical realization must be made, which certainly gains a lot in this HD re-edition compared to the original for definition and fluidity, but it is not all rosy: the general design is more than inspired, but the graphics often appear excessively dirty, the textures are not always high resolution and in the changes of shot you notice some shots. Furthermore, the subtitles in Italian are present only for the most important dialogues and leave out the jokes exchanged with passers-by, which even in some cases serve to understand what we have to do (and the words of an American voice actor who imitates a chicken are not always very clear).", "date": "2012-01-23", "grade": "8.0"}
