The end of the charismatic hero on the bike, rifle in hand and cigar in mouth, clearly inspired by the protagonist of Metal Gear Solid, underlines how the experience developed by Game Science is not based on the contribution of individuals, but rather on group action. Specifically, the battles in the game involve over two hundred units simultaneously also on iOS devices, thus staging highly frenetic and visually impactful clashes, but at the same time chaotic and difficult to read. Once one of the three available factions has been selected, a tutorial will introduce us to the basic mechanisms of this variation on the MOBA theme, in which the goal is, as usual, to overcome the opposing defenses until the enemy base is destroyed. Unlike the blockbuster Clash Royale, the scenario in this case develops horizontally and has a central area that can be used by troops to temporarily recharge their energy. However, the management of the units is completely automated and our contribution will have to be limited to placing them on the map, according to a strategic approach in which numerical superiority does not necessarily translate into success. War and pitch The freemium dynamics of Art of War: Red Tides are quite elastic and do not limit the use of the experience in any way, releasing rewards and new units to add to your roster at regular intervals. From a structural point of view, the game allows access to normal or ranked matches, with one-on-one or three-on-three clashes supported by a single player mode based on increasingly difficult missions. Leveling up will also allow you to play classified matches, so as to eventually climb the rankings and aspire to ever richer rewards. The system works very well, thanks to a soft launch that has created a rich user base in Asia, and you enter the game within seconds, with the only difference in group battles being having to wait your turn to place the units on the map. In the lower part of the screen we find our troops, to be generated in greater or lesser numbers depending on the energy available at that moment, while on the right there are three special abilities that change according to the faction and require a long time loading, but they allow you to hit the enemy in various ways: petrifying his soldiers, carrying out targeted bombardment, firing a huge cannon along a horizontal trajectory, etc. As anticipated, the behavior of the units in the field is completely automatic: once the soldiers have been created, they will proceed in groups against enemy targets, literally fighting to the death. Only in certain cases will we be able to directly activate special attacks, for the rest our task will consist in reading the situation in the best way and planning how many and which warriors to send to fight, also on the basis of the opponent's setup. Such limited interactivity undoubtedly lends itself to carefree games, even if more often than not the enormous chaos that is generated on the screen at a certain point makes it really difficult to understand what is happening, transforming the gameplay into a repetitive sending of new troops into the hope that their numbers will be enough to break through enemy lines and destroy their base. From a technical point of view, the amount of characters in action is managed effectively, but the distant view and the impossibility of zooming, if not slightly, diminishes everything, preventing you from appreciating good-level effects and some noteworthy animations .", "date": "2017-10-05", "grade": "7.0"}
