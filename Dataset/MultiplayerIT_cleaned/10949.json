{"name": "Unsolved Crimes - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unsolved-crimes-recensione.html", "text": "The king of detective games, on DS and beyond, is the acclaimed Phoenix Wright: the saga in question, developed by Capcom, made known to the general public what until then, even for its own limitations, had been a genre sectoral. No software house that wants to develop a similar title can avoid the comparison with the Capcom production. Now Production, author of Unsolved Crimes, was far-sighted in this respect: its detective story tries to exploit the successful trail of Phoenix Wright, however differing enough not to be a clone. The schoolboy Unsolved Crimes puts the player in the role of a detective totally devoid of name, gender or background, using and at the same time taking an identification procedure to extremes which, at least in the videogame field, was made famous by Zelda. The almost complete silence of the protagonist, however, greatly affects the overall experience of what an investigation game should be: you cannot interrogate suspects - you will only be given a summary of the depositions - and you cannot even talk to your own colleagues on their own initiative. The absence of direct relationships with potential criminals could be considered a choice rather than a defect, given that this factor is the pivot around which the entire Phoenix Wright series revolves, however it is not counterbalanced by a desired deepening of the investigative instance . In each mission you are accompanied by a young and veteran policewoman, Marcy Blake, who guides the player in the search for clues and possible evidence of the crime. The main flaw of Unsolved Crimes is precisely that the investigation is not coordinated by the protagonist, but by his assistant. In the early stages of the game, such a structure could suggest a temporary situation, a sort of tutorial waiting for the reversal of roles; as the hours go by, however, it becomes clear that the player's subordinate role is not destined to change. The form is antithetical to the content, unable to convey the typical sensations of the investigation: constantly submitted to the will of others, the protagonist appears more like a student answering the professors' questions than a New York police detective. '70 The most successful aspect of the game is certainly the 70s setting, well recreated through well-chosen stylistic choices both in terms of visuals and sounds. Buildings, clothes and cars are all attributable to that era, as are the retro melodies and sound effects which, although not excellent in and of themselves, succeed in taking the player back in time. Unsolved Crimes has a very sober aesthetic, it allows itself a few customizations: the result, however, is convincing and functional to the dark atmosphere of the game. Above all, and more importantly, it gives this detective story an apparently more mature tone than Phoenix Wright, makes it more realistic, potentially more suitable for all those adults, unfamiliar with traditional games, that Nintendo has managed to include in the pool of Nintendo DS user. Technically Unsolved Crimes is fluctuating: some polygonal models are remarkable, while the immobile illustrations that form the background to the dialogues seem to be actual shortcomings rather than stylistic choices. Investigator The missions are substantially divided into two phases, preceded by a brief (and valuable) animated introduction which presents the case: in the first part, the place of the crime is explored, in the second, by analyzing the clues found, hypotheses are formulated aimed at dissolving the final doubts related to the investigation. Both sections are irreparably corrupted by the feeling of impotence described above: during exploration, beyond the somewhat cumbersome controls (the view is in first person), we are not provided with information on the elements which, to use the words of the game, ~they don't concern the case~ (although, being near the crime scene, they potentially could have been important). This modus operandi immediately reduces the number of possible criminal scenarios: the player is channeled into a linear and obvious path, the opposite of what an investigation should be. Once we have recovered all the information that the developers wanted us to collect (neither more nor less), the deductive process starts: the reasoning is totally guided by the questions of Marcy Blake, the almost omniscient colleague, to whom she replies through multiple answers. Theoretically, the player could also solve the investigation without paying attention to the case, only answering Marcy's questions. Another serious shortcoming, again attributable to linearityof the path traced by the developers, is the impossibility of solving the case before the expected time, despite having enough evidence. The individual missions, apparently unrelated, are merged together by a plot that manifests itself only after a few hours of play. Interluding between one investigation and another are some sketchy arcade sections, which don't add much to the value of Unsolved Crimes. The overall quality of the product is also undermined by the lack of longevity: it takes about ten hours to complete all the missions, and the investigations are so linear and devoid of facets that they do not justify a second review of them. Comment Now Production did a good job of brainstorming, though not particularly ambitious: a darker, more realistic Phoenix Wright detective game set in the USA during the 1970s. Even the stylistic aspect has been treated in the same way: nothing experimental, but functional creations to build the retro aesthetic. It is the interaction, the heart and main expressive vehicle of every videogame, that compromises the success of the project: guided, linear, repetitive, totally antithetical to the aims that an investigative game should set.
