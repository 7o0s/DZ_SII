The origin of these stories, all more or less with an urban setting, often starts from a real or at least credible starting point, to then be enriched over time with invented and fictional elements, useful for surrounding them with charm and mystery. One of the most widespread locations of legends are certainly the sewers: also known for having hosted the 4 most famous fighting turtles in the world (complete with a master mouse), the underground system for the treatment of dark water has always been a receptacle for any animal creature or unwelcome vegetable on the surface. Batman fans will surely remember the Penguin, abandoned in the sewers by his parents because he was ugly and deformed, while everyone or almost everyone will have heard of crocodiles suddenly popping out of (rather large) toilet bowls. Where is my water? therefore proposes the point of view of one of these ~sewer crocodiles~, protagonist of one of the best known urban legends but dissident with the majority of his fellows and for this reason, as always happens, opposed and frowned upon. Wash well behind the ears! Swampy, the likeable reptile protagonist of Where's my water?, therefore has a completely different vision than the rest of his companions; contrary to the other underground crocodiles in fact, not only is it unable to live among the sewage but it is truly a hygiene freak, so much so that it often takes long and pleasant baths in its tank. His former companions have never accepted this behavior and have therefore decided to boycott Swampy's daily hygiene by interrupting the flow of water; the player's task is therefore to restore the connection, providing the very clean crocodile with an adequate jet of water to take care of its freshness. Between the pipes and the bathroom to be filled there are numerous obstacles to remove, the first of which is given by the presence of soil to be dug out: with the simple passage of the finger over the affected areas it is therefore possible to remove the soil, thus clearing the way for the 'waterfall. However, the precious liquid is sometimes found in conditions that are not easy to transport: in fact, it happens that along the ideal route to reach Swampy's tap, you find yourself in front of rapidly growing algae, whose contact with water is enough to make them become so large as to hinder its passage (and moreover absorbing it definitively); but in the city subsoil it is not uncommon to find pockets of toxic slime which, once touched, make the water definitively unusable. However, the particular structure of the puzzle game allows you to exploit originally harmful elements to your advantage: for example, creating a channel between the poisonous liquid and the algae allows the latter to be destroyed, thus freeing the way. Along the 80 levels, the particular situations to be faced will in any case be truly varied and, in certain cases, even challenging from a logical point of view: between taps to be opened in time, traps, switches and explosives to be triggered in the right sequence, the minutes dedicated to the solution some puzzles will literally seem to fly away. For the sake of fairness, a small inconvenience remains to be noted in the levels that develop in length, where since it is impossible to control the whole situation in real time, it becomes mandatory to scroll the view with the awkward slide on the left. But the objectives of Where's My Water? they certainly don't end here: in fact, to move forward in the levels it is not enough simply to have Swampy washed well but, above all, one must be careful to collect the rubber ducks scattered throughout the journey. If it is true in fact that many of these ducks are found along the natural path of the water, in many other cases it is necessary to divert the liquid on purpose to lick the rubbery bird, with all the risks involved; digging in the dirt then it is possible to find some collectibles that provide further bonus points. The work done with the physics of liquids is without a shadow of a doubt exceptional: in fact, water moves naturally, forcing you to calculate its route in an almost obsessive way; certainly the appearance seems a little thicker than normal, but a too liquid and transparent consistency would certainly not have allowed an immediate evaluation of the behavior along the excavated tunnels. However, the general technical realization is very pleasant, colorful and with fun animations and sounds in full Disney style. Compatibility with Game Center lenses but especially the lungo (and free!) support promised by the developers finally complete the already very positive picture.
