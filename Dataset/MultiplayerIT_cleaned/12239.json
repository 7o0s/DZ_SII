The contact between the three young people and Microsoft had taken place last summer, during an internship at the Redmond company. Evidently the passion and desire to create something for their favorite console had reached the ears of some big shot, and after a series of proposals and negotiations, the group of friends finally managed to give birth to their first creation, a shooter horizontal scrolling in full Gradius or R-Type style. Microsoft has joined him a programmer from Carbonated Games, the software house author of the great success on Live Arcade! which responds to the name of UNO!, which helped the small team to fully realize their ideas. Aegis Wing is available on the American marketplace, absolutely free for a period. Weapons and Final Bosses Aegis Wing has the gameplay of all the classics of its genre in its blood, it does not bring innovations or upheavals on the subject, and represents for all long-time players a pleasant and exciting title to play, with which everyone it will certainly find a certain familiarity in both the controls and the concept. A side-scrolling shooter was certainly missing from the massive list of downloadable games from Microsoft's online service, and the guys behind the project had certainly felt this gap left in the lineup. There is little to explain for those accustomed to shooters; we find ourselves in command of the usual space ship equipped with a burst machine gun and a series of power-ups and super weapons available, to be taken as the levels progress. The schemes are full of enemies right away, and the challenge level starts very high from the first seconds. The quantity of alien spaceships (we assume they are from other planets) is high, and it immediately becomes clear that our little machine gun is absolutely not enough to make a clean sweep. The rate of fire has been set too slowly, we feel the lack of greater power during the clashes, and we often find ourselves in difficulty precisely because it is not possible to be able to hit everything you would like. The end-of-level bosses are quite big and annoying with their powerful cannons and lasers, always supported by other annoying ships. The movements are well done, as are the animations and camera movements: Aegis Wing is completely in 3D, while maintaining a classically two-dimensional approach, which often rotates in perspective revealing the (modest) polygonal mass of the title. Graphics, sound and multiplayer As we said, the polygonal count is absolutely not next-gen. Not that there was a particular need, in a genre of this type, but certainly Aegis Wing doesn't make you cry out for a technical miracle. The definition is excellent, as Xbox 360 and its bright and colorful textures have always accustomed us to. On the screen there are also some discreet effects, such as the particle effect of fire explosions, or the ~stone in water~ effect that causes using the weapon that creates a sort of black hole in front of us. By destroying some particular enemies, as per tradition, we can obtain some fire upgrades. The main weapon is the one that will accompany us through all the levels of the game, while the secondary weapons are taken away and can be used once, after which they run out and must be searched for again. The first was mentioned earlier: a sort of energy sphere that makes everything in front of us disappear like a black hole. There is another one, the classic super laser beam, which is the most powerful in the game and is very useful against the final bosses. In 4 players it is possible to unite the spaceships by pressing the X key as if we were a Japanese super robot Graphics, sound and multiplayer Still another is represented by a series of self-seeking missiles, which you just need to release to see them head towards all on-screen enemies present at that moment. The most original weapon is the shield, which not only protects us but manages to bounce enemy fire, like a sort of ~reflected mirror~ that manages to destroy the enemies themselves. It is not the first time that the blows aimed at us can be useful, just remember Ikaruga of Treasure. The sound sector is decidedly uninspired and anonymous, and contemplates a series of background music that accompanies each level without arousing particular emotions: the times of Thunderforce are far away, and they always remain unsurpassed. One of the most interesting novelties of this new game for Live Arcade is, however, the ability to play it in multiplayer, both offline and online through the Live. In 4 players it is possible to unite the spaceships by pressing the X key as if we were a Japanese super robot: the commander of the shuttle takes control of the movement, while all the others shoot like mad through the fire stations. The gimmick is that even the ~merged~ players can use the special weapons once hooked up, giving rise to interesting combinations such as the use of the energy shield while the others shoot at full speed. Goals 360 The 200 points of Aegis Wing are decidedly difficult to complete in their entirety. After the first two or three relatively simple and unlocked almost immediately, there will be a bit of sweat, also because many require the participation of other players. Comment Aegis Wing is a must download for two simple reasons: it's free, and you can play live multiplayer with up to 3 other friends. Remember a title where four spaceships come together and you all fight together? This allows it, and it's a hoot. The title supervised by Carbonated Games in single player is instead very ~classic~, difficult but pleasant. It never has absolutely irresistible gameplay peaks and is not very long-lived, but it represents a nice diversion in the Live Arcade lineup which has not yet contemplated any side-scrolling shooter. Pros: 4 player multiplayer It's free! Finally a horizontal shooter Cons: Primary fire too slow Graphically more could be done Anonymous music", "date": "2007-05-30", "grade": null}
