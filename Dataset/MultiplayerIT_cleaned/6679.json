The playing field is therefore different, with particularly strong competitors (especially at Gameloft) who force you to make precise choices in order to diversify your offer; and the new Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War is the child of these needs. The franchise, created by Gearbox Software almost ten years ago and landed on mobile devices in 2008, in fact returns to using a third-person view, and does so with the intention of placing itself in direct competition with the now numerous cover shooters available on App Store and Google Play. The early stages of the long single player campaign, made up of eight chapters set during the Second World War between France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Denmark, suggest just such a product, or a shooter in which you have to lurk, perhaps changing shelter as needed, and eliminate the enemies that appear from time to time on the screen. In reality, the gameplay is that of a real third person shooter, which however uses the expedient of stalking to give solidity to an experience that otherwise would prove to be too much a dancer, given the obvious shortcomings of artificial intelligence (try to get closer to an enemy, especially from behind, and observe the slowness of his reactions) and a touch control system that feels comfortable only in a static context. A bonus is represented by our ~brother~ on duty, to whom we can ask for help for a placed shot, but this is a feature that goes a little muted. Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War suffers a bit of an identity crisis, but has a rich and solid campaign Brother, don't be an ass It happens that during the shootings we are caught off guard, with an enemy who appears in front of us as we move from one shelter to another, and in such situations the weaknesses of the Gameloft product come to light in a clear and merciless way, together with a narration which appears hasty, lacking the time necessary to effectively tell the accompanying plot. These are problems that prevent this production from establishing itself clearly, but which after a few games we tend to consider decidedly less, shifting our attention to the variety of missions and to a campaign that does not spare situations, ideas, engaging moments . Eliminating all enemies, freeing hostages, placing explosives, dedicating yourself to anti-aircraft fire, covering your teammates from afar with your sniper rifle or resisting attacks for a while are just some of the things we'll find ourselves doing in the game. The semi-automatic aiming (which cannot be deactivated) degrades the degree of challenge a (quite) bit, however the solidity of the system remains intact and, in the same way, the effort required to complete the levels gradually grows, together to the traditional freemium-style progression that forces us to use the virtual money earned to upgrade the arsenal (made up of rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles and other extra weapons, which can be purchased separately) and to endure some waiting for the improvement operations to be completed, unless you want to use hard currency. The presence of the by now traditional ~action points~, which are consumed every time we face a mission, even two or three at a time, does not constitute an insurmountable problem during the first half of the adventure, thanks to the frequent level crossings, which restore all the energy. In the more advanced stages, however, it will be necessary to take into account some more limitations, albeit nothing dramatic. In terms of technical realization, Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War moves between ups and downs, limiting the variety of polygonal models and saving a little on animations, but diversifying the settings and keeping their density high. Of course, some advanced shaders would have helped to give more depth to the scenarios, and the gap with the most recent Gameloft titles is quite clear.", "date": "2014-12-17", "grade": "7.9"}
