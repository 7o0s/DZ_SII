This enormous proliferation of games dedicated to the prince has forcibly led to a lowering of the average quality of the individual products, so much so that main, subordinate and even, recently, second degree subordinate projects can be clearly identified: this episode for DS, as an investment, falls without 'shadow of a doubt in the last category. Whether it's a low-budget job can already be understood from the presentation, quite rudimentary in the animations, and the sensation gets stronger over time: in short, even before tasting the essence of the game, you notice the lack of refinements - graphics , sonorous, rhythmic - which distinguish the most important episodes of the series. New Prince of Persia DS Despite being the best-selling console on the planet, Ubisoft has decided to pay homage to the DS with, at most, a Count of Persia (who, yes, is also under the Marquis): whatever the merits or faults of the Indian subdivision - which has developed the DS version of Forgotten Sands - it should be clarified that the ~French~ multinational had already allocated much, much lower funding to this edition than the others (PSP included). And this is a pity, because the idea behind the game is far from silly: basically it is a return to the origins, where by origins we mean Prince of Persia, born in 1989, largely anchored to the two dimensions. The entire control system, like Zelda or Kirby: Canvas Curse, as, in practice, in the bravest DS games, is entrusted to the Touch Screen. The main problem, which we will analyze in more detail from here on out, is that the game represents more of a point of collision between these two souls than an ideal union between the two. Forgotten Sands is not exactly structured like the original Prince of Persia: in addition to the absence of the timer, to separate the individual stages there is a spartan New Super Mario Bros-style map, and between one level and another you can even visit a small shop to buy upgrades (weapons, clothes and similar amenities), actually rather superfluous (the increase in stats has little effect on interaction with enemies). Not only that, in addition to the map, a scan has been included in typically Mariesca worlds. Not that it goes from sky to desert to snow, but there's the classic 6-7 level progression before the ~final boss~; the affinities do not end there, given that for each stage there are some hidden chests, the discovery of which is not necessary to pass the stages (a bit like the three secret coins in the Nintendo game). Even in this area, however, it seems that the developers have given little thought to these features, which seem to have been inserted more for conformity than for effective consistency with the dynamics of the game. If they had limited themselves to reviving the stylistic code of the first Prince of Persia in a polygonal key, without maps, shops or hidden objects, probably the public would not have noticed its absence, and they would have had more time to shape the raw material. Clumsy touch The design of the stages is not bad, or rather, it is not bad at all: simply all the work is nullified by the control system. Independently examined the commands appear well oiled: like Link in Spirit Tracks the prince faithfully follows the movements of the cursor, from right to left, from top to bottom, he swings his saber when a line is drawn, even, like the wind in Lostwinds, you can move sand around the screen by dragging it with the stylus. Furthermore, exactly like Link, the prince automatically jumps from one platform to another: unlike Zelda, however, Forgotten Sands is not an action-rpg, but a platform with action elements, and the fact that in a 2d platform there is certainty absolute ability to make a jump, regardless of speed and timing, completely mortifies the challenge and resets the tension. There are times when you can't jump headlong towards the next platform, but the obstacle is not represented by the void itself, but by the objects/blades that often wander between one shelf and another. To complicate life for the player, the developers have inserted some simple puzzles here and there for the stages - even these quite Zeldian, like the classic push the stone / pull the stone - which, however, are not very incisive and break the rhythm of the action too much. olthree to be, like many other elements, out of context. Although the quality of the games is quite fluctuating, the Prince of Persia series has always stood out for a refined visual style, starting from the excellent progenitor to the recent cel-shaded episode: even in this field there have been declines , but even push-ups have never dipped below the level of decency, and Forgotten Sands for DS is no exception. Certainly the super-deformed style is not very representative of the saga as a whole, but it is suitable for this episode, and the technical realization is quite good: to remain consistent with the inconsistency of the project, the developers have inserted illustrations and very cut-scenes , much more realistic than the stylistic canon used in the game phases, and this contrast is probably the most annoying aspect of the graphics, which as a whole, however, as mentioned before, look good at all.", "date": "2010-06-07", "grade": "6.0"}
