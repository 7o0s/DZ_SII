All characteristics that, at least on paper, would seem to belong to this Kiwanuka, the first work of the small CMA Megacorp team: let's see, therefore, if these good intentions have translated into a title that is truly worthy of attention. The union makes the effort Certainly Kiwanuka does not lack personality, so much so that he can afford to debut without giving any explanation of what is happening on the display: from the title screen, accompanied by a powerful dubstep soundtrack, you go directly to the gameplay, with the player finds himself having to manage the fate of a handful of tiny people led by one of their kind who holds a mysterious magical scepter in his hand. The tutorials are therefore relegated to a few signs - also distinguished by a bad translation into Italian - which illustrate the basic mechanics, without however going into too much detail and leaving doubts that can only be dispelled by direct experience. The aim of the game is to lead the followers to the finish line of the various levels, represented by a prism of energy that traps a member of this colorful tribe of little beings. To do this, the user assumes direct control of the magical light generated by the staff possessed by the leader of the group, which everyone blindly follows: it is therefore sufficient to tap on the scepter and drag your finger left or right to make sure that the characters move in that direction, being careful not to make them fall into the void and thus cause an immediate game over. The real focus of Kiwanuka, however, emerges after just a couple of preliminary levels, and translates into the somewhat bizarre method that the developers allow the player to overcome the empty spaces that separate one platform from the other: dragging the finger from the scepter towards the From above it is therefore possible to form a human chain of followers of the desired height, who then have to be pushed in one direction or the other to make it swing until reaching the first available handhold. Once this picturesque bridge has been placed in the appropriate location, the group can be ordered to trample on their own kind with impunity to reach their destination, all obviously in the name of the proverbial end that justifies the means... Kiwanuka has style to spare, but lacks the quid capable of making him make the leap in quality Such a simple formula is soon enriched by a series of variables that have been used by the developers of CMA Megacorp to give variety to the design of the stages in the course of the game. So here we find ourselves in front of mobile platforms, colored areas on which it is not possible to walk or make a bridge take root and so on, to the full advantage of a level of challenge which in any case never gets too demanding. In addition to this, the user is invited to discover the different properties that are applicable to the human chains to which the magic scepter originates: one of the first examples in this sense concerns the fact that it is possible to build bridges that cross a wall , allowing followers to cross it. Consistent with his choice not to explain almost anything to the player, Kiwanuka also in this area does not provide any kind of clue, a choice that will surely cause divisions between those who find it stimulating and those who instead could include it in the list of frustrations, which in fact involve also a far from flawless control system. Not only does the group not always understand the user's inputs well - crossing a bridge when instead they would like to generate another one or falling into the void while simply trying to get close to the edge of a platform - but also the system adopted to establish the dimensions of a chain sometimes you slap yourself with the camera: it can therefore happen that the circle indicating the scope of the path that will be generated goes beyond the standard shot, forcing you to go blind or to further decrease the zoom, making the elements interactive even smaller than they are in the standard view. In short, not everything goes perfectly smoothly in Kiwanuka, which in the end proves to be an intriguing puzzle game in its premises, but which fails to be truly engaging like the best exponents of the category. However, it remains necessary to give credit to CMA Megacorp for the originality of the concept and for the'inspiration of the very pleasant audiovisual sector that acts as a complement to the action.", "date": "2014-05-20", "grade": "7.7"}
