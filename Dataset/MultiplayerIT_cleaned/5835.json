Each will be sold for 9.99 but it will also be possible to purchase a season pass to access the four remaining chapters for 29.99, or buy the whole package in a single solution for 39.99. Only in the latter case will you also have access to a bonus epilogue. On Multiplayer.it we will review the individual chapters with a simple indication of whether or not to proceed with the purchase while the last episode will offer our classic numerical vote which will take into account the entire package. The secret of a good story is not the 'relevance to the truth and not even the story itself, but the way it is told. Without the touch that made it great, ~A Fistful of Dollars~ would be just a rip-off of Kurosawa's ~The Challenge of the Samurai~, without its twists, ~A Song of Ice and Fire~ would be yet another means fantasy with little magic. The ~how~ is everything, especially when you're a grandfather telling his granddaughter how he became King. King's Quest: A Knight to Remember builds its story on this narrative device, putting us in the shoes of an aging King Graham intent on narrating the own adventurous youth to little Gwendoline, occasionally spiced up the tale with a dash of exaggeration, a bit like Tim Burton's Big Fish. For younger players, we remind you that this title is a sort of remake of the historic King's Quest saga from Sierra, a point and click adventure born in the early 1980s from the mythological Roberta Williams and continued until 1998. A very long period in which through nine titles, not counting any conversions or remakes, is told the story of King Graham, his family, the kingdom of Daventry, how Graham will become King, when he challenged a dragon and how he raised and defended his enormous fortune . To lend him the voice we thought Christopher Lloyd, or the Doc of Back to the Future, who did a splendid job as regards the dubbing; fortunately all the other voices are also chosen with extreme care and perfectly tailored to their characters. At the moment the game is only in English, with subtitles in the same language. The charm of tradition This new edition is not placed directly in the timeline of the original game but rather wants to be a different way of telling Graham's adventure following a new point of view and a style that is halfway between the irony of LucasArts and the choices Telltale morals. In fact, A Knight to Remember abandons the traditional point and click structure, which in fact would have been too dated, for a very simple interface based on two buttons: one interacts with one, and with the other one searches one's inventory, in pure Grim Fandango style. Most of the time the setting is very classic: there are puzzles to be solved through dialogues or with one of the many objects that can be collected for the map and which initially may seem totally useless, such as wheels of stale bread or tools gardening tools that look like lethal weapons, but occasionally the rhythm is broken by small moments in which it becomes a shooter, Quick Time Events (very few, fortunately) and more lively sections in which you have to escape by avoiding objects or hiding like in a game stealth. The first few minutes are characterized by a minimalist narrative tone, in which the protagonist speaks very little and the game relies on the shots to suggest possible solutions to the puzzles. Right from the start it is possible to appreciate a design of the environment and of the characters that make the game look like a modern version of the adventures of Don Bluth, Dragons's Lair above all, or certain great Disney classics. A decidedly well-crafted artistic vision that remains top-notch from start to finish; but the best is yet to come. The great classic King's Quest returns with an adventure that you should definitely try! Crossroads, quotes and jokes In fact, after the prologue, we will not only have learned the rudiments of the control system and the resolution of the puzzles, but we will have reached our first crossroads within the plot. Avoiding spoilers, we can tell myself that we will have to resolve a critical situation by relying on our compassion, intelligence or strength. In doing so we will take a path that over the course of the episodes will change the continuation of the adventure in a more or less fundamental way and that we will only discover by continuing to play the next chapters. The game is littered with these little plot forks and we're honestly very curious as to where they'll take us. After the inInitial linearity of the first adventure, the approximately five hours of King's Quest: A Knight to Remember games flow smoothly like oil in a continuous succession of gags, puzzles and action moments mixed to perfection that make the title one of the funniest and relaxing to play of the last period. It's practically impossible not to laugh to discover how Graham participated in a tournament to become a knight of Daventry, thwarted by bizarre and unlikely opponents. The game is full of quotes and references to great classics of the fantastic such as The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, Beauty and the Beast and others that we spare you so as not to take away the taste of the surprise. A succession of winks that fortunately are diluted in the right way, without becoming excessive or turning into forced gags. Indeed we can say that we greatly appreciated the general tone of the work which, while offering very amusing moments, is also able to indulge in a few more emotionally intense moments. Free with PlayStation Plus King's Quest: A Knight to Remember is free this month for PlayStation Plus users. The Sony service, which costs around fifty euros for a twelve-month subscription, offers 24 games a year for PlayStation 4 and, also considering PlayStation 3 and Vita , the offer rises to about sixty titles. As a side dish, the Japanese giant offers its subscribers services such as cloud saving with 10GB of space, Share Play, PlayStation Plus Bonus and PlayStation Italian League tournaments. The importance of storytelling In particular, one cannot but love the way in which the developers have handled any deaths of the protagonist. Graham being alive and well it is evident that he cannot have died in that cave full of wolves we ventured into, therefore, in case we end up there, we will hear him say phrases like ~But of course I didn't really enter it, I'm not stupid~ while the game reloads the last checkpoint. Likewise these narrative techniques are used to spare the player some more boring moments. For example, when we have to cross a cliff for the second time by walking very slowly on a narrow walkway, we will hear the granddaughter complain that she does not want to hear that part again, and we will magically find ourselves on the other side. An elegant and useful move at the same time. To tell the truth, we have to admit that the game may be too simple for players particularly good at puzzles. Often it will be the narration itself that suggests the solution, both directly and verbally and indirectly, perhaps by focusing the shot on any useful objects. This does not mean that all the puzzles are easy on the contrary, compared to what has been seen in Telltale titles here a use of the brain is required that goes beyond choosing the right phrase or a click at the right time, however we are certainly not faced with a hardcore title. King's Quest: A Knight to Remember took us by surprise. It is an excellent graphic adventure that knows how to walk the line between the interactive story and the old point and click titles and is able to give moments of pure hilarity, embellished by an excellent narrative structure. Telltale will do well to be careful.", "date": "2015-12-11", "grade": null}
