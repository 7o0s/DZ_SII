In the case of KTX Software, the winning team of the last (literally, unfortunately) edition of Make Something Unreal, the step from the development of The Haunted: Hells Reach to its actual marketing on Steam was short. Too much. Driven by the powerful Unreal Engine 3, the game looks like a third person shooter that winks at scrolling fighting games, and that you can play both alone and in multiplayer, accessing cooperative or competitive modes. There is no real plot at the base of the events in which we are catapulted once one of the four available characters is selected (Bruce, Hector, Jacob and Caleb, different only in appearance and voice of the voice actor), but it is quite easy to assume that there has been a demonic invasion, to be faced obviously with guns blazing. Unfortunately, the appearance of the four heroes is not convincing at all, on the one hand due to the limits attributable to the immature design of a debuting team, on the other due to the at least stereotyped models: Bruce is a kind of soldier, Hector is a Hispanic who speaks like Duke Nukem, Jacob is a reverend with a hat and Caleb, finally, is bald and one-eyed. Not bad, after all once the game has started we will have little time to think about the appearance of our alter ego: the demonic hordes will surround us all the time, trying to hit us and chasing us anywhere on the eight maps present. From dusk to dawn There are four modes offered by The Haunted: Hells Reach. The first and most popular is called ~Inferno~ and can be played either alone or in collaboration with three other people. The concept behind this mode is simple and basically refers to the Horde of Gears of War: there are four huge waves of enemies to kill, after which you go down to hell to eliminate their evil instigator, a gigantic demon who spits fire. The ~Survival~ mode, which can also be played both in single and in co-op, instead consists of a single infinite horde, which we must try to survive as long as possible to set new duration records each time. Then there are two competitive modes, ~Battle~ and ~Demonizer~: the first sees four players take on the role of heroes and four others ~manage~ the demonic army, using the free camera to place their ~pawns~ on the maps until one of the two parties does not prevail over the other; the second part as a co-op but each player killed turns into a demon and therefore has the task of attacking their former companions. The analysis of the gameplay and modes must be done with a necessary premise: the first version of the game released on Steam suffered from major problems in terms of balancing difficulty and matchmaking. In the days immediately following its release, The Haunted was in fact such a difficult title that it was almost a source of pride, in contrast to the trends of recent years, capable of attracting hardcore gaming fanatics, with a steep learning curve like few (despite a fundamentally simple structure) and very long waiting times to enter the game, given the obligation to wait for the end of the current round. Fortunately, the (right) criticisms on the forums prompted the developers of KTX Software to release a patch that acts precisely on the major criticalities of the product, making the experience more accessible (the ~easy~ level is now effectively easy) and allowing new players to enter the game immediately. My name is Ash. Hardware department The most interesting thing about The Haunted: Hells Reach, in terms of gameplay, is the fusion between typically shooter mechanics and others that come from the tradition of scrolling fighting games. The four protagonists of the game have three different weapons (pistol, rifle and machine gun) and just work a little with the assignment of the keys to make the combat system very similar to that of the aforementioned Gears of War (also from Unreal Engine 3 it is, after all), better therefore if with the support of a controller for Xbox 360: the left trigger to aim, the right one to shoot, the pressure of the latter to use the dagger up close and the left one to run , the d-pad to scroll through weapons, the back buttons to dodge and use explosives and finally the main buttons to jump (A), strike (B), reload the weapon (X) and interact with the environment (Y ). Although opening fire comes in handy and very often it is essential, it is wrong to think that it is our only offensive resource, given the effectiveness of the maneuversand melee and the presence of quite a few spectacular combos: uppercut after a somersault, flying kick, sliding kick, roundhouse kick, ground punch and so on. Attacks that not only allow us to get rid of enemies quickly, without wasting bullets, but also to recover precious vital energy. The two hundred ~hit points~ at our disposal can in fact be restored only in two ways: by stunning the opponents and then finishing them off (with ample bloodshed) or by destroying the ~health stones~ that are revealed in some points of the map. Speaking of stones, at least two or three times during each ~round~ those of time will also appear, which we have the task of destroying quickly and whose arrival is ~announced~ by the interface with a certain gravity. The reason is obvious: if we don't destroy them within a few seconds, terrible calamities will be unleashed that can make life really difficult for us, between lightning storms and lava explosions. They come out of the fucking walls! We have mentioned how, after the patch, the ~easy~ level of the game has actually become easy and how before, however, even that represented an unlikely challenge for those who dared to try it. Observing the differences in the generation of enemies between before and after the ~cure~ unfortunately ends up making the paucity of the game even more evident in terms of strategic depth. Anyone who has tried the Horde mode of Gears of War or any level of Left 4 Dead knows that the concept of wave cannot be interpreted in a confusing way, projecting enemies in bulk on the map, often behind the players, with the aim of thereby raising the degree of challenge. We can assume that the developers of KTX Software wanted to distinguish their title from the experiences just mentioned, encouraging users to move continuously within the scenarios to escape the enemies that have just materialized around them, but equally it is an unglamorous and simplistic approach . Similarly, it would have been better to opt for fewer and more concise waves, rather than endless hordes of demons, and increase the number of them before the final confrontation. At first the artificial intelligence of the demons gives the impression of being very modest, then at least some interesting solutions emerge (see the enemies that we can't finish off and who get ~angry~, becoming more powerful), which also force us to exploit the explosive barrels scattered here and there. The monster design isn't gorgeous, but it still looks better than the heroes, and there's a decent variety of gruesome creatures to slay. The weapon upgrades are also good, which can be collected from killed opponents (such as ammunition) and allow us to transform the service pistol into a semi-automatic model or a revolver, the shotgun into a sawed-off shotgun or a military variant, the light machine gun in an assault rifle, and so on. Lastly, as far as the technical sector is concerned, the ~hard~ soundtrack well underlines the most agitated phases, the voices are truly stereotyped but elicit a few smiles, while in purely graphic terms there is a discreet use of the capabilities of the UE3, combined but to an artistic component that highlights the natural limits of a novice team.", "date": "2011-11-10", "grade": "7.0"}
