{"name": "Star Wars Jedi Starfighter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-jedi-starfighter-3.html", "text": "The plot The protagonist of this Star Wars Jedi Starfighter this time is a Jedi indeed a Jedi woman named Adi Gallia. Our heroine, at the helm of a brand new Starfighter prototype, depicted on the cover of the game, will have to deal with the fearsome Trade Federation which, as always, wastes no time in plotting terrible attacks on the entire galaxy. This time our goal will be the elimination of truno's bad guy, this Cavik Toth, who, not satisfied with the powerful means at his disposal, is looking for the ultimate weapon with which he intends to seize absolute power. To do this, he is ready to exterminate the inhabitants of Karthakk in order to test his new weapon. Fortunately, we will be able to count on a good number of allies, first of all the good old Nym, already known in the first chapter, who will accompany us during the various missions and of which we will be able to take on the role with relative change of spacecraft. The vehicles are not all the same and differ above all in maneuverability and armament. Just the armament, in Jedi Starfighter is an element that brings with it some new features, or rather some updates compared to the previous episode. For those who don't know yet, it is essentially a space shooter and the action always takes place on board very powerful ships, each equipped with a different fire and handling system. For example, Adi Gallia's ship is much more manageable than Nym's heavy and now old vehicle but, on the other hand, the firepower of the new Starfighter is visually lower than that of Nym's Havoc. As I said before, there are some new features, or rather some additions, in the armament of the spaceships: in fact, pressing the O key can now generate ~Force powers~, i.e. a series of attacks or defenses that can also be fundamental in the most hostile. In fact, we will be able to protect ourselves thanks to a powerful energy shield or launch deadly attacks thanks to the Lighting Force. Gameplay The game structure is almost identical to the previous chapter. The action is broken up into missions: about twenty divided into 3 acts, plus some of practice, very useful especially for those approaching the game for the first time and therefore need a little training. Once the series of exercises is finished, you can launch into the real game. Excellent cutscenes made in computer graphics divide the various missions from each other characterized by a series of objectives. Some of these are mandatory for the completion of the mission, while others are secondary and the achievement of these objectives will in some cases unlock hidden bonuses within the game, such as being able to face previously completed missions aboard a awesome X-Wing. What we will have to do in each mission is almost always the same thing, that is, to alternate attacks on more or less large objectives with phases of coverage of our forces. All this in the long run can be decidedly repetitive and considering the fact that the number of missions is not very high we arrive at one of the main flaws of the game which, like its predecessor, carries the defect of a low longevity. Despite this, however, the effort of the programmers in this sense is there and it shows: by completing a mission, we will in fact have the opportunity to replay it in the company of a friend in split screen mode. This is undoubtedly the most interesting novelty of this Star Wars Jedi Starfighter. In addition to being fun, the two-player mode always guarantees an excellent reason to repeat previously completed missions. Check The control system is very convincing. It practically takes up the same functions as the first chapter and guarantees almost total control. With the two analog levers we will manage the movement of the spaceships, the directional cross is used instead to select the powers of the Force and assign tasks to our companions such as coverage of allies, assignment of a goal and so on. The classic keys, on the other hand, are used for weapons and targeting enemies, while the back keys are assigned the functions of braking, acceleration and the very comfortable zoom function, with which we will be able to aim at targets otherwise not visible to the naked eye. Graphics Graphically, Star Wars Jedi Starfighter certainly does not do the same effeat that Star Wars Starfighter did about a year ago, despite the fact that many improvements have been made. The main problem, although not particularly annoying, is the same as its predecessor. In fact, the game continues to experience some frame rate drops in the most chaotic situations. As long as the missions take place in space, no problem, everything travels perfectly, but the fluidity problems are noticed instead in low-altitude missions and in particular during sharp turns and after strong explosions. Nothing really serious, but certainly a little bitterness in the mouth remains, given that Star Wars Jedi Starfighter represents a sequel and as such shouldn't bring the flaws of the prequel. Frame rate aside, the improvements can be seen in the textures which, although flat, are now decidedly more refined and varied than in the past. The terrestrial settings are truly beautiful, characterized by very well done mountain ranges and very convincing colors. All this to say that graphically the game is not bad and is quite pleasant to look at, despite this, Star Wars Jedi Starfighter decisively loses in the inevitable comparison with Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader by Factor 5 for GameCube, currently considered the best game to demonstrate the graphics potential of the Nintendo console. But certainly more could not be expected since Star Wars Jedi Starfighter was not born with these pretensions. Sound The soundtrack, as in the style of LucasArts, represents one of the strong points of the game. The music, in perfect cinematic style, helps to immerse ourselves perfectly in the game. The voice acting of the characters is also good. Star Wars Jedi Starfighter is in fact completely translated into Italian, including speech, present not only in the CG movies but also in most of the game sessions. Conclusions The main novelty of Star Wars Jedi Starfighter is represented by the interesting two-player mode, otherwise the game does not differ much from its predecessor resulting in the end a missed opportunity. Unfortunately the main defects such as poor longevity and a slight repetitiveness have not been completely resolved. Despite this, the game is very entertaining and a true fan of the Star Wars saga shouldn't let it get away. In fact, due to the few innovations, those who already have the first chapter could very well aim for something else, while those who besides a PS2 also own a GameCube will most likely not have even read this review! Pros: Excellent control system 2 player mode Splendid music Definitely playable Cons: Inconsistent frame rate Too similar to its predecessor Poor longevity A bit repetitive A world made of Episodes About a year ago, the first LucasArts work inspired by the film Episode I: The Phantom Menace, entitled Star Wars Starfighter, arrived on PlayStation 2. While the film grossed billions at the box office around the world, the video game, which was placed in the shooter / flight simulator genre, was enjoying some success, revealing itself as one of the first titles to worthily exploit the characteristics of the Sony console, which at the time did not offer lots of choice. Both in terms of playability and technical quality, the game had convinced us almost completely if it weren't for some indecisions in the graphics engine, which accused slight drops in frame rate in the most crowded situations, and above all due to a longevity not at the highest levels . With the upcoming release in cinemas of Episode II: Attack of the Clones, LucasArts certainly could not miss the appointment with a new game for PlayStation 2 that follows in the footsteps of the excellent first chapter, but which in any case, offers novelties and improvements worthy to justify the purchase. And so here is Star Wars Jedi Starfighter ready even before the release of the film by George Lucas. The main points on which the developers should have committed their greatest efforts concerned: an enhancement of the graphics engine both to offer a title in step with the times and to avoid the annoying drops in frame rate, a wider variety in the missions and a greater longevity. As we will see in this review, not all promises have been kept, despite the fact that there is no shortage of news.", "date": "2002-05-13", "grade": null}
