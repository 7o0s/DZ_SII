Usually the approach to a good third-person action adventure, or a fast-paced adventure, requires a pair of headphones and a ~do not disturb~ sign posted on the living room door. Nobody forbids the presence of a multiplayer mode to devote to once the main story is over. But precisely: the plot and the multiplayer sector remain perfectly distinguishable, separated from each other. Far Cry 4 has taught us that this distinction is not so clear-cut, and that a narrative lived in two has its why. Josef Fares (the father of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons) has instead experimented with a different, even more extreme path: an experience that is impossible to play alone, a title that requires the presence of Player Two next to us at all times. Even virtually, through the online sector. A Way Out, published by EA, fulfills Fares' dream: the idea of a dynamic adventure designed to be played in pairs, from start to finish. And it clearly demonstrates that it works, at the price of some small details that are less convincing than the others. The escape route In the initial game menu it is possible to select whether A Way Out will be played locally or via the online cooperative mode. We completed the adventure with a family member physically present next to us from start to finish, but we also tried to invite an online friend to our game session. In fact, EA has seen fit to give those who own the game the opportunity to allow anyone on their friends list to enter the game, without necessarily being forced to buy it in turn: an important point in favor. Before starting the narrative from scratch, or picking it up from any of the already unlocked chapters, players can choose who of the two will play Leo, and who instead Vincent. They are the protagonists of A Way Out. Detained in a maximum security prison in America in the 70s, they were thrown in for different reasons. Let's be clear: they are not the classic positive heroes we would expect. Leo and Vincent have a criminal record behind them, but not such as to justify their imprisonment in such a maximum security facility. Continuing in the narrative we therefore learn that in reality they were both framed by a third criminal, much more dangerous than the two of them put together. Leo and Vincent, who initially don't know each other, will gradually make friends during the initial stages of the adventure, until they plan together the great escape... and then the due revenge. The narration of A Way Out is that of a good thriller: exploratory phases alternate with others characterized by action, clashes and frenetic racing, keeping interest in the plot high until its conclusion. The basic idea is to allow players to continue without too many problems, but the level of difficulty is one of the few aspects of the production that failed to convince us. There are no more or less complex modes, and most of the situations in the title can simply be solved with simple reasoning, trivial trial and error mechanics, or by sharpening the eye. This path was probably chosen to really allow any couple to complete the title, given that most of the efforts will be used to be able to coordinate even in the most agitated situations. Aside from the level of difficulty, however, A Way Out is a fresh, original and fun title. The developers said in an interview that we would never have faced the same situation twice, but in reality the basic mechanics are always the same: you explore the game environment by interacting with secondary characters, who from time to time so they give us some useful advice, you interact with objects via Square and end the action in progress with Circle. It is above all the stealth phases that are repeated in a similar way, but it is also true that variety has been sought almost at all times, thinking about what interesting ideas a certain environment could offer and what instead would have been ~already seen~ results. The title of Fares is a huge cauldron of ideas: over the course of the approximately six hours required to complete the adventure, we found ourselves doing a little bit of everything. We hid in a prison laundry cart while Leo hauled us out unrecognized; armed with crutches we launched ourselves on a taut cable to move from one building to another, like in the best action movies; we fished with a spear, lit a fire and played the banjo activating a real Guitar Hero minigame. There are many small details that enrich the pleasure of the scopsteep, and at the same time enhance the variety of situations offered by the title. Playstation 4 trophies For trophy hunters A Way Out is a feast for the eyes, offering 10 Gold, 4 Silver and the coveted Platinum trophies. Nothing too difficult on the horizon, but to unlock them you will have to interact with certain objects scattered around the game world. Each trophy is linked to the completion of a specific action, or to the activation of a specific mini-game, one more opportunity to unearth all the little secrets hidden here and there by the developers. If you miss something, it's not the end of the world: there's ~chapter selection~ in the game menu. Coordination is everything Maybe you are thinking: ~I activate the second Dualshock controller and enjoy the adventure of A Way Out alone~. After all, in many games the presence of the second player is simply an ~extra~, when in reality the action can be carried out simply by only one of the two. A Way Out doesn't work like this: coordination is essential, and a friend physically present in the room can really make the difference compared to one online. Because you can talk to each other, you can establish an action plan, and you can implement it, all with extreme immediacy. A Way Out, in every aspect, is designed to make us collaborate. There's a tool on that table that we could use to escape, but it's being guarded by guards. Then Leo can attract them under any pretext, perhaps simply by complaining of a headache; meanwhile Vincent can sneak up to the table and steal the item. This is the simplest situation: there are others that require quicker reflexes. For example, out of the blue, a cutscene can introduce a frisk, and then you have to quickly pass a screwdriver, without being seen. The stealth phases are the most reasoned ones, and allow a series of different approaches. We can hide during the escape in the tall grass, from start to finish, avoiding the beams of light. Or, if we're more practical, knock out the guards one by one and walk tall. The save points are extremely generous, and the artificial intelligence is not that smart: we have already said it, we would have preferred a few more stimuli. The real fistfights, inside and outside the prison, follow the QTE mechanics: at the right moment we have to execute the commands on the screen, otherwise we will see a movie in which we are knocked down and we will have to start over. We have not highlighted particular defects in A Way Out: the title convinced us, proving to be fun, at times exciting, and still offering an original experience. The limitations are mainly due to the (necessary) presence of the split-screen. You get used to the view, but in order not to miss anything of what is happening on the screen, sometimes you risk becoming cross-eyed to look at both us and the other protagonist at the same time. Because very often Leo and Vincent are not even in the same room, especially during the initial stages. It certainly doesn't help that the title is subtitled in Italian, but not dubbed: imagine having to read the dialogues between the two supporting actors, when the jokes of each of them are displayed on their game screen. If we play Vincent, we'll have to shift our gaze now to our window, now to Leo's when it's his turn to speak, in an often frustrating crescendo. Also because the dialogues greatly enrich a dynamic adventure like A Way Out, provide background and characterize the characters. The way in which the player screens turn into horizontal rectangles at the time of the cutscenes and cinematics is not even too convincing. When they merge into a single window that's just fine: they are the most important moments of the plot. But when one remains in vertical split screen and the other becomes horizontal, it is certainly not a pretty sight.", "date": "2018-03-22", "grade": "8.2"}
