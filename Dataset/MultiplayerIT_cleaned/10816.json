{"name": "Disney: Pensa In Fretta - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/disney-pensa-in-fretta-recensione.html", "text": "By now cleared through customs, mass-produced, multi-target, for everyone, video games face the market with a diversification that would have been unthinkable just five years ago. Wii is certainly the console that best interprets this new philosophy, this openness to the whole family, from the oldest to the youngest. In this context, Disney's ~Think Fast~ is completely at ease. The title takes a little from Trivial Pursuit, a little from Buzz, a little from ~Who Wants to Be a Millionaire~ and a little from the many television and non-television quizzes. The hypothetical TV program in which we are the protagonists is hosted by the legendary Genius of the Lamp from the film Aladdin and the settings are the classic ones of the even more legendary cartoon films of Uncle Walt's factory! As a good conductor, the Genius makes jokes, introduces the rounds, asks questions, launches videos and shows photographs. We instead impersonate one of the many characters created by brilliant authors in recent decades. From Mickey Mouse to Amelia, from Donald Duck to Minnie we find almost all the original voice actors to give voice to beautiful medium-animated polygonal characters. Not that they have to do much, really, other than cheer or make funny faces, they're still very similar to today's - but grant us very uninspired - 3D puppets that are rampant on national TVs in the morning. The title is therefore based on a good amount of quizzes and questions. The way they are placed or lead to score is different depending on the type of ~minigame~. There are the classic multiple answers, the choice between only two possibilities, the series of questions concerning a single feature film or the rounds where whoever is wrong loses points. To differentiate the action, we have also tried to include very simple, and rare, mini-games, especially suitable for the little ones, such as trying to score a basket with a ball after having appropriately loaded a bar, or choosing the intruder in a series of figures. Further variety is given by the questions posed on certain films, among other things well compressed, photos or drawings that are gradually revealed or drawn and by the presence of questions external to the world of films. Everything is therefore designed to make the title less boring and repetitive by always posing different difficulties, but still very clear and truly within everyone's reach. Although, of course, the play structure is strongly oriented towards children, the game manages to please and interest even the older ones. What makes the product suitable for the whole family is above all the fact that practically all the great films are treated, starting from Snow White through the Little Mermaid, 101 Dalmatians, the Lion King, arriving at the latest blockbusters such as Lilo and Stitch or Chicken Little. This obviously allows adults who grew up on bread and Mickey Mouse to face each other - I know there are many of us - and children with the entire DVD collection at home! In fact, the questions are well structured and go from the most obvious to the decidedly more specific and complex ones. Obviously the game doesn't make much sense if played alone, but it is a good way to spend an evening with passionate friends or with grandchildren or children. In this case the typical fun of this type of trivial game is well present and the challenge can become exciting even if obviously very good-natured! One criticism that could be made is dictated by the total lack of references to the world of comics, but this would have meant having to differentiate too clearly the products for each individual country, given that for years now, only some nations, including lucky Italy, they carry on the paper product.", "date": "2009-03-18", "grade": "S.V."}
