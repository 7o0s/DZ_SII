{"name": "Recensione Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-midnight-club-3-dub-edition.html", "text": "On closer inspection, NFSU2 presents more options and greater completeness as regards the modifications to the engine, to the other internal components and in general to the purely performance parameters of the modifications made. But if instead we look at the quantity and variety of changes to the car's aesthetics, the MC3 is truly unrivalled. We've already covered this extensively in previous previews, which have followed part of the game's development process, so suffice it to say that however you whip your mind to customize your Mezzo, Midnight Club 3 will provide you with enough variations on the theme to leave you spoiled for choice. And Dub Magazine's sponsorship has brought enough official brands to make you forget about pasting windshield stickers from invented tire manufacturers. ...the three cities of San Diego, Atlanta and Detroit have to experience really busy nights to be remotely comparable to the life that animates their virtual counterparts. But no more jokes and let's get back to the actual game: what else did the guys at Rockstar San Diego bet on? We have damn fast and unquestionably fun gameplay, but that's for granted. What actually amazes and can, according to taste, attract or leave dumbfounded, is the abundance of ~action~ in the immense scenarios in which the competitions take place. As you know the races take place in open scenarios, and the three cities of San Diego, Atlanta and Detroit have to experience really busy nights to be remotely comparable to the life that animates their virtual counterparts. The number of vehicles on the screen is unprecedented, and although some elements such as passing trams behave like scripted events, everything else seems to move breathing the chaos of a metropolis, a huge hive of fervent activity, where we are just bees a a little crazier than the others. Once the confusion caused by the lack of constraints on our routes has been overcome, from the point of view of personal satisfaction, speeding around at full speed avoiding ~civil~ cars becomes almost more important than arriving first at the finish line. This, together with the characteristic driving style, full of exploits and special moves, makes the MC3 gamepley extremely personal, especially when compared to the average arcade title, which often boils down to a trivial dosage of the accelerator to make predictable curves while avoiding the others competitors and the occasional van. Speaking of special moves, from the beginning of the game we have all those included in the previous chapter available, which allow us to run balanced on two wheels, make quick starts, control the attitude of the car during the incredible jumps and so on. Street. There are also three new unlockables, each usable only with certain types of vehicles. These are Ariete, Zona and Furia, which respectively allow for a few moments to sweep away opponents and obstacles as if they were straws, slow down time allowing for faster and safer driving and make traffic escape away from our trajectory. Extremely fun to use alone, earning their use becomes equally rewarding in terms of play during online sessions. The single-player game mode offers a considerable range of different challenges that should commit enough even beyond the nominal 18 hours. Perhaps the most valuable thing in this case is the overall balance. An immediate game to master does not necessarily mean easy, and MC3 has the advantage of offering both an absolutely non-demanding learning curve and a level of difficulty that increases equally gradually, without sudden spikes that can lead to discouragement or frustration. Unfolding along the three aforementioned cities, the Career mode offers competitions belonging to the following categories: City races, Club races, Tournaments and ~Road Drivers~. Each offers challenges of a different nature and difficulty, as well as different types of rewards, from money, to new cars, to unlocking new cities or special moves. At any moment in the game you always have more than a single option to move forward, so getting stuck is not something to fear. Furthermore, the method of selecting the races (a sort of citizen free mode similar to that of NFS Underground 2) represents in itself a significant portion of the game, not only because it allows you to learn the details of the city topography, but encourages exploration with a whole series of bonuses and secret objectives to find. However valuable from a general point of view, MC3 cannot be said to be the fastest titleoce, much less the most beautiful to look at, in its category. The engine is solid and squeezes the potential of the two consoles properly, but the fact remains that even in the best conditions it remains solidly anchored to 30 frames per second. Justifiable, considering the abundance of moving objects and the considerable size of the scenarios, but it is not a negligible detail in an arcade title of this mold, especially as the further slowdowns that affect the Ps2 version take over. In fact, although on both systems the performances are almost similar, the Sony console appears slightly in trouble during the most agitated phases. In any case, the rendering on the screen is roughly the same, slightly sharper and more defined on Xbox, both cases more than positive, despite the textures of many objects and some of the backgrounds do not do justice to those of cars and other elements main of the game. Comment Midnight Club 3 hits the bull's-eye as ~the arcadeiest of arcades,~ rivaling Burnout 3 in no-holds-barred furious racing. The excellent ideas of aesthetics and playability remain slightly limited by a technical sector that is not in a workmanlike manner and by a certain tendency to confuse the player (the chaotic traffic and the nocturnal setting all too dotted with lights and trails of lanterns and lampposts will create some problems), but these are minor defects when compared to the abundance of content or the potential of multiplayer, extremely well thought out and reliable thanks to some tricks such as host migration. Thumbs up and kudos to Rockstar. Pros: Playable and fun Lots of cars and licenses Great soundtrack Multiplayer to try Cons: Technically we've seen better A bit confusing Midnight rides It certainly cannot be said that Midnight Club 3 wanted to hit the shelves quickly and indeed we can say that it took it rather easy. After all, last season was literally dotted with arcade racing games that all came out within a few weeks of each other, so why bother competing for a slice of the market when you can have it all by simply waiting a few more months? Midnight Club 3 is not the last scion of a very prestigious series, but this third installment Rockstar wanted to take the franchise seriously and make it make the leap in quality, moving from an honest arcade without licenses, with approximate characters and a personal but unoriginal game mechanic, to a title of considerable depth, with over 50 official vehicles, tons of game modes and a complete and fulfilling online experience. Without forgetting the much-vaunted car modification and customization system. Developed in San Diego, a Mecca for much of the tuning subculture of the States, MC3 starts from the assumptions set by NFS Underground, expanding them in its own way to make this mode the most in-depth ever seen in a video game, or almost.", "date": "2005-04-28", "grade": null}
