It is a mobile app that uses augmented reality, distributed with the free-to-play formula and which therefore must be subject to a whole series of rules in order to recoup the investment. Accepting that it is a commercial product of a certain type remains the first step in not attributing blame or merits that it does not have. For example, let's start with the choice of the starter. We agree one hundred percent with what was said in the test a few days ago, regarding the betrayal of an important part of the soul of classic games when the app forces us to relegate our first Pokmon to a simple ornament. The mechanism by which pokmon grow and evolve (we'll talk about it later) makes our Squirtle with eleven Fight Points useless, even more so if even before being able to challenge the gyms ten times more powerful pokmon arrive in the team. The initial choice is thus reduced to a tutorial on catching and a simple quote to pamper the fans. It creates wrong expectations and, perhaps, it would have been better to avoid it altogether. But let's also think about what would have happened with a super upgradeable starter. In practice Pokmon GO would have risked turning into one of those games where only one pokmon is ever used, while the others are kept in the team only to make up the number. Not exactly the best for a game of this type. It is therefore welcome to push to always capture new little monsters in search of the one most suitable for the fight. Even seeing it this way, however, the mechanism remains far from perfect. It's official: Pokmon GO is finally available and this is our verdict on the phenomenon of the summer! The shaky start of a new adventure As is probably already very well known, given that more or less everyone has found a way to download the app before the official release in Italy, there are no fights against the other real trainers or against the wild pokmon you meet walking through the streets of our world. Thus the capture takes place in ways similar to those of the classic game safaris: you aim and with your finger you throw a ball, or a bait; then hopefully all goes well. Their growth then takes place through two resources: stardust, which is obtained from all game actions, and candies, which are specific to each pokmon and are obtained by capturing them, transferring them to Professor Willow (but thus losing possession) and, above all, by hatching the eggs. To improve the fight points you need a candy and a certain amount of powder, while for the evolution a certain number of candies is required. In short, no stones or strange mechanisms: to have strong pokmon you have to capture as many pokmon as possible, accumulate experience with game actions to increase your trainer level and decide when and on which little monsters to invest your resources. A simple system and, given that the candies resemble rare candies, acceptable even by the most intransigent fans. However, there are problems and the most serious is the intermittent diffusion of pokmon, with some areas covered by dozens of different monsters and others simply isolated. The unfortunate people who live in rural areas thus find themselves dealing with a ridiculous frequency of pokmon appearances, but even between the different districts of the same city the disparity is evident. The promise to adapt the pokmon's habitat to the real environment was then largely disregarded, with Zubat infestations at any time of day, even if they can't stand sunlight; the banks of the rivers, then, are often devoid of water pokmon or completely deserted. The GPS tracking system itself is far from perfect and reaching a pokmon ends up being too many times impossible. In short, those who do not live in cities cannot grow in any way and find themselves cut off from both hunting and competition. In-app purchases The issue of in-app purchases is always thorny and it is difficult to predict how the game will evolve in the future. The good news is that we have not yet felt the need to invest real money in game coins: for the moment, therefore, the risk of pay-to-win seems to have been avoided. There is only one Gym Leader! While waiting for Niantic to deliver on its promise to add trades and battles between trainers, there is only one way to compete with others in Pokmon GO: by challenging Pokmon Gyms. Their operation is a simplified variant of what already happened in Ingress, a title created by the developers themselves and from which the locations of the gyms and points of interest scattered around the world have been imported, the so-called PokStops with which to interact to obtain tools and eggs .The goal of the players, divided into three teams, is to occupy as many gyms as possible with their pokmon and, if the gym is free, the coach can claim it for the team and choose a pokmon as defender. At that point, two scenarios can occur. The first is that a trainer from the same team passes into the area, to put another pokmon in defense, if there is space, or to start a friendly match to increase its prestige and the number of defenders. If the player belongs to the rival team, however, the attempt to conquer starts. The fights are simple and do not require the presence of all the coaches involved: the defenders are in fact controlled by artificial intelligence, while the offensive phase is managed in real time by the players, who can also support each other with simultaneous attacks. A system of this type, which is based on the combination of basic attacks, charged special attack and dodging via the touch screen, is in our opinion perfect for Pokmon GO because, at least on paper, it ensures that the battles are short, the competition always alive and the experience accessible even to those who do not have great experience with video games. There is also not even a small strategic component, based on the weaknesses and resistances of the pokmon, on their speed and on their amount of Health Points. The community seems to be organizing well and even in Italy it happens more and more often to come across groups of kids who go around looking for pokmon and gyms, without worrying too much about the weather or fatigue. If our cities are more alive than ever this summer, it is in fact right to give much of the credit to Pokmon GO. However, it is difficult to imagine that the conquest of the gyms alone could keep attention so high for a long time and we hope soon the organization of themed events or the inclusion of secondary missions, which can give a purpose even to those who get tired of doing a simple stroll downtown. Furthermore, those who started playing in conjunction with the official launch risk being cut out of the competition altogether, given that they find themselves dealing with pokmon with thousands of fight points more than their own. Finally, we conclude with a few words on the technical sector, which in recent days has certainly not been talked about for the excellent care in the models and animations of the pokmon. Instead, it is the servers that have attracted attention with their many problems and have slowed down the release of Pokmon GO in different parts of the world. Now it seems that the situation is slowly stabilizing and we are confident that as the days go by bugs, app blocks and also the GPS location problems of pokmon and trainers will be resolved.", "date": "2016-07-16", "grade": "7.0"}
