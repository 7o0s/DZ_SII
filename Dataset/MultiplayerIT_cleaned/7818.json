Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. From August 21 in Italian cinemas, ~Turbo~ is the new animated film made by DreamWorks and tells the story of a snail with an unusual passion for speed which, due to an accident, comes into contact with the NOS than a racing car and suddenly becomes very fast. At that point he exploits his new ability in a series of fun ~illegal races~ between snails, and this is precisely the central theme of Turbo Racing League, the tie-in for iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices created by PikPok. The game can be downloaded for free and offers four different ~leagues~, accessible however only after having collected a certain number of stars and having simultaneously passed a final tournament. It is precisely the quantity that is the most convincing element of this title, which provides nine different tracks and four stipulations to increase the degree of variety of the experience, all net of an upgrade system that allows us to buy new components for our shell using the fruits collected on the track and obtained with any victories. The freemium dynamics are expressed in the possibility of buying fruit packs and thus obtaining extra power-ups more quickly, but the more advanced stages can also be accessed without spending real money, simply by repeating events to scrape together the nest egg necessary to obtain the speed that we need it to be competitive. Brave snails The Turbo Racing League control system features various configurations, based on the touch screen or the accelerometer. The most convincing in terms of precision and responsiveness sees us act on the two halves of the screen to turn left or right, with multiple touches to perform drifts useful for not losing momentum. In fact, since these are races between snails, the developers have seen fit to base the races on inertia rather than on the ability of the tiny animals to boast real propulsion, and so at the start you have to ~launch~ your snail by giving it the greatest possible cue , then on the track locate the acceleration ramps and drive over them to get extra boost. Ramps also play a very important role, especially in ~one-on-one~ races, which not only face each other at great speed but more often than not act as a shortcut to the normal structure of the circuit. Being able to follow them often proves to be the key to overtaking that seemed impossible to us. The respectable numbers of this production are supported by a technical sector of excellence that manages to bring an enormous amount of objects to the screen of our mobile device and to keep the frame rate high, apart from some difficult situations. The tracks therefore appear ~alive~, very colorful and full of details. Turbo Racing League is a tie-in of surprising quality, which focuses above all on numbers", "date": "2013-05-25", "grade": "7.8"}
