The game is an independent title, with a duration of less than seven hours and sold at a fairly negligible price on Steam, yet it is a small pearl. Those who know the guys at Amanita Design probably know what to expect from a title like Samorost 3, but who doesn't know the series or the development team? Read on for our review to find out about this delightful game. Samorost 3 is the latest effort by the Amanita Design team: how will they get away with it? An object from space The plot of Samorost is a small fairy tale, which opens with the arrival of a mysterious object on the planet where the protagonist lives: suddenly, a strange horn falls from the sky, right in front of our door. This horn is the pivot of the adventure, because it will allow the protagonist to amplify the sounds of the surrounding environment and at the same time play melodies capable of reawakening the essence of things. Said like this it may seem a bit strange but we can assure you that we are not referring to any ~new age~ mystical practice: it is complex to explain some mechanisms of Samorost in exact words, mainly because throughout the game you will never find a written word or pronounced. No subtitles, no menus and no dubbing. The strength of the game is being able to communicate everything needed to progress in the adventure only through signs, symbols and drawings; a very strong narrative choice that demonstrates how powerful the language of video games can be without making use of the aid of a written and spoken language. What we should do will be explained to us with gestures or told through these famous essences we were talking about earlier, which will mimic the solution of some puzzles. The guys from Amanita have been able to kill the famous two birds with one stone because, in addition to demonstrating their great game design skills, they have removed the very boring hassle of translating the game into various different languages. In this way the game is understandable to everyone, regardless of the language spoken or reference alphabet. Before delving into the game mechanisms, a quick overview of the controls and the game system. The Golden Ibex The title, being a point and click, has a very dry command interface where, as you can well imagine, the exclusive use of the mouse is foreseen: left button to interact with objects, pressure of the left button plus movement of the mouse to see the whole game scheme on the screen and wheel to zoom. Even the game menu (the star at the top right) follows the same principle of ~no writing~ but still manages to be effective and understandable. It consists of six keys: starting from the right we find the classic mechanical wheel of the game options, which in turn contain audio, screen, acknowledgments (the only screen where letters and words appear) and the key to exit the game. Continuing we find saving, loading, illustrated books, trophies and the notebook with seal. The last two elements deserve a little more clarification. The trophies are the unlockable rewards that will be assigned to us when we discover a secret contained in the game, but there's more: each trophy is in fact a small musical track, usually dedicated to an instrument such as flute and percussion, which we will be able to play as many times as we want. The more trophies we have, the more audio tracks we can reproduce, even simultaneously, thus creating an ever more harmonious and complete melody. The sealed notebook instead we will be able to open it only after having completed at least two diagrams of the planet in which we find ourselves; once done, it will be enough to align the red dots of the seal and thus open the book, which will show us the illustrations of the schemes just solved. It looks like a painting If we wanted to compare Samorost 3 to a painting, probably the most suitable is ~The Garden of Earthly Delights~ painted by Hieronymus Bosch at the turn of the 1400s and 1500s. If you know the painting, you understand the reason for the comparison: a colorful and extravagant imagery, composed by a multitude of details that as a whole enchant but which taken individually are decidedly peculiar, not to mention grotesque at times. Artistically speaking, Samorost is exactly like this: you can lose yourself for hours and hours analyzing all the individual details of the levels, and then come across a detail that will leave you perplexed. Each planet has a strong identity but all are united by the artistic leitmotifs dear to the developers, such as the presence of waste or broken materials and the strong inspiration of some microc scenariososmosis visible only under the microscope (some planets or satellites in fact resemble mites, spores and other small life forms not visible to the naked eye). But continually feasting your eyes scenario after scenario is not a pleasure in itself because meticulous observation of the level is an integral part of the gameplay, as with any self-respecting graphic adventure. Each scene is therefore made up of objects with which to interact to progress in the game or for the simple sake of doing so, and often the complexity will be figuring out which elements you really need to continue... advice: don't try to make sense to every single action because very often the meaning is not there. You'll just do it, without wondering why, so save your wits for puzzles. The full-bodied part of the game is in fact represented by the puzzles, not excessively complex but which we still need to reflect on: as we said, the game communicates with us without using a spoken or written language, therefore even before approaching a puzzle and understanding its solution we will have to understand why it is necessary to do it and sometimes it will not always be so obvious. The puzzles themselves are also very fun and original, often based on the composition and decomposition of objects or logical passages but always proposed in a fresh and fun way, even if during the adventure we have not noticed a progressive increase in difficulty. The only negative note of the game is the slowness of some animations, which make navigating the scenarios boring at times, especially when it will be necessary to go back and forth a few times to solve the schemes. The rhythm in the blood The Samorost experience cannot be described without talking about the music, masterfully declined in every possible form. We have never forgotten that the Amanita boys are good from this point of view and even in their latest effort they do not deny themselves at all. The accompanying soundtrack is inspired and melodious, the sound effects are of great quality and particularly expressive but what is striking is the way in which all this is closely related to the gameplay. The game forces us to sharpen our eyes and listen carefully because often the intuition for solving the puzzles is actually conveyed by the music: it is therefore no coincidence that the main object at our disposal during the game is a musical instrument! It is very pleasant to note how the entire audio-game sector is based on the concept of progression, because the more you evolve in the level, the richer the soundtrack will be and also the puzzles very often adopt the layering mechanism of the tracks, just in the same way it is done with collectible trophies. Conceptually it is a bit the essence of the whole game, that is to add one more element little by little which, adding up with the previous ones, gives life to a constantly evolving harmony.", "date": "2016-04-03", "grade": "9.0"}
