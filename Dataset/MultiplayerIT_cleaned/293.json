{"name": "Blitzkrieg 2: Fall of the Reich - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blitzkrieg-2-fall-of-the-reich-recensione.html", "text": "The last days of WWII As can also be guessed from the title, Blitzkrieg 2: Fall of the Reich narrates the events of the last period lived on the Eastern Front in the spring of 1945, when the Germans, now on the verge of being defeated, tried to protect their territories from the advance of Russian forces , ready to march on Berlin. Our role will be precisely to lead the soldiers of both sides, in two distinct campaigns, trying to get the better of it even at the cost of solving the conflict in a different way than what happened historically. The briefings that precede each scenario are exhaustive and play the double role of introducing the historical-political dynamics and showing the objectives to be achieved. The action takes place in a rather intuitive and drumming way, the absence of resource management streamlines the interface and leaves the user with a certain freedom of action but significantly raises the pace, forcing you to think quickly. Once each assigned task has been completed, you will be able to receive a certain number of reinforcements that will be chosen from a range of possibilities that includes land, water and air vehicles, depending on the map, the situation and the difficulty selected. The variety of objectives is great, not only the defense or attack on outposts therefore, but also the coverage of certain roads to favor the advance of the allies, the achievement of buildings in which to find supplies and more. At the end of each game session then, we will be able to assign skill points which will vary according to the results achieved and will be useful for enhancing the units and generals, giving them new skills. This last element, while not creating a real ~role~ system, is very interesting given that it will be up to the player to decide which skills to assign to the individual elements of his army, based on the way he faces battles and the tactics he use most. Multiplayer, via LAN or Internet, allows challenges of up to 8 players at the same time but fails to satisfy due to the few available modes, all aimed at a simple fight to the death and not characterized by the variety of objectives that the single player experience instead manages to guarantee; in this respect some further improvements would have been expected. For modders, a fairly complete editor has been available for some time, not so much from the point of view of modeling the territories, but rather for the guaranteed freedom in positioning enemies and the tasks to be performed. The controls are quite simple: the screen is not overloaded with buttons and bars, and the only lack concerns the possibility of deploying our troops with a certain formation. For all those who have already played Blitzkrieg II, this expansion will therefore be greatly appreciated: the solid structure of the gameplay described above is added to a more articulated level design than in the past and the addition of half a dozen new units, all actually used by the factions involved. Instead, due to a not excessive longevity, about seven hours to conclude each of the two campaigns, and the tendency to take for granted some knowledge that the tutorial does not guarantee, those approaching this series for the first time may not enjoy a completely fulfilling experience. The weight of the years Technically, the game takes full advantage of the work done for Blitzkrieg 2, now more than a year old and not up to par with the most recent productions. The graphics use a 3D engine capable of moving dozens of units simultaneously, without any slowdown and with credible animations; the problems are revealed rather with not very detailed textures, the color palette a bit dull and above all in the fixed camera: it is possible to zoom but not rotate the view. The sound manages to be more convincing, the music is well suited to the drama of the battles reproduced and the effects also realistically reproduce the sounds of weapons and vehicles. The artificial intelligence is rather disappointing, with the allied soldiers unable to slavishly execute our commands without getting stuck in some obstacle and going beyond the pre-set point, while the enemies seem anchored to their positions: forget about their cover or retreat movements . The physics, on the other hand, are good: the buildings are destroyed under your blows and the trees fall as the crawlers pass, guaranteeing a greater sensation of realism and making the action spectacular. The hardware requests are not excessive, Pentium IV 2.4 GHz with 512 MB of Ram and a 128 MB of VRAM video card, are enough to run the game very well. Encyclopedia Thehistory lovers will be happy to know that within the game there is a rich archive of all the heavy artillery and vehicles present, copies of those that fought in the Second World War. Each sheet, which can be selected via a search engine that divides the entries by country and type of vehicle, displays the main technical characteristics, some curiosities and the use made of them. It is thus possible to obtain important advice on how to make the most of each individual resource. Conclusions The attempt to create an expansion that is attractive both for those who have already played the previous chapter and for all those who are beginners, only partially succeeds in the development team. The gameplay is solid and proves to be fun, but elements such as longevity, AI and multiplayer leave a bad taste in the mouth on several occasions. Even technically, the decision not to renew the graphics sector does not fully satisfy, too far from what we are now used to seeing. Lovers of the series will like it, for all the others at least one try would be a must so as not to regret it later. Elements such as A.I. and multiplayer have remained unchanged from the past Technically a bit obsolete Blitzkrieg for everyone Blitzkrieg 2: Fall of the Reich, continuation of one of the most popular real-time strategy games of 2005, offers a formula that is quite popular in the last period: create stand-alone expansions that are playable even if you don't have the original campaign. This choice, in the face of a possible greater commercial return, imposes a certain number of risks, above all related to balancing the proposed challenge which must not be frustrating for newbies and boring for the more experienced. For those approaching the strategy developed by Nival Interactive for the first time, a brief introductory overview is therefore useful. The points of greatest interest characteristic of the series are a faithful and detailed historical reconstruction, which includes careful planning of the missions, and the total absence of any task related to the extraction of resources. The player only has to worry about the tactics to be adopted in battle, completing the set objectives to receive reinforcements and increase the level of the available units. A set of elements capable of combining immediacy and depth have therefore decreed its success, placing imperfections related to an artificial intelligence that is not perfect and a multiplayer that is not very innovative and poor in options on a lower level.", "date": "2006-11-07", "grade": null}
