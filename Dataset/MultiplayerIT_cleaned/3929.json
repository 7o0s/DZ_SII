{"name": "SBK Team Manager", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sbk-team-manager-recensione.html", "text": "SBK Team Manager tries to offer a managerial experience based on the Superbike championship, designed specifically for mobile devices: an interesting idea, if we consider how well the touch screen lends itself to this type of application. Once you have started the game, you immediately get the sensation of being faced with a product designed to be simple and immediate, and in fact those flashes of depth that can be glimpsed during the championship actually seem to conceal generally random solutions, which do not change the cards in table whatever the approach. Our goal is to take over a team, hire a driver and staff members, then go through an entire career trying to progressively improve the team's performance on the track. This also means investing where necessary, always paying attention not to go over the budget, guaranteed by a generous initial investment and by the ever-present sponsors, who will punctually reward us when we manage to obtain results in line with their expectations. The interface is quite clear and legible, but the solutions adopted betray an almost amateur vein, focusing solely on practicality. After having carried out the operations relating to the development of the bike, which requires several rounds for the possible arrival of new components, it is therefore possible to face the race weekends in their entirety or to simulate the race and be satisfied with the result obtained in this way. The problem, as we will soon discover, is that in the end, engaging and following the various steps directly does not necessarily produce a better outcome, and this is where the proverbial donkey falls. Gameplay and technique The developers of SBK Team Manager have developed a series of simple minigames to somehow represent the free practice sessions and qualifications: in the first case, you have to drag some of your skills into three slots and wait a few seconds for the simulation to complete , while in the second case you have to press the down-to-track button when the driver's concentration is high but there is little traffic on the circuit. Once we have obtained a position on the grid, as already mentioned, we will be able to choose whether to settle for an immediate simulation of the event or to follow all the stages by managing the race through a series of commands, thus trying to snatch a few points but substantially increasing the risk of fall and thus frustrate all the work done previously. The simulation of the race is visually very modest, and this unfortunately does not favorably affect the involvement, but the way in which it is possible to interact with your driver is interesting, through a series of commands (attack, follow, defend, neutral, etc.) which instantly modify its behavior (although requiring confirmation from time to time, which unnecessarily weighs down the action) and special abilities which allow you to overtake minimizing the risks, conserve the tire compound and so on. Fast-scrolling the race is the only way to avoid dragging it out too long, with a multiplier that goes up to X8 but making it tricky to make on-the-fly corrections if something goes wrong. We are therefore exposed to risks, as mentioned, which are too rarely rewarded, making the practice of following the race ~live~ less interesting than one might have expected. In short, a disappointment for those who thought they would find a complex managerial experience in this title, but occasional users could appreciate its style and spend some time in it in a pleasant way.", "date": "2018-11-28", "grade": "6.8"}
