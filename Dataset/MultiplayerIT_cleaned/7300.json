{"name": "System Shock", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/system-shock-recensione.html", "text": "System Shock (1994) was the fruit of a great intuition. 3D was now cleared through customs thanks to the success of DOOM and the general improvement of gaming PCs, and many studios were looking for a redefinition of the coordinates of the most popular experiences, to be able to exploit new technologies, so as to meet the increased expectations of gamers. When Looking Glass Studios made System Shock for Origin Systems, the only models it could refer to were the two Ultima Underworlds, from which many members of the development team happened to come (especially Dough Church and Warren Spector), so much so that, despite the scenario differences, one can speak without delay of a certain conceptual continuity between the projects. The mix between exploration and first-person shooter, with the player being left free to wander around the Citadel space station without necessarily having to follow a pre-set path, proved to be a winner for critics, less so for the public, which did not pay tribute to System Shock a particular success (read: it sold little, but was pirated a lot), with the status of a cult game that arrived essentially posthumously. Some of the elements that will characterize the immersive sims from Deus Ex and System Shock 2 onwards weren't there yet, but the road was now traced to define a certain mix between role-playing game and first person shooter. In short, we are talking about a title of great importance for the history of video games and the review of the remake of System Shock cannot fail to take this into account, to try to get a picture of the whole operation. Was there a need for the remake of System Shock? The first question that must be asked in the face of any remake is whether there was really a need for it. Contemporary audiences approach classic games terribly, looking for modern standards in them and judging them in relation to them. Thus it has become quite common practice to ask that the experiences that are remembered with particular affection be rejuvenated, so as not to have to make the effort to understand them in the historical moment in which they were produced. You want to please memories, but without giving up comfort. The problem in these cases is that some relationships have inevitably changed. As mentioned, when System Shock came out it represented the evolution of a formula with uncertain boundaries, while the remake arrives on the market when System Shock 2, Bioshock, Prey, Dishonored and many other immersive sims have been around for years now, so it is inevitable relate it to them. The remake of System Shock tries to present itself as an experience that is somewhat superimposable on the original The first consideration we can make, therefore, is that where the 1994 System Shock was configured as an evolutionary experience, the 2023 System Shock presents itself with a completely different attitude, imbued with great nostalgia and frightened by the prospect of proposing to potential players a vision that does not largely overlap with the original one. In fact, it almost seems like a religious operation. So here we are again in the role of the nameless hacker who woke up after six months of induced coma in the Citadel, where the artificial intelligence SHODAN, the real protagonist of the series as well as the most interesting character, went completely out of control and started develop a plan for the extermination of mankind, experimenting it on the station's occupants. Our goal is to stop it, going through all the floors of the base. Easier said that done. From 1994 to today The greater graphic realism clashes a bit with the abstract structure of the levels As soon as we take control of the protagonist we realize that the user experience is much more accurate than in the past, with fewer clicks to perform certain actions, a more agile and completely reworked interface, despite allowing you to do exactly the same things as the original ( it must be said that System Shock: Enhanced Edition had already worked well from this point of view) and a much less complex entry phase into the game. Naturally, the completely renewed graphics immediately catch the eye, the result of the efforts of years (literally) by Nightdive Studios, which worked really well on the atmospheres, taking great care of the lighting system and its effects on the gameplay. The result is that we are faced with a much more oppressive space station than the one in 1994, despite having maintained the same labyrinthine nature and largely the same abstraction in terms of architectural composition, despite the work done also from this point of view seen to increase its structural organicity is notable, however partial. SHODAN went down hard Even belowthe gameplay profile we are immediately at home, so to speak, with the game essentially requiring us to examine the environments shelf by shelf, corner by corner in search of useful objects, weapons, upgrades and registrations, with these last which represent the privileged access to the history of the game. Fortunately, it was decided not to add cutscenes or other static narrative systems, which would have risked breaking the rhythm of the gameplay. System Shock worked and, we can say, it works precisely because it makes us feel completely alone in a hostile environment, leaving the player himself with the burden of telling the fight against SHODAN and his army of robots and mutant creatures. game systems Combat feedback is the weakest part of the experience In System Shock the player spends most of his time doing two things: looking for objects, in particular access cards to closed areas and ammunition, managing them in the inventory, vaporizing those he considers less useful, keeping some weapons and throwing all the superfluous in the recycling stations so as to obtain precious credits, and fight. If we want, it is precisely the combat system that reminds us more than anything else that we are facing the remake of a 1994 game and shows some of the flaws in the operation. In honor of the original, no alternative system for dealing with enemies has been included. So when you get into their range, you will inevitably be attacked and all you have to do is hit them with your available weapons until they fall to the ground. So don't expect multiple approaches to Dishonored or Prey, because Nightdive Studios has chosen to respect the source title even in its now more problematic aspects. He did it to the point of having created a hit feedback system that recalls that of the 1994 game, creating a rather alienating effect. In the original System Shock, the static animations of the response to hits were normal and in a certain sense justified, with enemies who did not linger for a moment even when they were strafed, because they were 2D sprites moving in a 3D world. Also, as mentioned, there weren't many reference models and, inevitably, the developers ended up looking to DOOM. Let's be clear: for the time it was a very advanced system. However, that in the remake of System Shock the successful hits produce almost no feedback, as if they were not absorbed by the enemies, inevitably catches the eye. So whether you shoot a pistol or a ray weapon, the effects will always be the same. The melee weapons themselves do not produce satisfying feedback, although the animations of the shots predispose to expect much more. Thus, for example, hitting with the wrench, the blow is loaded with a very physical animation, also showing a certain effort on the part of the protagonist, but then slipping on the body of the enemy on duty at the time of execution, even in the case where you go to sign. Probably by inserting more marked feedback, the entire system should have been remodulated, which is largely modeled on that of the original. If we want, this is often one of the problems of the remakes, which see the developers too afraid of displeasing the fans, to the point of making counterproductive choices in order to avoid controversy. The problem, in this case, is that those who will know System Shock starting from the remake, will inevitably relate it to modern titles, ending up perceiving as a defect what is a decision probably dictated only by an exasperated form of respect. The same goes for the behavior of enemies which is very similar to that of the original title, to the point where you can use the same tactics to beat them. For example, you can position yourself in such a way as to have a clear perspective on the target, but making sure that its line of fire ends on an obstacle. Simple, effective, decidedly old school. Maybe too much. Scattered considerations The sections in cyberspace have been reviewed very well For the rest, the remake of System Shock offers exactly the same situations as the original. So expect random puzzles with electrical connections to be recreated on boards divided into square tiles and expect travel to cyberspace to unlock access to some areas and obtain data. The latter have been greatly revised from a technical point of view and experience, with a particular eye in trying to make them more dynamic and pleasant to live. Not that the cyberspace of the original was bad, just today the wireframe graphics and a certain blocky aesthetic of the enemies aren'twould have made a lot more sense, so wisely Nightdive decided to go for a more modern and colorful style, revising the entire section. The gameplay remains that of a first-person shooter with 360 movements a la Descent, but much faster and with more aggressive enemies, in which the goal is always to get to the end of the level alive, destroying all enemies and avoiding some obstacles, such as insidious mines. In general, it is difficult to define the new System Shock as a bad experience, also because it is built on a very solid foundation and of indisputable value. The only real regret is that the developers didn't show more courage in modifying some systems, modernizing the game even more, instead of constantly trying to celebrate the original. The result is a pleasant experience, certainly exciting, but which doesn't really add anything to the discourse of immersive sims, which the very first System Shock had begun to write.", "date": "2023-05-29", "grade": "8.0"}
