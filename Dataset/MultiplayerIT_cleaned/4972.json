They are the ones in which the principles inculcated in childhood collide with the profound changes that the body goes through when it becomes an adult, creating a friction that will only be resolved with death (you are allowed to touch each other). The school is not only an institution, but it is also the place where one matures physically and mentally (well, mentally only some, but it counts as a general principle): it is where one begins to become aware of the opposite sex and to experience the first love stories, sometimes beautiful and delicate, other times dramatic and meaningful. In short, it is a fundamental stage for growth, especially in the teenage years, those in which there are more doubts and uncertainties, in which the impulses become irrepressible and every pimple becomes the subject of a Shakespearean tragedy. In short, in adolescence we suddenly discover fragile and unstable and school desks are the ideal stage to stage these feelings, which will indelibly determine our future. For this reason, the school is so present in the collective imagination and is used as a setting for works of all kinds, from committed novels to porn with sexy female students. Miniature Garden falls into the genre of psychological horror with strong intimist traits. It is a Japanese visual novel that tells of a school, called Miniature Garden, which stands in a forest. If you think about it, school buildings, especially the older ones, always have a disturbing and mysterious side due to the overlapping of lives and voices of the present and the past inside them. Here some students, including the protagonist Yasunari, busy preparing for the so-called Miniature Festival, remain stuck in the building for an entire night. Is this a coincidence or is the legend true and will someone die a violent death before daybreak? What are the seven mysteries? What are the threads that bind the stories of the five prisoners? Why do some of them seem oppressed by a past they can't get rid of? To answer these and many other questions, all that remains is to follow the story. Of our own we avoid telling you more so as not to anticipate anything of the decisive events of which it is composed. We reviewed the visual novel Miniature Garden. Find out what we think. Having to describe the story from a general point of view, we would define it as a good horror, which however makes extensive use of clichs, starting from the premise (how many students who get stuck at night school are Japanese horrors full of?). In truth, as a videogame genre requires, there are more endings (seven) and to get the complete picture of the situation you need to unlock them all. Some of these are really well written and, despite the lack of originality, they are exciting. Let's say that the writers of the Muzintou studio have managed to stage very strong feelings, seasoned with assorted mysteries, without ever falling into the cloying, despite some slip-ups on the pathetic. On the other hand, the drawings by Riko Korie, an artist known in the field of visual novels, who worked well on the characters, are always very beautiful, although here too the clichs abound and the style is not particularly original. However, the childish features of the protagonists contrast appropriately with the central themes of the story, making some changes of atmosphere more disturbing. The backgrounds are less inspired, all too generic and, in some cases, coarse. Whoever made them evidently sought a painterly style, but the overall effect is that of a poorly applied Photoshop filter. From the point of view of the game system, Miniature Garden is a very classic visual novel. It certainly has more than good production values, given the dubbing (Japanese) and the animated introduction in full anime style, but in terms of interface and options it just does its thing. So we can choose the scrolling speed of the texts, or consult the list of endings reached, or look at a gallery of animations unlocked by playing. In the game you just read and make decisions from time to time, with the classic multiple choice system. Let's say that to complete everything, skipping the texts already read previously, it takes about ten hours. A standard time, in short. Other interesting visual novels The offer of visual novels is now very rich also in the West. There are literally dozens of them on Steam. If you are interested, you cannot avoid some classics of the genre such as Clannad or the Grisaia series, while among the most recent we recommend Da Capo 3 R by Circus, Sweetest Monster by ebi-hime, Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters Daybreak: Special Gigs by Arc System Works and Toybox, ChronoClock by Purple Software or World End Economica whose third episode has just been released. One last note: be careful, because given the diffusion of Steam also in the East, for a while now there have also been titles in the original language. Always check that there are at least English subtitles before buying. Obviously if you know Japanese or Chinese it's better for you.", "date": "2017-03-29", "grade": "7.5"}
