{"name": "RollerCoaster Tycoon 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rollercoaster-tycoon-3.html", "text": "Not just roller coasters The tutorial is well structured but not very thorough: given and considered the complexity of the game, something more could have been done to compensate for the initial sense of bewilderment that a novice user could feel with this kind of simulations. The career mode has been improved, offering a wide and varied choice of scenarios, with different objectives depending on the progressively unlocked difficulty level. By popular demand, an unlimited game mode has also been integrated, in which you can indulge yourself without specific objectives and time, resource or money limits. The more willing and creative will also be able to try their hand at designing personalized scenarios to play or pass on to friends. The options available for creating and managing parks are so many that you get lost in the menus: for a summary of the most important and original, we refer you to the preview article that appeared some time ago on our pages. Here, we'll just sum up what we found in the final version of the game and mention a few gems that will delight aficionados of the series. There are so many options available for creating and managing parks that you get lost in the menus. Not just roller coasters Among the many innovations, for the construction of roller coasters, a precious function of automatic completion of the tracks has been introduced and the possibility of testing them before opening, to verify their correct functioning and the potential adrenaline level; it is even possible to install photo positions along the route, which will immortalize the passengers in the heart of the action. All rail attractions can be further enriched with events programmed to trigger the passage of the carriages in a precise point, reviving from time to time the emotion of a shark attack, the sudden appearance of a tyrannosaurus, a landslide of boulders , the eruption of a volcano or burning oil wells. The terrain modification tools are intuitive and fun to use: the supernatural power of moving mountains, creating canyons or flattening a valley with a few clicks of the mouse is quite expensive, but it allows us to make the most of the space available to us and bend the surrounding landscape to our technical and scenographic needs! Finally, thanks to the MixMaster for creating fireworks, we will be able to leave our park guests speechless in front of spectacular fireworks displays, programmed for various hours of the day and night and possibly synchronized to our favorite song. The graphic effects that give life to the explosions and the lights of the fires are surprisingly realistic: it is a joy for the eyes to see them crackling in a thousand colors in the sky of our park. The people editor allows you to model visitors for your own use and consumption, defining their name, appearance and preferences. Another novelty is the presence of VIPs, who can increase the prestige of the park and advertise us: satisfying them in all respects will be our mission, if we want to win prizes and fame. The group dynamics that affect the behavior of the guests, divided into groups of friends or family, are interesting: adults, adolescents and children show different interests in the attractions (for example, you mostly see kids queuing up for roller coasters and parents waiting for the little ones around the children's rides). Observing people's reactions is precisely one of the greatest sources of entertainment in RCT3 and at the same time an obsession, given that our luck depends on them: we will see our little virtual customers running at breakneck speed to queue up for the last open carousel , scream and throw your arms up on the roller coaster or snub the bumper cars, because they are too expensive and outdated... Entertainment moguls cry too Here comes what is perhaps the greatest source of frustration in the game: understanding why sometimes, for no apparent reason, an attraction has no appeal at all. A generic approval rating is provided for each ride, and we can even read individual visitors' thoughts about it, but that isn't always enough to explain why at any given time, park paths are paved with vomit and trash, food stalls are stormed and all the rides work at full capacity, inexorably starting to break down one after the other and triggering an insidious domino effect that threatens to make us get out of hand, and a moment later it's the desert, no one takes over queue, nobody buys anything! In thesesituations, when the triggering reason is not clear, all that remains is to go by trial and error: prices are lowered, attractions are renewed, services are improved... the fact is that the dynamics which determine or not the success of a park or specific attractions are not always crystal clear. Compounding the problem is also the fact that many activities aimed at personalizing and enriching the park are rather onerous in terms of time, even if they do not give any additional guarantee of success: we can spend hours designing what seems to us to be the best roller coaster world or frantically shaping the landscape, without however being sure of reaping the desired benefits later on, which is not very motivating. Entertainment moguls cry too The learning curve is relatively long, if you want to master all the tools available to the player and discover the best strategies to always stay afloat in the ruthless world of entertainment - this, of course, is not necessarily to be considered a defect. The secrets of building the ideal roller coaster, for example, still remain secrets for us, even after countless attempts: it is not easy to understand what precautions or technical knowledge it is necessary to follow to leave all the passengers breathless... possibly avoiding unpleasant accidents. Some knowledge on the impact of inertial and gravitational forces for correct design is provided during the relative tutorial, but the laymen will still encounter various perplexities during the laying of the tracks. A light and sound show, with an extra dimension The new three-dimensional look of this third episode of the series, which is undoubtedly the most striking novelty, contributes decisively to facilitating the construction of roller coasters: finally we have the possibility to observe and modify our attractions from every angle and it is even importing roller coasters made for previous versions of the game. The graphics in general are pleasant and lively, above all the number and variety of guests who continually pour into the park (when business is good, of course). The CoasterCam is spectacular: it allows you not only to experience the thrill of a roller coaster ride firsthand but also to experience almost all the other rides. At night the parks are dotted with sparkling lights: torches and street lamps, which vary according to our taste or the chosen setting, flashing signs and headlights that illuminate the attractions. The effects of light and shadow are impressive and their dynamics faithfully reflect the passing of the hours of the day. In fact, some parks remain open 24 hours a day, others only day or night, which also affects the demographic composition of the public. In the game options, however, it is possible to disable or adapt most of the graphic effects to your computer, although with a modest configuration you will not be able to enjoy the reflections on the water surfaces or the higher resolutions; in the case of highly developed and crowded parks, the frame rate could hiccup and the animations be a little less fluid, but without dramatic repercussions on the gameplay, since the developers have prided themselves on having kept the hardware requirements at discrete levels. We finally have the ability to observe and edit our attractions from every angle. A light and sound show, with an extra dimension The interface has gained in style: it is rather essential but undoubtedly functional. Aspiring managers will always have all the information they need to screen and manage the park's resources and personnel at their fingertips. Moving the camera is quite intuitive, as soon as you become familiar with the basic commands, and the graphics engine manages to easily rotate the three-dimensional images and to render even the details fluidly and naturally, thanks to the powerful zoom function. The sound effects are respectable: there is everything you need, the buzz of the crowd, the shouts and laughter. The background songs of the menus and those that accompany the individual attractions are catchy but not very numerous. However, there is the possibility to import your own MP3 files into the game and synchronize them with the fireworks shows and all the attractions. Above all, it is pleasant to perceive the implementation of directional sounds and the increase or decrease in the music of the various attractions, as one approaches or moves away from them. Comment Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is a very rich game: there is so much to do and just as much to discover. Attention egBut don't be misled by the theme and the cheerful colorful packaging: RCT3 is not a game for children. Given its complexity, the articulation of the menus and the economic and design principles that underlie its mechanics, the younger ones would risk finding it frustrating and too bizarre. All the others, fans of the genre and not, will instead discover an irresistible and addictive game that boasts an impressive longevity, thanks to the unlimited mode and complex editing tools. Despite some small unknowns in the construction system of the roller coasters and in the mechanisms that regulate the attractiveness of the parks, it is certainly a unique product of its kind and worthy of note. Pros: Successful 3D restyling Guaranteed longevity Editor for all tastes Cons: Tutorial a bit rushed for such a complex game Difficult to understand what doesn't work in a park and why Building a serious roller coaster is no joke In its third incarnation, in the capable hands of Frontier, RCT has not changed its flavor or character but has undeniably grown: fans of the genre will recognize you as one of the most articulated and complete management software currently on the market. Fun is ensured by the irresistible theme and longevity by four different game modes and just as many tools to customize and perfect the park of your dreams. On closer inspection, there are some small flaws, perhaps just some ~growth problems~, but nothing that risks jeopardizing the hours of leisure that this captivating title promises...", "date": "2005-01-10", "grade": null}
