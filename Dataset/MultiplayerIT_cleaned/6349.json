Felipe Falanghe, an employee of Team Squad who until four years ago was involved in marketing management for the development of interactive technologies and multimedia creations in Mexico City, certainly had this dream since he was a child. However, Felipe was too stressed by his job and was about to resign when he was asked, before leaving, what he would like to do in life and he replied that he would like to create a video game: he didn't believe his ears when his bosses told him to show their idea and Felipe, now lead designer of Kerball Space Program, came up with a project he had had since he was a boy when, in Brazil, his native country, together with his friends he created small tin toy men, which he called Kerbal, trying to launch them into space aboard rudimentary fireworks. Team Squad supported Felipe's project and, seven months later, Kerbal Space Program was made available in alpha on Steam: right away we sensed that we were dealing with a brilliant game, with enormous potential and after four years of development and a community Ever growing in support, it is with great emotion and excitement that we are about to share this unique product with you. Kerball Space Program is finally available in its full version! What is Kerbal Space Program? It is undoubtedly the most accurate and entertaining space simulation ever created; you can build rockets, launch them into space and explore the immense planetary system around the Sun: this includes landing on unexplored planets and collecting scientific data while remaining in orbit around them or on their surfaces. The center of your action, where the main buildings are located from which you will plan both the construction of the rockets and the flights, is the planet Kerbin, Earth's counterpart with similar physical conformations, even if the continents are arranged differently. This planet is inhabited by the Kerbals, a funny race of humanoids among which the Kerbonauts stand out, heroes who will contribute, depending on whether they are pilots, engineers, scientists or space tourists, to your aim which will be to help them achieve their goals of research and development and to guide them on their interplanetary journeys. There are three game modes: the sandbox which will allow you to build any rocket or aircraft without any kind of limitation or negative consequence for failure; the much more structured science mode, which will allow you to access the various rocket technologies through experimentation; the career mode that will put you the stakes related to the economic field. In fact, here to progress in space exploration, you will be bound to complete contracts to raise funds and to gain reputation as well as science points that are as useful as in the second mode mentioned. At a first observation, these little humanoids, resembling the minions of ~Despicable Me~, could suggest a simple and demented game but Kerbal Space Program is not at all and the physics that regulates it is the most realistic that can be found in such a video game that even Newton would applaud the application of his rules, for example, when our vehicle will be captured by the gravity of a moon or a planet being at the right distance or when it is necessary to aero-brake (exploit the friction of the air in the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft). Before going on to describe the three modes in detail, we advise everyone to familiarize themselves with the basics of the game through the tutorials present: the simplest ones will allow you to learn how to build rockets, use the flight controls, understand how the Navball works and put orbit your rocket; while the more complex ones will try to teach you how to perform more complicated maneuvers such as ~docking~ (the docking of two ships that are orbiting at different speeds, just like the Soyouz shuttle when it brings supplies or new crew to the International Space Base ). Space for creativity In the Sandbox you will let your imagination run wild without worrying about any consequences, all buildings are at maximum level (i.e. fully built) and money and science points are not present, thus having full access to all parts to build our rocket, to which just enter the Vehicle Assembly Building where you will have a list of useful components divisi by category: crew capsules, fuel tanks, engines, on-board computers, structural parts to hold everything together, aerodynamic components such as ailerons or heat shields, scientific instruments and various utilities such as ladders to get off the rocket or parachutes. Assembling the pieces is very simple and the modular editor will allow you to join virtually any piece to another; you can start, even using intuition alone, with something vaguely shaped like a rocket. You will be able to rotate, multiply and symmetrically assemble any piece, attaching it to another already present, using the ~drag and drop~ interface with the pieces changing their brightness when attached correctly. As soon as you feel ready, click on the launch button and your creation will be moved to the external platform. At this point you will stop being engineers and become pilots ready to launch: pay attention to the interface of the sequence of actions, as it will depend on the order of ignition of the engines, the detachment of the parts and the opening of the parachute. Did you accidentally open the parachute along with the second stage of the rocket and now everything is spinning? No problem, you can go back to the moment of launch, rearrange the order of actions and start again. Did you forget to put on your parachute (um, let's avoid drinking before the launch)? Go back to the moment before transport to the launchpad, add it and try again. Whether it is a success or a failure, depending on how the flight went, you will understand which modifications to apply and which improvements to make: if you have not managed to reach the 70,000 meters useful for making a suborbital flight, perhaps you need a more powerful engine ; If on your first attempt to turn, the rocket went upside down, you'll need to readjust the ailerons or add thrusters to maneuver more precisely. From here on, despite the limitless structure typical of the sandbox, you will have an entire planetary system to explore starting from Mun, Kerbin's first moon, up to the most distant and difficult to reach planets; you won't have to do it, but it will give you a sense of progression even within this mode. Finally, it must be said that the world in which Kerbal Space Program takes place is persistent, in the sense that for example you can easily build a space base along the lines of the ISS around the planet Duna (Mars counterpart) and leave it there as a station likewise, if you have left an astronaut on Mun because you ran out of fuel to restart, he will remain there until someone comes to rescue him (Kerbals do not die a natural death). A little more attention Also in Science mode you will have access to each building at the maximum level and the money will not be present, however, the parts at your disposal to build the spaceship will be limited and to obtain them you will have to progress in the science tree which can be consulted in the Research and Developent Building: here you can also consult all the information collected during the experiments on your travels. Obtaining science points is very rewarding and will give you the sensation of discovering, little by little, every phenomenon present in the immense Kerbal Space Program system. For example, we pass from the simple observation, by the kerbonauts, of the landscape that surrounds them, both by remaining inside the capsule and by making them go out for an EVA (extra vehicular activity) during the flight or after landing on the surface of moons or planets . You can also equip your vehicle with scientific instruments, such as thermometers, barometers, scanners, to know what materials are present on the ground. Each of these data collections will give you science points and they will be useful to unlock more and more technologies. To ~bring home~ this collected data, you can transmit them to Kerbin through the radio antenna that you will mount on the spacecraft (this will make you lose part of the collected data) or you will write them down but, in this case, you will have to return the instrumentation safe and sound to Earth. If this is not possible, you can manually collect data from these instruments with a Kerbonauta EVA, transport it to the crew capsule, and then undock the instruments before atmospheric reentry. Space is serious business The Career mode, whose difficulty can be changed from easy to difficult by altering variables such as the money available at the start of the game or the possibility or not of returning at launch in case of failure, you will have to deal with a real and own simulation of a space organization such as NASA or ESA. AllThe buildings will be level one and you can upgrade them with money as you progress and succeed in the missions. Buildings such as Mission Control will become important, in which you will be able to accept work contracts ranging from the simple launch of the first rocket to the more advanced exploration or landing on planets, from rescuing a kerbonaut in space to space tourist transport for which you will have to build a special spaceship that also has room for a passenger, who will appear very frightened during the launch and very happy once in orbit. The success of these contracts will bring you money, some science points and reputation points. Another important building will be the Administration Building in which you will be able to recruit one of the four Kerbals available and experts, respectively, in finance, public relations, science and repairs: by choosing one, you will get a modifier bonus to increase money, reputation or science depending on the specialty of Kerbal recruited. We can hire new pilots, engineers or scientists even if we will initially have four available. Pilots can move the rocket, engineers can fix parts that break during the journey, and scientists can increase the science points obtained with experimentation. Increasing the level of the various buildings involves the possibility of doing more things: for example, if we don't bring the launch pad to level two, we won't be able to exceed the total weight of 18 tons for the rocket or if we don't increase the astronaut center, they won't learn how to do EVAs in space and so on. The feeling of progression is maximum but if you play it perfectly, without using any quick saves to retry a maneuver or a landing, the Career mode will be really very difficult. For those who already own this title which, we recall, has been in development and can be purchased for four years already, the release version, which has been out for a few days, will not be difficult to understand. However, it introduces some very interesting innovations: first of all, the atmospheric re-entry and all that derives from it, as we will have to equip the spaceship with the new heat shields available and maneuver the capsule so that it does not try to re-enter on the parachute side, unless you fancy roast Kerbal! The aerodynamics have been slightly changed and you'll need to make a more precise and realistic curve towards the horizon to get into orbit decently. Visual effects have also been added when launching and when passing through certain parts of the atmosphere where air is more frictional. There are new mission types, new parts for building the rocket, a new 'Engineering Report' panel that will point you to obvious mistakes in building the rocket. The tutorial was fleshed out to teach the basics even more accurately, and finally, the female Kerbals were introduced. This is an excellent update that makes the product even more brilliant. The graphics sector is quite simple and minimalist and, at first glance, it seems quite sparse. However, being in orbit around a planet and seeing the light effect of the rising sun, when the rocket goes from dark to light, gives a very realistic feeling and really closely resembles all the various videos and photos that he sends us our Samantha Cristoforetti from the ISS. It's still not free from small graphical bugs when, for example, we try to make transfer maneuvers by simulating the orbits but it's very little and everything is really very pleasant, without needing a particularly high-performance PC to run properly. The music is really spot on ranging from jazz / fusion motifs during the construction of the rocket to the ambient genre that suggests the various space flight situations. Kerbal Space Program is undoubtedly a difficult game and, perhaps, it is not suitable for those who do not have at least a minimum of patience: the difficulty in achieving a given objective has nothing to do with the game itself but with physics with the which you'll come to terms with, so it closely resembles what humans did in the late 1950s, when they put a man in a capsule on top of several tons of fuel and shot him off the planet. However, this difficulty can be reduced by using the mods that go around the net and that the game has supported since birth with a special item on the main menu. The most famous of these additions, Mechjeb, you can for example have an automatic pilot that performs the maneuvers for you: perhaps it simplifies things a bit too much but it gives you an idea of the maximum result you can obtain with the spaceship and, in fact , the maneuvers will be performed with the maximum", "date": "2015-05-10", "grade": "9.0"}
