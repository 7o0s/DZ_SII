{"name": "Amped", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/amped_a.html", "text": "Extreme sports have always exerted a particular charm and boast numerous videogame transpositions, even in the mobile sector. On mobile, we've already had the opportunity to perform acrobatic maneuvers aboard motorcycles, and now Amped allows us to launch ourselves onto snowy slopes armed only with a simple snowboard, taking advantage of each trampoline to twist and score points. In short, a video game about extreme sports in its most classic sense, however, with a surprising depth: the internships must be unlocked by conquering victories, and to win it is necessary to reach a certain score on each track. But there's no shortage of extras: in some points of the tracks we will find bonus missions, which once completed enrich our repertoire of tricks, the possibility of changing the appearance of the character and more... Amped features a ~quick game~ mode and the classic ~career~. You have to select the latter and proceed through the stages so that you can use them in the ~quick game~, therefore the first impact with the game is not the simplest: there is no tutorial, given the simplicity of the structure, but to understand what to do and how to do it will take several games. The control of the character is of the classic type: the joystick to change direction while touching the snow, the 5 key to jump (you can and must keep it loaded for the jump to be more powerful) and then the joystick again to perform the maneuvers acrobatics in the air, also in combination with the 5 key. On the right side of the screen there is a bar that visually indicates progress towards the required score: you have to reach it by the end of the track, or resign yourself to repeating it until you succeed to do it. And this is where one of the strengths of this title lies: it is very simple to understand, but quite challenging. Don't think that the first events are affordable, because that's not the case: right from the start we will have to give our all and take advantage of every trampoline and every free moment to perform tricks and accumulate points. As mentioned, extra missions are also arranged on the track, which represent a challenge within a challenge, because completing them automatically means giving up the race itself to unlock some bonuses. There will be various obstacles to make life difficult: first of all the natural ones, in this case trees and barriers; secondly, our ability to understand when to finish a trick and straighten the board for landing. Each manoeuvre, to produce points, must be completed correctly: performing an infinite rotation and then crashing on the snow will be useless. The graphics of the game offer a mix of polygonal and bitmap elements, rendered very well: usually we rely on polygonal graphics alone to obtain a certain fluidity in the animation, perhaps renouncing the detail, while in this case we have the two-dimensional character but very well animated. Everything flows smoothly, against the background of photo-realistic landscapes, with excellent use of colours. The sound sector, unfortunately, does not boast the same quality: in addition to fairly well-made MIDI music, we have really mediocre effects. PRO Smooth and well designed graphics Numerous slopes and numerous tricks Immediate and fun... AGAINST ...but quite challenging Mediocre sound Response to commands not always immediate", "date": "2008-03-21", "grade": "S.V."}
