{"name": "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/140292-the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-tra-peti-e-budella.html", "text": "The problems with The Binding of Isaac are known to anyone who has played it. Choosing an Adobe Flash-based engine to build it had limited fluidity and required many compromises. When it came to bringing the game to the console, it was immediately clear that it was impossible to do so, either due to compatibility problems or because it would never have been as fluid as desired (it's not a problem of hardware power, but of Flash). Quite a paradox for a title full of bodily fluids and ejections that drip from everywhere. So Edmund McMillen decided to leave the direct port alone and re-founded the project starting from scratch, keeping only some graphic elements and entrusting a large part of the development to Nicalis, an independent team of the highest level. To avoid misunderstandings, it is urgent to clarify that The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is not only the reprogrammed 2011 game: there are so many new contents that one could speak of a sequel, despite the basic mechanics of movement, procedural generation of levels and unlocking of upgrades have remained virtually unchanged. At a casual glance, even the technical side could appear very similar, but in reality there are differences and they can be seen. Meanwhile, the smooth graphic style has been abandoned in favor of pixel art, as desired by McMillen. In addition, numerous lighting effects have been added, which have also been exploited as an element of gameplay. For example, in some cases it will happen to find yourself practically in the dark, having to fight against enemies that are barely visible in the dim light. The animations have also all been revised and are now much more pleasant; pixel art has made him gain a lot in physicality, which is not bad for a title that bases most of its charm on the anarchic use of every possible internal organ of the human race and beyond. Will The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth be able to make us forget the original? Already a big hit? At the time of writing this review, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is firmly at the top of the Steam rankings. Not only that, it is also the fourth most played game among those purchasable in the Valve virtual shop, surpassed only by the inevitable Counter Strike: Global Offensive, DOTA 2 and Team Fortress 2. In short, the success is already great, a tangible sign of the love of gamers for the original. Unfortunately we have no PSN version data. However, given that it is being given away to all PlayStation Plus subscribers this month, it is easy to assume that it will be downloaded by thousands of people. Mum is always mum In Rebirth, Isaac remains the lonely and frightened child who fights against the traumas of a childhood made up of marginalization and, above all, of an apprehensive and very religious mother. We can consider McMillen's work as a small treatise on psychology, in which the explosion of bodies in puddles of guts and blood is the picturesque setting of a sorrowful symphony, which captivates because it tells a bit of what many of us have been and in part we still are. It's hard not to get attached to this tearful little boy who fights at the price of heavy physical deformations, exploiting but suffering the effects of the bonuses he collects. Sure, with success Isaac grew up and started fighting more varied opponents, some even nice (see Monstro). Religious symbols, previously only in the background of the relationship with the mother, have become the real enemies to be defeated: archetypal, powerful, fascinating in their being represented as childish figurines deformed by the passage of time. The Binding of Isaac, including the expansion, has never been just an action game with rooms to clear, bosses to eliminate, secrets to find and items to collect. Instead it was and is the plastic representation of the Oedipal conflict. People like it not only because it's fun, but because it tells what we are as human beings and it does so in a very profound way both in its narrative fabric, however apparently weak, and in the action. That is why it is quite silly to criticize him for bad taste. Isaac's clean and minimalist design is the canvas on which his rebellion against his mother's rules is drawn, those rules that have distanced him from his nature also made up of excrement, farts and various excrements. Hot organs As in the past, Isaac faces the first maze, randomly generated, with only his tears. By finding objects he will obtain countless bonuses, related to health, strength, speed, range and so on. Discoveries will also unlock new items and enemies for subsequent games. Once dead, he will lose what he has collected and will have to start a new labyrinth, where he will find new objects and new enemies. Thesystem works perfectly and it is unlikely that in a game there are no discoveries to make (unless you die immediately or have already played for hundreds of hours). This was also true for the original The Binding of Isaac, but here are many more items, more enemies, more bosses and more types of rooms, some of which span multiple screens (in the original, each room only took up one screen). Many decorative elements have also been added to the scenarios which make it visually more varied than the past version. In short, everything has been revised to give a reason to buy the game even for those who had spent hundreds of hours with the first one, perhaps trying it in a cooperative or facing the challenges that are unlocked by advancing in the adventure. The only downside to Rebirth is the soundtrack. In reality, the new songs aren't bad (the sound effects, on the other hand, have remained practically unchanged), only that we are a little missing some of the old ones that were truly exceptional and strongly characterizing; seamlessly integrated into the gameplay and contributed to the atmosphere. Surely more annoying are some bugs that infest version 1.0. A resolving patch will soon be released, but in the meantime we have to point out some compatibility problems with some keyboards and problems deleting saves.", "date": "2014-11-07", "grade": "9.2"}
