In recent years, the publisher has been able to build a completely over the top image, becoming the bearer of titles that may not be particularly advanced on a technical level, but based on original gameplay and unique atmospheres. Hotline Miami, Downwell, The Messenger and Broforce are just a few games of incredible depth, capable of achieving a goal that triple A titles often completely lack: to have fun. On this same line of thought comes a new proposal in the catalog with the desire to subvert the usual clichs and feed us something completely different from the usual. Carrion's review therefore tells of a title that arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC and Nintendo Switch, bringing horror and tension to all existing platforms. We threw ourselves headlong into this review devouring the title in a single and very long game session, gobbling level after level without feeling the slightest weight of the passing by: a new title not to be missed? As the monster If you like the gloomy atmospheres of John Carpenter's The Thing, if you love the nefarious space corridors of Alien and adore horror films with monstrous creatures, Carrion could already rightfully be one of the must-haves for the summer season, especially given that there are very few such. Phobia Game Studios could have easily made you play the role of a desperate scientist committed to eradicating an unspecified alien monster but with a little mental effort the studio managed to propose something new, finally subverting the roles. In fact, this time it will be up to you to sow panic in an underground research station, initially escaping from the laboratories and gradually becoming larger and larger, while devouring everything that gets in your way. You will take control of a shapeless red creature, full of tentacles, teeth and who knows what other appendage ready to creep into the unfortunate victims. The control system is based on the simple use of the analog sticks for movement and aiming, exactly as if it were any twin stick shooter, but unfortunately there are problems, especially on Nintendo Switch. Often to progress between the different levels you will have to pull levers and push switches, even before massacring the unfortunate humans, and the precision is not exactly the most satisfactory. If during the environmental puzzles, in fact, you will have plenty of time to aim correctly, we found ourselves several times arguing with the tentacles during the most agitated moments, with the prehensile protuberances that just didn't want to grab the right object , often risking making us lose health in a frustrating way. Luckily Carrion is never hostile enough to make you curse the control scheme and, one way or another, you will almost always be able to get out of the clashes easily. There are many options for overcoming the different rooms of the base and if on the one hand nothing will prevent you from breaking down the doors with vehemence and mowing down everything inside, you can also try to play cunning by crawling through the ducts and eliminating the enemies in an (almost) silent way. Mind you though, it's obviously not a stealth game, since in any case the targeted people will scream in pain while you're intent on spreading blood and limbs around the room, but the basic concept allows for different approaches and solutions and this, ultimately in the end, it matters enormously more. You will start out as a small red blob and as you progress through the levels you will come into possession of experimental DNA cells which will not only visually increase your mass but will also grant you special abilities, useful, not even on purpose, to reach previously unreachable ravines or discover unexplored areas. We are not at the level design complexity thresholds of the most refined metroidvanias and consequently also the backtracking is rather reduced and appears only in the final stages of the game. The rest of your adventure will unfold in a rather linear way, with the various environmental puzzles needing only a pinch of gray matter but nothing particularly insurmountable. Carrion is generally pretty straightforward and while there's a vague hint of disorientation with all the pipes and passageways intertwining, one rarely feels truly lost. Let's rely on sonar What is really missing in a title of this type is a map of the different game areas in order to facilitate navigation and not get lost in the various power-ups, which are essential to advance. As you level up, you earnYou will get hit points but also additional game mechanics. In addition to the classic ability to move increasingly heavy panels you will get access to chitinous shields, invisibility to pass through lasers and not trigger any alarms or lockouts and above all a special tentacle to creep inside humans taking control of them using them as slaves . The variety of enemies is not amazing but those present are still sufficient to guarantee different approach interactions. There are soldiers with flamethrowers whose fire can be extinguished by diving, flying robots, soldiers equipped with machine guns and even mechas to be disassembled before being able to get to the pilot and suck him like a calipp from his position. In short, we have fun, as we said at the beginning and it will be easy to want to continue playing to find out what obstacle awaits us. Another interesting gimmick is having relegated the abilities to the specific evolutions of the creature, so when you pass from phase one to phase two, for example, you will lose the possibility of becoming invisible in favor of a stunning push, a choice that will force you to discharge the excess biomass if you need a specific skill at that moment and that slightly complicates a well-thought-out game system. The pixelated graphics outline an incredible atmosphere, amplified by ad hoc music and pleasant animations, adorned with well-crafted physics. The only drawback from this point of view is the variety of settings that fails to stand out and get noticed as we would have liked, yet from this point of view we could have been inspired by thousands of examples from cinema and comics to go a little beyond the underground laboratories, which will accompany you roughly for the entire duration of the adventure. A small neo, however, for a title that deserves to be played.", "date": "2020-07-23", "grade": "8.0"}
