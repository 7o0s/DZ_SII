{"name": "Grounded", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grounded-recensione-survival-obsidian.html", "text": "Beyond the issues of triple A games and Game Pass sustainability, Obsidian seems to want to expose a very clear idea of the advantages of the distribution model through its new productions, and we can already give an evaluation in this Grounded review. Development started before the Microsoft acquisition, but it can be said that the subscription service has allowed the team to keep this strange project alive and develop it even beyond the initial planning, reaching a much larger form than expected . In the same way, almost in the same period, Josh Sawyer was carrying out his passion project with Pentiment and we can think that both games have been supported thanks to the new organization of resources that derives from the Game Pass, therefore in some way the team he seems to have adapted perfectly to this way of producing games. And the results can be seen: the creative freedom left to the team has unlocked resources to create decidedly particular gaming experiences. Furthermore, it would be a mistake to confuse the limited dimensions of the production with the actual results achieved: Grounded is a project on a smaller scale in terms of resources used but it starts from a very ambitious idea, and the time taken to complete it - albeit in the face of a very small team engaged on the game - it makes it clear. In some ways, it could be the fulfillment of a childhood dream for many: those who saw the early days of the gaming industry probably imagined, at least once, what it would be like to make an insect-friendly game, with an imagination that years 80-90 found a concrete realization in the cinematographic hit ~Tesoro mi si ristretti i bambini~. Not for nothing, the whole game is focused on the nostalgic recollection of that period in a decidedly apt way, and for those who were there at the time and fantasized about miniaturized odysseys, Grounded can really be a fantastic gift from Obsidian. A strange story Grounded, an image with the house in the background One of the most anticipated additions of version 1.0 was the arrival of a full-fledged story mode, here introduced by a full motion video opening sequence introducing the mystery of the missing children, before launching directly into the action as one of such boys, all evidently miniaturized for unknown reasons. The narration is certainly not one of the main elements of the gaming experience, which remains essentially a pure and hard survival, even if the story certainly contributes to the construction of its characterization. However, the elements of the story have already been introduced in the previous versions of the Game Preview: there is a strange mad scientist, called Wendell Tully, who on behalf of the mysterious research company Ominent has invented a machine capable of miniaturizing human beings.Something has gone horribly wrong, probably due to a mysterious group keeping an eye on the research: the scientist disappears and four boys find themselves miniaturized in the garden of the Tullys' house, with no memories of what brought them there or any idea of what to do , but it seems that the key to returning to normal is to explore the micro-labs scattered around the area, collect the Pure Science scattered around (a sort of currency that is used to unlock new side quests and additional projects for crafting) and find responsible for all this chaos. Grounded, new landmarks open up additional sections of the map The affable robot Burg.l, assistant to the scientist, will offer to lend us a hand by proposing various quests in person or through the terminals scattered around the laboratories, while the main story is joined by sub-plots on espionage towards the Ominent and the situation family member of Tully to enrich the picture a little, even if everything remains rather in the background. The story has the advantage of keeping the tone perfectly centered on the 80s adventure film atmospheres but above all it has the function of providing objectives for exploring new areas of the garden, given that the focal points of this correspond to the opening of new roads to reach further explorable areas. Gameplay, survival and progression Grounded, survival is easier in multiplayer The structure has already been analyzed in the tests carried out during the early access period, therefore we also refer you to the first test carried out in Game Preview and to the following one, on the updated version a few months later. The gameplay has obviously not changed with version 1.0, but the contents have increased significantly, in terms ofexplorable areas, enemies, resources and game possibilities. Grounded is a survival game that can be tackled in single player or in cooperative multiplayer, all focused on the survival of the boys in a common and apparently harmless ecosystem like that of a home garden, but seen from the unprecedented perspective of characters a few centimeters tall, which transforms it in an environment full of pitfalls but also of possibilities. It is therefore a question of carrying out dangerous crossings between stalks of grass, puddles, lakes, micro-marshes, hedges and so on, keeping an eye on the vital parameters of the character and trying to survive the constant threats posed by various insects and small animals, search for the tools to be able to return to normal. The main story sets some objectives to follow, which usually coincide with the discovery of new areas to explore, as well as providing new narrative fragments that explain the mystery behind Tully and the Ominent, mainly through documents and recordings scattered throughout the laboratories. The latter are presented as sorts of simple dungeons, sometimes containing enemies and bosses to be killed, as well as unpublished materials that can lead to new crafting and character evolution possibilities. They are not particularly structured moments, but if nothing else they manage to offer diversions compared to the standard dynamic from full survival and introducing a certain progression into the game. Grounded lets you explore a pond In this aspect, there are some elements added in version 1.0 that apply some RPG characteristics: the ~milk teeth~ that are hidden in the map allow you to invest points in increasing basic statistics, while the ~mutations~ represent passive bonuses that can be equipped and are unlocked once particular performances are achieved. These are basically perks that emerge by performing certain actions for a certain amount of time or by reaching other specific goals. Although the look and tone make it attractive to a varied audience, also made up of children, Grounded immediately offers a rather demanding challenge: accessibility is guaranteed by a clear interface and intuitive controls, but the progression still requires a lot of dedication. With the few tools that can be scraped together in the first few minutes of the game, it is not easy to face the numerous threats that inhabit the garden, with some ~evolutionary steps~ that are particularly long-standing, such as when the need emerges to face the larger and more aggressive insects to reach level 2 weapons and armor. In this regard, perhaps there is also a certain imbalance in the drop rate of construction elements (the ladybug head, to name one) which may seem almost unfair and frustrating at first. The crafting Grounded: The Bomber Beetle offers a tough challenge Faithful to the typical survival mechanics, crafting represents a fundamental element of Grounded, characterized by simple dynamics but which allow a significant amount of construction possibilities. In line with the children's science fiction spirit that characterizes the entire game, the new recipes are unlocked by analyzing the materials collected at the appropriate machines inside the various scientific laboratories left around by Ominent. For each ingredient you get various related recipes, as well as increasing our ~brain~ level, which is a way to match the progression of the character to new construction possibilities. The construction of weapons, armor, tools and survival support tools also takes place through the creation of the inevitable workbenches and various structures such as forges, spinning wheels, grinders and other specialized machinery that exponentially expand the objects to be created. The basic weapons and tools remain few and characterized by a rather simple upgrade system, but some additional facets are guaranteed by the recent introduction of the ~enchantment~ system, so to speak, i.e. the application of modifications based on food or various ingredients that give peculiar bonuses and able to make them more effective against some enemies. Very well done and complete, the whole sector relating to the construction of the bases is confirmed, a real game within the game for those who are passionate about these mechanics. Grounded offers a very extensive base building system Among the projects that are unlocked by analyzing ingredients and substances, many concern the basic elements for the construction of structures and buildings, which have a great variety thanks to the strange characterization of Grounded. Sticks, fresh and dry grass, clover leaves, acorns and many other mmaterials can result in modules to be composed in decidedly original ways, allowing for the design of daring constructions on several floors and with various outbuildings. Given the protagonists and the setting, then, it is not surprising that cobwebs, straw and similar elements can also be used to create trampolines, basketball hoops and other similar ornaments. The fights Grounded, some challenges are really very challenging The combat system was one of the most dubious elements in the Game Preview phase and essentially remained so even in the final version of Grounded, perhaps representing the weak point of the gaming experience. The general simplification sought by Obsidian to favor intuitiveness ends up making the clashes a little too chaotic, also because in the first person it is not easy to understand exactly the distances when using short-range weapons, while the third person is never convincing to make precise movements. However, the challenges have been enriched and expanded: with the various evolutions we have witnessed a significant increase in the types of enemies and weapons that have allowed a great expansion of the battle mechanics, which now offer a considerable variety between flying, aquatic or in able to strike from afar, imposing different and more complex strategies than we saw at the beginning of the course. A fantastic world Grounded and its particular point of view The modest size of the project is reflected above all on the technical side of Grounded, which appears far from a triple A mega-production of modern times, but which is however perfectly calibrated to the objective pursued by Obsidian. In short, the graphics of the game are consistent with the developed concept and with the chosen tone, adopting a sort of middle ground between a realistic and cartoonish look that manages very well to represent the world of the garden from the unprecedented perspective of miniaturized human beings. The quantity of elements on the screen is remarkable in the crossings between fields of grass, marshes, hedges, picnic tables and sandy expanses, with the chosen graphic style that manages to give coherence to everything in a very clear and characteristic vision. Of course, some uncertainties are sometimes noticed: the rendering of the materials is on average very good but in any case fluctuating, the animations of some creatures are decidedly less convincing than others and sometimes the effect on the depth of field loses a few hits in the most panoramic points. as well as the frame-rate, but in general it remains a good view, according to the cut chosen by the developers. As critical elements, we have detected some bugs related to the path finding of insects in areas rich in vegetation, with the possibility of seeing some get stuck larger creature and then see it mysteriously disappear. It is a known problem to the developers and a possible solution should already be included in the day one patch, so it may not be present in the final version released to the public. Furthermore, from the early days of the Game Preview to today, we were waiting to be able to see some changes in the weather conditions, instead it seems that these were not taken into consideration by Obsidian, who opted for a simple day / night cycle always set to the weather serene, net of any future updates.", "date": "2022-09-26", "grade": "8.3"}
