And in fact, the product we are going to talk about owes a lot in terms of inspiration to this last SEGA title specifically. The concept behind the game of The Bearded Ladies is in principle exactly the same as Crazy Taxi: stop, collect passengers on board the vehicle, take them to their destination perhaps by exploiting some power-ups collected along the way. Only here instead of a car there is a helicopter. The plot that characterizes the game is very simple and only serves to introduce the characteristic elements of the adventure: the thief of works of art Lander is shipwrecked on a remote island where he meets the bearded Marley, a Rastafarian who rescues him also proposing to help the criminal to return to civilization. Before going missing, Lander had stolen a series of sketches made by none other than Leonardo Da Vinci. Using these drafts, Marley builds what he calls Helivinci, a sort of pedal helicopter. Flying with pedals Thanks to this aircraft, the two unlikely companions will move from island to island crossing people looking for passages, enemies and obstacles along their way. The game takes place on six different islands each of which contains a series of missions and challenges of increasing difficulty. These missions range from the simple transport of people to the Crazy Taxi to the achievement of certain objectives passing to occasional ~fights~ with crazy flying opponents. The Helivinci is equipped with a healthbar which determines its health level; in fact, this bar decreases every time obstacles are touched or actions are performed that seriously damage the vehicle, such as for example trying to land in spaces that are not suitable for the purpose or at consistent speeds. To remedy the lighter damage during the flight it is possible to collect special power-ups that are used to repair the machine, give them boosts and better characteristics such as temporary greater speed or even increase the capacity of the healthbar. The controls of the aircraft are rather immediate and simple especially once you get the hang of it. Obviously, by raising the level of general difficulty or in particular game situations, mastering the helicopter can be a little difficult, but nothing particularly complicated. Returning to the discourse related to the missions, it must be said that these show a fairly varied structure; even those that are apparently similar such as the passenger transport phases have some goodies that diversify the gameplay. For example, in one of the first game sessions, a beautiful girl is expected to be taken on board the helicopter who, by pressing the appropriate button on the Pad (Circle), will attract male customers. Playstation 3 trophies There are 14 Trophies available in Landit Bandit. In detail: 11 of Bronze, 2 of Silver, 1 of Gold. While to scrape together the former it takes little or no effort, satisfying minimum requirements such as obtaining eight large wings or completing an entire level without suffering even one damage, for the others it will be necessary to work a little more since, for example, it is required to obtain all gold medals in each degree of difficulty. A world of colors As you progress in the adventure, other characters each equipped with their own specific skills will be aggregated to the duo of pilots, giving new characteristics to the vehicle. Among other things, some of these skills will be used to be able to reach particular otherwise inaccessible areas or to collect specific power-ups. If desired, there is also a vertical split-screen co-op mode available in the game at all times; a second user can in fact grab another controller and join the friend who is already facing the single-player campaign. In this case the missions will be automatically adapted to the case with the addition of more secondary characters, slightly more complex situations, etc. If desired, it is also possible to challenge each other 1Vs1 in a series of competitions which consist of a series of duels, precisely six, one for each island and with a variant theme. From a technical point of view, the Landit Bandit is an explosion of colours. The three-dimensional graphics are certainly not the maximum expression of the genre, but it is functional to the type of product. The environments then faithfully reflectnte the cartoonish and comical atmosphere of the adventure, and they vary from the typically tropical ones to the mountain ones complete with glaciers. Finally, without forgetting the characters, both the two protagonists and the secondary ones, all fairly well characterized and with an absolutely crazy look. Final note for the audio that presents ad hoc samples on the platform genre, with a soundtrack that presents a series of bases in which the bongo instrument prevails: simple but effective.", "date": "2010-08-12", "grade": "6.5"}
