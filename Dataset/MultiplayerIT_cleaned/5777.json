The title branded Avalanche Software is yes the only action dedicated to the film directed by J.J. Abrams, but is also accompanied by the new pinball machines made by Zen Studios. Continuing the collaboration with Disney which has already led to the publication of some tables set in the far distant galaxy of Star Wars, the development team has in fact put online the new contents of Zen Pinball 2, the name by which it is known in the ecosystem PlayStation what in other parts is called Pinball FX 2. Fortunately, what changes is the form but not the substance, given that the package can be purchased on all platforms for which the game is available. If you follow our pages constantly you will know that we like to look at all the new features that arrive in Zen Pinball 2: a tempting opportunity like the one offered by The Force Awakens, therefore, we could not let it get away. But let's not waste any more time and find out what's new! The Force Awakens becomes not one but two pinball machines with Zen Pinball 2! Good and bad As also happened on other occasions, the Zen Pinball 2 DLC dedicated to The Force Awakens brings with it two different pinball machines, within which the references to the Star Wars universe and in particular to the last film are very numerous. For this reason, for the avoidance of doubt, we recommend that you watch The Force Awakens before playing. The pair of new tables can be divided between the Light Side and the Dark Side: in the first we find Finn, Poe Dameron and Rey together with the inevitable droid BB-8, while in the second appear Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma and their First Order. In the case of the heroes of the light side, the setting is that of the planet Jakku, where the first part of the film takes place: the protagonists are committed to bringing BB-8 to safety from the attacks of enemy forces, without losing sight of the objective to accumulate as many points as possible. The first table is probably the simpler of the two, also from a conceptual point of view: the classic flippers at the bottom of the pinball machine are joined by two more placed in the upper part of the screen, allowing you to develop the game in a fairly classic way, taking advantage of the homogeneously available area. As in other Zen Studios tables, the wonders of the virtual pinball machine also lead us to face some mini-games: among these we find the one in which we have to take on the role of the spherical droid, to try to avoid the nets that are thrown at us and get a bonus whenever possible. The table dedicated to the Dark Side instead puts us on the trail of the forces of the Resistance to try to annihilate them, complete with the possibility of ~controlling~ a Star Destroyer. The most particular feature of this second pinball machine is represented by the presence of a double level of play, to be understood as such in a literal way: the table is in fact equipped with two different and overlapping ~planes~, complete with separate flaps. By hitting the appropriate target, it is possible to go down to the lower level to play a ~pinball machine within a pinball machine~, which requires a bit more skill and patience than the first table. Since they are quite close in the top view, sometimes you even end up confusing the flaps of the two levels, but luckily we can say that after a few games you get used to this type of design. Jujube broth For some, works like this are pure fan service, but when there is such a good realization behind it, we believe that there is nothing else to do but let yourself be pampered by your passions. What is written in the previous paragraph tells us that the two new Zen Pinball 2 pinball machines are well built, even before being a feast for the eyes and ears of all Star Wars lovers. Both tables are full of graphic elements taken from the latest film, for which the standards to which the guys at Zen Studios have accustomed us are now guaranteed. There are also some nice ideas in the graphic design, such as the choice to use Rey's speeder to put the ball into play. Regarding the character played by Daisy Ridley, the fact that it has been snubbed in other merchandising works based on the film has sparked some controversy, but fortunately this is not the case. Rey makes a fine show of herself both in the image that forms the background of her pinball machine, together with Finn, and with the animated model that, as per tradition, the developers have placed in some phases at the edges of the playing area. Along with her there is also all the rest of the main cast, including the MMillennium Falcon: By unlocking the right elements, we can find ourselves bouncing the ball while Han Solo's spaceship hurtles and fights in front of us. All with sounds and effects taken directly from the film, including the inevitable pew-pew-pew. At this point, there is very little to say to summarize: if you have Zen Studios' pinball machines installed on your reference platform and at the same time you love Star Wars, these are the new contents you were looking for. If vice versa The Awakening of the Force and the whole universe created by George Lucas make you neither hot nor cold, even within the same game you have more interesting alternatives.", "date": "2016-01-14", "grade": null}
