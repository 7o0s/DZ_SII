{"name": "Neon Abyss", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neon-abyss-recensione.html", "text": "Roguelikes have had a gigantic explosion in recent years and not a month goes by without some new production appearing. The formula, repeated endlessly, is always the same but the solutions to make it interesting are the strengths that distinguish one title from another. They showed us great things with Dead Cells, with Binding of Isaac, they amazed us by adding cards in Slay the Spire and lately they have pushed the accelerator by hybridizing roguelike and hack 'n' slash with Hades and Curse of the Dead Gods. In short, the genre is really full of small masterpieces and beyond the handful of titles just mentioned there is an entire undergrowth of other roguelikes capable of satisfying the most diverse tastes. The incredible thing in all of this is that the players still don't seem to be satisfied with it and with each new release they throw themselves headlong into it, consuming hours after hours without even realizing it. If the cyclical system of ~play - die - repeat~ works and attracts, then think what could happen if such a product arrived for free, perhaps relying on the escalation of Microsoft's Game Pass. The Neon Abyss review talks about a title that chooses precisely that path to make itself known, with a free release for subscribers and usable both from Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store. We, in order not to miss anything, have spent most of our last days on both versions and today we are ready to launch the final verdict: do we have another masterpiece in our hands? I do the last! One more and then I'll stop, I swear. This is the recurring phrase that anyone who has tried roguelikes has repeated more often and in short, the value of this type of game comes precisely from their ability to keep us glued to the screen for hours and hours in the vain hope that the next run will be the perfect one. Neon Abyss achieves this goal, we want to say it, and therefore it becomes complex to evaluate the title because in the face of an important goal like this achieved and overcome with enthusiasm, inside us at each new game annoying little voices underlined how something was not alright right place, but what exactly is difficult to say. So let's start with the story, taken for granted and almost not at all interesting with the Titan that must be stopped at all costs and a handful of characters, first to be unlocked and then to be controlled, determined to complete the dangerous dungeons that await us. Neon Abyss comes in two dimensions, with colorful graphics and a control system taken verbatim from the twin stick shooters, with the only difference being the left trigger used to make jumps. What awaits you in Neon Abyss is a series of square rooms populated by enemies ready to blow your brains out. Demonic eyes with wings, barbed beasts, killer bears and other creatures are ready to appear out of nowhere to block your advance, with a repetitiveness that unfortunately reveals itself after very few runs. In fact, what we just couldn't digest about the VEEWO GAMES title is the lack of variety of enemies and settings, often repeated with only color variations and with a procedural generation of the same that relies on too few creation seeds, giving a strong sense of deja vu that greatly lowers replay value. In fact, you will know the exact position of the platforms, the location of the secret rooms and all those little tricks that in other roguelikes are used as leverage to push the player to explore and to feel overwhelmed by new stimuli with each game. In this Neon Abyss fails heavily by failing to cool down and thus having to rely solely on its gameplay. Toast at the right point Fortunately, however, the gameplay is solid and well structured, with precise jumps and bonuses and power ups donated in large quantities to the player. The basic power-ups mainly serve to increase the number of bullets fired or the damage of the weapon but it is the various extreme power-ups that diversify the style of play and make you want to have more and more. There is no shortage of imaginative bonuses thanks to which you can forget about the platform phases and simply fly, others that prevent you from suffering damage from the, few, environmental traps and others, the fundamental ones to proceed quickly that allow you to shoot missiles and grenades in freedom. The explosions in Neon Abyss are in fact of fundamental importance both for their exaggerated damage and because they allow you to break through hidden walls and destroy stone blocks that often hide chests, health hearts or eggs. Once you have collected an egg it will faithfully follow you through the rooms until it has been hatched enough to hatch and reveal a mascotte inside, also a mere utility that serves to overcome the levels more easily. The variety of weapons is good even if none has remained particularly impressed since their balance leaves something to be desired at least. In short, Neon Abyss does its work without overdoing it, in a successful task but which could really become something more. There is a good management of resources, divided into hearts, coins and crystals, essential to gain access to different rooms and also small secret mini-games hidden in special areas that push you to fully explore the rather contained dungeons. In fact, we are talking about a dozen rooms at most before moving on to the next stage, with a difficulty curve that obviously fluctuates heavily depending on the power ups found with runs that may seem like hell fallen to earth when you don't find suitable power ups and others instead on which you will pass without the slightest effort. However, replayability is amplified by extra items dropped by end-of-level bosses that can be used to unlock further bonuses and new heroes through a simple branch growth system. As for the duration of the games, finally you can expect runs that will go from about thirty minutes up to sessions of more than an hour since every time you kill a boss at the end of the dungeon a new one will be added to the list for your next run , thus continuously multiplying the rooms to face before closing the challenge.", "date": "2020-07-20", "grade": "7.0"}
