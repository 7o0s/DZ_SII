{"name": "World of Warcraft: finalmente", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/world-of-warcraft-finalmente-la-recensione.html", "text": "War! As abundantly illustrated during the various previews that we have dedicated to it, World of Warcraft compensates with quality where it lacks for lack of innovation or particular originality. Yet we can identify a partially innovative element: the approach to the MMORPG genre. Following what is somewhat the trend in the sector, Blizzard has used its experience to package a game completely free of entry barriers, where even reading the manual is completely superfluous. In the process of creating a new alter-ego, very little is left to the player, beyond the choice of gender, race and class and once they come into the world, the monsters to kill are already there at hand, together with the handful of NPCs that act as an interlude and preparation for the more aggressive questing that we will be engaging in just a few minutes after the ~birth~. With a development parable of 60 levels, the differences between the style of the different players emerge rather late (around the 20th-25th) and depend on the selection of the so-called Talents. If the combat and work skills (mining, preparing potions, skinning animals, etc) improve with use, and the different powers peculiar to our character class depend exclusively on the level and size of our wallet, the Talents follow the philosophy that was of Diablo 2: at each level after the tenth one earns a point, it is up to us to decide how to spend it in the three different ~Talent trees~ of our character. War! These are not additional skills, but simply bonuses of various kinds, which if chosen following a coherent plan, are able to have a devastating impact on the performance of the character himself, outlining the optimal combat strategy and operating a sort of implicit customization (on balance the ~raw~ powers remain the same!). Wizards, for example, have different schools of magic, which can be summarized in enchantment, fire and ice. As his levels and the liquids in his pockets grow, a player will not fail to purchase all the ~upgrades~ available to his skills at the appropriate mage trainer, but it will be at his sole discretion to decide whether to spend the precious talent points to upgrade his magic of ice, fire, opt for a compromise or devote himself to something else. Similarly, a thief will have to choose whether to focus on increasing the effectiveness of his traditional hand-to-hand combat, improving the effects of his sneak attacks and poisons, or excelling in his ability to make himself invisible and move around hiding from the sight of monsters and players. One option does not exclude the other, but since the points are limited, for each class tend to emerge about two or three optimal ~templates~ or ~builds~, which deepen this or that macro-aspect of the character. You usually have an optimal setup for fighting monsters and a couple of particularly effective variations in Player versus Player, but while most players usually stick to the most popular development path, there is no shortage of surprises from those who constantly they explore new combinations to displace the opponent during a duel. It is even possible to ~unlearn~ the talents to change one's style of play simply by requesting it from the trainer of the respective class... although it is not a device to be abused since it costs money and with each subsequent request its price increases according to a geometric progression definitely not within the reach of all budgets. As we have said, the player is left with the sole responsibility of imparting the direction in which to express the potential of the character and of training himself in the use of his powers and in developing the tactics best suited to his style of play. In addition of course to the procurement of the appropriate equipment, without which WoW would certainly not be a role-playing game worthy of the name! The remaining elements of character development, such as increasing the effectiveness of his attacks, improving his physical characteristics and his health points, are fully automated. What makes the process of gathering experience so addictive is not so much the massacre of tens of thousands of mindless little monsters, but the fact that, although the growth is gradual, the difference between one level and another is extremely tangible and consistent. Monsters that were previously unreachable pass within our reach, objects that we could not previously wear become available, the feeling of becoming stronger and more resistant is real. Also the scientific distribution of the ~mobs~ in the different play areasaccentuates this feeling, because with each level-up, for each powerful monster that moves to a less demanding category for our abilities, a little further away there is already one capable of creating problems for us, ready to spur us on to improve further. The stimulus is therefore constant, you always know exactly what to do and stopping is damn hard! Better alone or badly accompanied? An MMORPG is also made up of other players, and where honorable duels, sneaky ambushes or glorious pitched battles don't find space, here we find the classic party of characters who travel together, helping each other in the accumulation of wealth, in killing monsters and in resolving of quests, as in the best tradition of role-playing games in all its media forms. The group logic in WoW is the traditional one: ranged attackers ~pull~ (attract) single monsters, warriors ~tank~ their shots keeping them busy, while the healers do careful work of putting their companions back on track and the classes more wicked they carry out the serial obliteration of the filthy creatures. Nothing new therefore, while the combat scenarios are instead interesting, which beyond the ~collective~ locations in which different groups compete for the procurement of ~things to do~, also include the so-called instance dungeons. The latter, characterized by a large vortex portal, are ~replicated~ game areas for each group or single character who ventures there, so that anyone intending to solve quests (typically elite, very difficult but lucrative) and collect treasures, he will have the entire dungeon at his disposal, as if he lived in a parallel dimension. Once you leave the portal, you return to the normal ~world~ shared by everyone. Although apparently cumbersome, this solution excels in elegance and simplicity in solving the classic ~camping~ problem of quests and respawn points, which in other games leads to absolutely surreal situations in which dozens of players literally queue in front of the super villain of the situation, each waiting his turn to kill him, while the poor guy is ~reborn~ every few minutes only to be slaughtered on the fly by the first in line. To be fair, it should be specified that World of Warcraft is not the kind of MMORPG in which being in a group is a fundamental requirement in order to progress at an acceptable pace. A good 80% of the game is perfectly usable without any help, indeed a player who knows his stuff knows well that the fastest way to gain experience is just the ~quest running~ alone and the ~grinding~ (killing in series) of creatures a couple of levels higher than your own, always alone. Better alone or badly accompanied? The exception are instance dungeons, but their limited number and objective difficulty, even for close-knit groups, make them more suitable as places to stock up on high-quality equipment and to search for good-calibre quests, rather than as well as sources of experience to collect. Collaboration between players is more relevant in other areas. Participating in a raid (group invasion of the opposing faction's territory) is a highly spectacular experience, especially when your opponents are organized and offer resistance. Furious melees where brawny Orcs and towering Tauren battle their Covenant counterparts, while the ghostly silhouettes of Rogues stalk silently across the battlefield illuminated by the lightning and explosions caused by the spellcasters. Although some PvP potential of World of Warcraft remains untapped for the moment (the add-on related to the battlefields, with support for vehicles and war machines, is still a long way off), at present a good level character he is already able to enjoy an extremely satisfying online competition experience, provided he joins a well-organized guild, which operates an efficient policy of sharing knowledge and equipment. From the point of view of social interactions, the game does not offer many tools, also due to a trading system that is not particularly evolved (the trading skills are all rather elementary, as is the manufacturing method of the objects). Everything is essentially left to the imagination of the players, but some elements however, such as the auction houses, have built a small economy that revolves around the sale of magical objects. Seeing dozens of characters crowding the counter at the Orgrimmar auction house, insulting each other for skyrocketing the price of any minimally palatable trifle is surely a good example of a metagame World of Warcraft can be rightly proud, given the overall simple mechanics that govern it. A world of things Anyone with a minimum smattering of fantasy culture and literature would be able to identify the different sources from which the magnificent puzzle of the Warcraft setting has taken shape over the years. A mosaic whose pieces, from the all too explicit references to Tolkien and the world of Warhammer, to more refined details inspired by the novels R.A. Salvadore, manage to blend in harmonious accord, giving life to a vast land, alive and vivid in our imagination, perhaps precisely because it is so close to the fantastic things we have read, played and loved over the years. Considering World of Warcraft outside of its setting would be meaningless, because the latter, far from being a simple decorative frame, intervenes in the gameplay and is perhaps its most characterizing element compared to competing titles. The thousands of quests, carefully displayed with abundant use of words and background hints from hundreds of NPCs, expertly draw a linear but compelling plot, which, depending on the race and faction to which they belong, integrates with different aspects of the storyline of the world. For example, the Undead of the Horde, renegade creatures hunted on one side by the Scourge of the Lich King and on the other by the forces of the Alliance, are studying how to create and spread a new lethal epidemic for both the living and the dead. In this ~high-level~ context, which affects the plot of the game itself, there is also space for our ~little~ characters, actively involved in the search for purulent ingredients and cookbooks of crazy sorcerers, well encouraged to roam the world in far and wide to find them, accumulating experience and equipment without almost realizing it. In fact, the interest capable of arousing the constant succession of large and small quests is an element of capital importance in the player's habituation process and if the farming of NPCs does not stimulate you, just discovering further details of this land so rich in details should be plenty to keep you glued to the screen long enough to have the right character for your warlike aspirations. A world of things Furthermore, World of Warcraft is a real fantasy encyclopedia and has an absolutely impressive assortment of ~entities~ in play; whether they are monsters or objects, any element with a Tolkenian flavor can come to your mind, rest assured that you will find it in the game. The range of equipment is extremely varied, following a nomenclature similar to that used in Diablo 2, in which different objects but with similar characteristics are grouped according to the particular name they bear (Explorer's gloves and boots, and so on). Most of the most valuable objects are naturally single, but finding one or more portions of a ~set~ particularly suited to one's character class is one of the goals of every player. Obviously the lack of a random generation of skills and characteristics of the objects greatly reduces their overall variety, but if you have the perseverance to continue in the game you really see them of every shape and color. The same goes for monsters and creatures: from the classics of fantastic literature to some original inventions of Blizzard, the setting is so rich that in a sense there is always something new to kill, even if it is possible to glimpse a predictable but fully justifiable ~reuse~ scheme, where enhanced versions of weaker monsters populate different areas of the world with the only difference being a more ominous name and a worryingly higher level than ours. Conclusions Masterpiece? Far from perfect, World of Warcraft simply imposes itself as the best in class, at least when it comes to swashbuckling MMORPGs. If there were flaws in competitors' products, Blizzard analyzed and corrected them, aggressively incorporating external know-how and expertly blending it with its experience, resulting in the ideal MMORPG for both the newbie and the hardcore gamer, a anything but simple goal for a genre that for more than five years has remained relegated to the niche of the irreducible. A profound, satisfying and terribly addictive title, suitable for those who live significant portions of their real existence in virtual worlds, but which lends itself just as well to being played ~quietly~ for an hour in the evening a day, without incurring any kind of penalty.
