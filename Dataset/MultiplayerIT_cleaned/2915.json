{"name": "Super Bomberman R Online", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-bomberman-r-online-recensione.html", "text": "Today everything is transformed into battle royale, the most successful genre among the masses and, as we will see in the course of the Super Bomberman R Online review, sometimes what seems absurd on paper can instead turn out to be an excellent idea. The Bomberman series was born in 1983 on 8-bit systems (MSX, ZX Spectrum, then NES) and since then, despite mixed success, has never left the world of video games. So to say, Nintendo Switch launched with Super Bomberman R, one of the first hits of the hybrid console, and now Stadia has gotten its exclusive Bomberman completely online. The game formula is always the same: one or more players guide characters capable of placing bombs that explode after a few moments. The goal is to kill the enemies on the map, whether they are monsters driven by the CPU or other humans, by investing them with the explosion. Gameplay Super Bomberman R Online isn't the first installment in the series to have a competitive mode, but it's definitely the only one where 64 players can compete against each other. Konami's designers have been brilliant in conceiving a game system that avoids chaos, while maintaining the spirit of the series. Players compete in arenas contained on a single screen, part of a system of sixteen arenas arranged in a square (four on each side). After a minute from the start of the fight, some arenas are eliminated and the surviving players must run to one of those that remain active, where they will fight for another round. Gradually the number of arenas becomes increasingly small, until only one remains, that of the final match, where the absolute winner will be determined. At the beginning of each round the arenas are filled with the classic destructible walls, often filled with bonuses to collect such as the explosion extension, the bomb multiplier, as well as super bombs capable of passing through walls or rolling bombs to throw at the opponents. Each selectable character, aside from those from the Bomberman family, also has a unique special ability. For example Alucard can turn into mist to fly over bombs or explosions, Contra protagonists can shoot bombs, Pyramid Head can kill other players by touch, and so on. Furthermore, each one has different characteristics, which consist in the amount of basic bonuses that can be redeemed (explosion width, number of bombs and movement speed), as well as in the possibility or not of using special upgrades. Each player has two lives available, after which he is excluded from the game. If desired, it is possible to recover a life by finding it hidden in the walls or by collecting it after eliminating another player. When you take out all the players in a single arena you become the ruler of the area and get a large amount of bonuses to collect. Depending on the position reached, at the end of the match experience points are obtained which level up, unlocking the classic cosmetic objects with which to customize the characters (costumes, emotes, poses and so on). Graphics There isn't much left to say about Super Bomberman R Online, in the sense that it ends in its only game mode (if we don't count the possibility of playing with friends) and in the unlocking of cosmetic items, some of which are linked to the classic season pass ( now inevitable in such titles). Even technically it is really essential: the arenas are framed from above with the fixed camera and, in principle, it seems that the developers have favored the readability of the action over all the rest, thus not weighing down the graphics with superfluous details or with you find scenographic of sorts. If we had to use a word to describe it, we would certainly choose ~functional~, given the effort made to avoid the action becoming chaotic as much as possible. The best part, at least visually, are definitely the characters, also essential in modeling, but fun in their characterization. The music is certainly better: a selection of songs taken from the Konami series, some of which can be unlocked as a bonus.", "date": "2020-09-06", "grade": "8.0"}
