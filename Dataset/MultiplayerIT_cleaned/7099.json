Monochroma, so called due to the particular style already appreciated in other productions such as Betrayer and the original SuperHot, where red enhances some details in a world dominated by shades of gray, is a horizontally scrolling puzzle platform strongly linked to physics and with two exceptional inspiring muses, namely the beautiful Limbo by the Danish Playdead and the ICO masterpiece by Fumito Ueda. The juxtaposition with the first work is evident in any promotional material distributed to date, while with the second, beyond the emphasis placed on emotional involvement, it should be read in the relationship between the two protagonist brothers, with the younger, wounded , closely resembling Yorda in its influence on game mechanics. The fil rouge that links Monochroma with the aforementioned productions has never been hidden by the authors, who have explicitly exalted it as a strong point on several occasions, however leveraging on some elements that underline the originality and personality of the project. Just think of the strong message of social responsibility that permeates the entire production, inspired by the violent protests of Gezi in Turkey in 2013 and which denounces, among other things, the values of the liberal economy, the exploitation of minors in the world of work and the destruction of the environment in favor of industry. Noble intentions which, however, being a pure video game, must in any case be linked to purely playful parameters, where the work of Nowhere Studios unfortunately fails to shine as much as from the point of view of ideas and the artistic component. In the next paragraphs we will explain why. Monochroma is an interesting platformer/puzzler that sadly fails to excel Those shady characters Set in the 50s in a dystopian future, sometimes touched by steampunk elements, Monochroma puts us in the shoes of a couple of very young brothers who have become uncomfortable witnesses of a (horrible) crime committed by a ruthless corporation, whose turnover based on the commercialization of curious domestic robots. The story, told only by the images in the game, begins with the two intent on chasing each other and playing with a red kite among endless cornfields, immersed in a rural and poetic but also deeply melancholic atmosphere. In this short sequence, placed before the sudden dramatic turn, the developers wanted to pay homage to their childhood memories, linked to bucolic landscapes still untouched by the steam and metal brought later by industrialization. The boys, happy and carefree, in a parallelism with the painful passage of an era, run into a sudden fall which causes the injury of the youngest, forcing the older brother to take care of him by carrying him on his shoulders: there are no ~boys with horns~ nor mysterious hidden fortresses, but from that moment on anyone who has played Fumito Ueda's masterpiece will experience a subtle - how pleasant - feeling of deja vu. The road backwards is unfortunately impracticable and the meeting with the first shady figure of the aforementioned corporation transforms the couple's bad day into a real nightmare; a constant escape into the unknown that spans four different game worlds (Suburbs, Ghetto, Industry and Zeppelin) and dozens of environmental puzzles to overcome. As specified in the introduction, Monochroma is a physics-based side-scrolling puzzle platformer, whose mechanics closely resemble those of Limbo: in fact, there are levers to press, boxes to move, mechanisms to activate, platforms to reach and more obstacles. or less ingenious to get around, requiring wit, intelligence, and often great timing too. However, the fulcrum around which most of the puzzles revolve is linked to the transport of the younger brother, unable to move independently and, above all, afraid of the dark, thus being able to be ~parked~ momentarily in the only and rare illuminated areas. Furthermore, when the eldest - controlled by the player - is not engaged in nannying, he is much more agile and light, and it is on all these characteristics thatthe developers have shaped the structure of the gameplay, sometimes with brilliant and ingenious solutions, other times too ~trial and error~ oriented, frustrating in the mechanics or unnecessarily laborious. A precise and responsive control system is also essential to obtain the desired results in a product of this kind, but unfortunately in Monochroma not only are the controls wooden and not very suitable for the millimeter jumps required, but it can happen that the physical system misfires transforming some trivial sequences into real nightmares. There is nothing more frustrating than brilliantly passing a well-studied puzzle, and dying (continuously) in the immediately following scene because, for example, jumping while sliding from a sloping lean-to is unnecessarily complex. Fortunately, the clever distribution of checkpoints manages to limit the damage in part. It is possible to play both with the keyboard and with the Xbox 360 joypad, but with the latter, curiously not indicated in any game menu, we encountered one of the most absurd bugs we have ever encountered, which prevented us from the continuation of the story. In a nutshell, using the aforementioned peripheral our character was unable to cling to a simple protrusion (the roof of a boat), while performing the same action with the keyboard everything went smoothly. We hope that this incredible bug will be fixed before the release on Steam, which we remember will take place on May 28th. During the course of the adventure, characterized by some twists and turns and whose longevity is around 6 hours of play, exciting, intense and well-thought-out phases alternate with other frustrating and unnecessarily cumbersome ones, which partially break the magic and the atmosphere that permeate the entire Turkish production. Deep red As for the basic game mechanics, also from an exquisitely artistic point of view, the title of Nowhere Studios is deeply inspired by the work of Playdead, especially as regards the general atmosphere which is melancholy and gloomy; nevertheless, in addition to the pinch of red - and rarely of others - which paints some elements in a world in shades of gray, in Monochroma a decidedly more substantial polygonal mass is evident, where the architectures in the background, sometimes animated, are often complex and full of details. There are carpentry shops, shopping malls, factories, interiors and exteriors of apartments, moving vehicles and much more; glimpses of an alternative 1950s that not only offer a decent sense of variety, but which often form the basis of the most interesting environmental puzzles. Just think of the fire that breaks out inside a building, the cistern to be filled with water to escape certain death or the game of elevators in a section of the second world. However, the painstaking artistic care is contrasted by the woodiness of the animations, sometimes linked to a poorly optimized ragdoll that makes the most grim death sequences hilarious and ridiculous. As far as the graphic settings are concerned, beyond the classic resolution, it is only possible to set a generic quality level (from low to high) and the full screen, furthermore to overcome the tearing from which the game suffers it is necessary to force the v-sync with external solutions. The soundtrack created by the folk band Gevende is good, in most cases characterized by melancholy themes that go well with the topics covered and with the almost constant rain that wets the scenarios. The sound effects, on the other hand, are limited to carrying out their homework, with samples with a generally not very incisive timbre.", "date": "2014-05-26", "grade": "6.5"}
