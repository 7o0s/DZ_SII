Bethesda has promised that a fix patch will be available on Monday July 16th. To launch the new Dawnguard storyline, it is sufficient to have a tenth level character and take him to one of the main cities. After a brief and cryptic dialogue we leave for the bersagliera, heading towards the immense Fort Dawnguard where the vampire hunters recruit us without delay. And here, in less than no time, we find ourselves launched into a new mission that takes us into the middle of a conflict between vampires and hunters. A real war that will force us to side with one of the two factions forcing us to choose whether to become a new Van Helsing or an evil and very powerful vampire lord. The moral issue here is very clear: vampires are evil while hunters represent the light. But behind the shadows of eternal conflict lies something more important, as we discover upon meeting Serana, a talkative and buxom vampire who carries an ~ancient scroll~ on her back. The undead girl is a crucial piece of the story and, among other things, is well characterized through various and decidedly ironic dialogues that make exploration less tiring. But this is not the only gem of the first Skyrim expansion which also gives us new skills, new legendary dragons, horseback combat, some new spells and the possibility of changing the features of the character, provided that this is not a creature supernatural. Back to Skyrim The expansion includes a series of key quests and several side missions for a total of about 20 hours of gameplay divided along two different paths. The most classic and least exciting experience is undoubtedly that of the vampire hunter. But exterminating villains in the name of an absolutist order is almost always a fun perversion, at least in a video game. There is also no shortage of new monsters such as the gargoyle and several new versions of monsters already seen to be beaten to recover a series of new objects which include the powerful vampiric armor. In any case, the protagonist of the expansion is undoubtedly the vampire. With Dawnguard, for the first time in The Elder Scrolls series, vampires enjoy the attention they deserve thanks to a dedicated storyline, which sees bloodsuckers engaged in conquest, and thanks to the implementation of a real skill tree (implemented, for a level playing field, even for werewolves). The new skills are well differentiated from the spells and powers already present in the title and offer very interesting possibilities such as the ability to transform, to perceive all creatures in a given area and to summon a gargoyle. For the transformations of the vampire, Bethesda has chosen the classic ones of horror cinema with the lord of the night who can turn into a quick cloud of bats or an intangible fog. But the ~non~ life of the vampire is not all feasts based on blood and also involves some sacrifices. First, when in vampiric form, magic doesn't work, which could be a problem for a spellcaster. Fortunately, the vampire leads as a blacksmith and can unlock a healing power that prevents us from continuous transformations in order to restore health. The second sore point concerns the terrified and violent reaction of the population who find themselves in the presence of a bloodsucking monster with two red eyes like traffic lights. Therefore, before making the transformation to face a fight in public, it is good to carefully weigh the consequences. Xbox 360 goals Dawnguard includes a number of new achievements for a total of 250 points. As with everything concerning Skyrim, unlocking them is only a matter of time, except perhaps for the Legendary Dragon which, without resorting to the shortcuts well known to Skyrim players, requires a fair amount of effort. Immersed in darkness Most of the missions are set in narrow, long and dark caves that nestle in the few remaining places on the Skyrim map. Our task is to clear these areas of enemies, solve any puzzles and visit the next dungeon. In short, excluding new skills, the global experience does not change much compared to what we have seen, and experienced, in Skyrim. Luckily in Dawnguard there is no shortage of spectacular views, such as the huge Dawnguard Fort and the gloomy Volkihar Castle, and nothing short of epic moments, such as the fight in the mountains with two legendary dragons. Furthermore, even the secondary novelties, although they are certainly not transcendental, ithey affect the gameplay. Mounted combat makes it possible to face enemies with melee weapons even without having a particularly powerful character. In fact, the possibility of escaping makes everything much easier even if it lengthens the timing of the clashes. Magic, on the other hand, is forbidden to horsemen and it is therefore impossible to heal without resorting to potions. But even when holding a single melee weapon, both attack keys are still needed, which allow you to choose whether to slash on the right or left side of the quadruped. Unfortunately, the difficulty of maneuvering and the lack of moves do not allow you to make the most of this new possibility which could and should be implemented with greater care. On the contrary, everything runs smoothly with ranged weapons that become even more lethal in the saddle than they already were in Skyrim. In fact, now it is possible to keep even the fastest monsters at a safe distance and it is no longer necessary to find expedients to block the most resistant opponents, often using glitches. Basically Dawnguard offers a lot of additional content even if not all of the same quality level. Furthermore, the European version seems to be plagued by various bugs, from the invisibility of monsters to the freeze of the console and down to the dreaded floating underpants. A horror that takes us back in time, to the early tumultuous days of Skyrim, even if we, fortunately, have mostly encountered naked vampires. Initially, by the way, we even found ourselves thinking that naturism was a normal custom of this particular bloodsucking faction. In short, the 1600 Microsoft Points requested by Bethesda appear decidedly excessive even if the approximately twenty hours of gameplay included in this first expansion undoubtedly represent an excellent excuse to return once again to the lands of Skyrim.", "date": "2012-07-13", "grade": null}
