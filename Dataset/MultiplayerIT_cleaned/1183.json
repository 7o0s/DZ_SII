{"name": "Pikmin 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pikmin-2.html", "text": "The smell of money In fact, Olimar's return to his native soil does not happen as he had probably imagined: instead of a party in his honor, what confronts him is the bankruptcy of the galactic transport company for which he works, submerged in debt. Fortunately, a solution exists. For some strange reason, in fact, objects and knickknacks of all kinds that have very little value for earthlings, can be sold handsomely on Olimar's planet. The brave captain, without thinking twice, therefore decides to retrace his steps in the eager search for as much material as possible to avert the sad end of the company... but this time, the weight of the mission is not destined to rest on his shoulders. Yes, because Pikmin 2 immediately introduces one of the major innovations compared to its predecessor, namely the company of the not too smart colleague Louie, however perfectly capable of doing everything that Olimar can do. The presence of the new co-protagonist immediately reveals itself to be much more than that of a simple companion, introducing a very useful component of contemporary resource management into the Nintendo title  and by resources, we obviously mean the Pikmin. In other words, it is possible both to move in a group with the Olimar-Louie couple side by side, and to separate the latter thus having control of two distinct units, which can be recalled immediately by pressing a button on the controller. The result is obvious: a classic example can see Olimar and ~his~ Pikmin busy breaking down a wall, while Louie at the same time orders the little creatures to collect some flowers and bring them back to the shuttle to thus expand the ~army~. But obviously this is only one of the many situations that it is possible to encounter. However, the innovations introduced by this second chapter do not stop here. Those who have already played the previous episode will surely remember the 3 races of pikmin present: red, yellow and blue. Reds, the most common variety, have roughly average attack and speed stats, and are immune to fire. The yellows, weak but light, can be thrown higher and do not suffer from electricity. Lastly, the blues, very weak in clashes with enemies, are however the only ones able to cross streams and puddles, fatal instead for the other races. To these, Pikmin 2 also adds purples and whites, essential for dealing with the new situations proposed by this adventure. The former, endowed with a physical strength 10 times greater than the others but very slow in moving; the latter, immune to poison and lethal if ingested by enemies, but very weak. As if that weren't enough, these 2 new races cannot be raised like the others, i.e. bringing flowers and corpses to the ships, but on the contrary they will be recovered exclusively inside the caves which represent another novelty of Pikmin 2. The caves, scattered on the surface of the levels and reachable through unsavory dark and narrow craters, they are made up of successions of more or less extensive ~floors~ to be rummaged from top to bottom in search of precious treasures. Obviously, these places are also heavily populated by hostile creatures, determined to eliminate as many pikmin as possible... A world in the garden One of the most fascinating aspects in Nintendo's production is certainly the setting adopted, which is none other than the world we know, however, seen from the eyes of the very small beings under our control. Therefore, flowers are over 10 times the size of a pikmin, insects represent a very serious threat, puddles are almost insurmountable obstacles and so on... The poetic pleasure of this ~perspective~ is difficult to describe, and must be experienced firsthand; fact that once you start playing, the hours will flow really, really quickly, exploring real mini-worlds in search of caps, buttons, fruits, gloves, sweets but also floppy disks, lipsticks, blackboard chalks, keys and whoever the more he has the more he puts on. The graphics appear as a shining result of both excellent style and excellent knowledge of the hardware: while not leaving you speechless like a Resident Evil 4, just to give an example, Pikmin 2 is a technically splendid title in the round. Anchored frame rate, bright and defined textures, animations of surprising variety and top level of detail; frankly we couldn't ask for better. In support of such an inspired aesthetic component, however, there is a game mechanic that defining excellent would probably be an understatement. The Gamecube pad, beautifully mapped in the controls, thus becomes the interface to enter a world of pure playability. Call up your pikmsin, send them to attack a voracious carnivorous plant, or even have them build a bridge, knock down a wall, collect an object, are just some of the ingredients of a recipe with a superfine flavor for the palate of every gamer worthy of the name. Pikmin 2 is a game to be enjoyed, capable of continuously stimulating without ever forcing even a hint of frustration. Having eliminated the unbearable 30-day limit of the first chapter, this sequel therefore represents the concept of ~enjoyability~ in all its facets. The masterpiece, because this is what it is about, made in Nintendo in all probability will not become a blockbuster and will not be able to collect sensational sales figures, but without a shadow of a doubt it will enter the heart of every lucky person who will have the opportunity to play it. Lastly, the explosive multiplayer component should be mentioned, capable of pushing even further a longevity already guaranteed not only by the durable main adventure, but also by a truly stimulating challenge mode. Comment Pikmin had surprised everyone a bit, taking the real-time strategy genre and adapting it to Nintendo's way of seeing things. 3 years later, Pikmin 2 succeeds in correcting practically all the flaws of the first chapter, returning a product that defining a video game appears to be a lack of respect for it. Certainly it will not be the title destined to move the masses, but this by its very nature: Pikmin 2 does not scream, it whispers. It's not surprising, it charms. It doesn't stun, it kidnaps. And it passes lightly, on tiptoe, but overflowing with the strength that only masterpieces possess. Pros: A monument to gameplay Excellent graphics style Excellent longevity Cons: For many but not for all Second Comment Luckily there is the GameCube. Because in the originality, refinement and unique atmosphere that pervades Pikmin 2, the presence of an author, an inspiration, a rare vision capable of combining commercial needs with personal poetics is evident. The video game thus claims the status of a work even before a product. Miyamoto's team has not only refined and enriched the prequel, but have further refined the slightly surreal and bittersweet aesthetic, the immersive experience that is the strong point of the game. Improvements such as the tandem of characters, the freedom to act without time restrictions and the addition of new types of Pikmin, game modes and dungeons in the levels make the mechanics more enjoyable, articulated and complete. But it is the inclusion of the beautiful database, where you can carefully observe enemies and recovered objects, that reinforces the feeling of really living in another but possible world. A plausible parallel world where a work glove, a directional cross and a floppy, for tiny visitors, become a sleeping bag for five, a monument to glory and a cosmic archive. Where the monetary mission of exploration gives way to the ecstasy of observation, in Olimar's diary as in the player. And where the fauna and flora claim their own habitats, taxonomies and zoological dramas, devouring and being devoured in the bittersweet atmosphere that the environments and sounds offer. The signature of the authors also transpires from the concept, from the quasi-apology of teamwork, with the prevalence of the community over the individual and the existence of leaders and workers: explicit components of the plot and game situations, always faced facetiously yet with an almost paideutic intent. Pikmin 2 is therefore a work before a product, one of the best titles of this playful generation. To the single player it offers hours and hours of happy wandering in its fairy-tale and terrible world. For two players it provides potentially infinite challenges: putting aside the attempt to build cooperative modes with dubious success, it focuses everything on the challenge to the last Pikmin and builds one of the most successful and original multiplayer action / strategy since Lemmings. Score: 9 Marco Benoit Carbone Released on the market in the first months of the Gamecube's life, Pikmin was one of the clearest and most gaudy manifestos of the Nintendo-difference. Imperfect, I agree, but at the same time as engaging and challenging as few other games of this generation of consoles. The concept, as legend has it, was born from the brilliant mind of Miyamoto observing a group of ants at work in his garden. That was just the input, of course, then processed into what we know: a small real-time strategic masterpiece. In the first episode, poor Captain Olimar unfortunately found himself crashing his spaceship on planet Earth. Precisely on that occasion, when desperation seemed to have the upper hand, he made acquaintance with the people of the Pikmin,small and very tender beings available to the point of putting themselves at the complete service of the unfortunate astronaut. And so, picking up one piece after another, he managed to rebuild the ship and set off for home. But of course, the problems were far from over", "date": "2004-10-15", "grade": null}
