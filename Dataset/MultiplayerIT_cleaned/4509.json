Emotionally stimulated by the No TAV protests experienced firsthand in Val di Susa and artistically by that Capybara masterpiece that responds to the name of Sword and Sworcery, Leonard has aimed high announcing that he is able to create an aesthetically wonderful and content impeccable. And the market proved him right, given that in just a few weeks he managed to bring home more than double the money requested in crowdfunding. A funding campaign that already at that time pales in comparison to the requests of many other independent projects, being of just $20,000, but which today would probably also be hardly credible considering the development costs of today's market. And indeed something must have happened during the genesis of the game because after the first announcements of a demo and the final release later that year, and only one new video with some additional information during 2015, the title remained wrapped in a halo of mystery dragging itself through a probably very complex stage of development. Today we're talking about it because, surprisingly, we were finally able to test the semi-final version which, just as you're reading these lines, is available in early access on Steam at the price of 12.99. Follow us in the next paragraphs because we will try to make you understand what RIOT - Civil Unrest is concretely and if it was worth waiting so long to be able to play it. ACAB The central nucleus of the game is composed of a single player campaign divided into four different scenarios, each self-conclusive in terms of story and told events and composed of a variable number of schemes for a total of 16 levels. Each of these can be tackled by deploying and controlling rioters, or by managing the ranks of the police force, effectively doubling the total number of playable scenarios. The two sides bring completely different game mechanics to each other which concern not only the actual gameplay once they take to the streets, but also the preparation phase for urban warfare. The agitators foresee an initial phase in which their team is composed in terms of flags and banners, body protection, hostilities and training. Working on these four variables changes not only the attitude of the demonstrators and their stage presence but also the actual number of people who will participate in the protest. It is also possible to choose four different gadgets that the rioters will bring with them: here the choice ranges from urban guerrilla tools such as Molotov cocktails, firecrackers and stones to defense objects or more general utilities such as the megaphone to group people in a specific point, the laser pens to disturb the police, maalox to reduce the effects of tear gas or the use of social media to bring reinforcements during the protest, sometimes even in the form of media presence. In the case of the cops, on the other hand, the initial management phase is more similar to that of a real-time strategy game with heroes. In fact, we will have to configure the composition of the six squadrons, divided into assault, ballistic and tactical units, setting for each one the armour, the weapon slung (being able to opt for live ammunition as well), a possible equipped object (smoke or stun bombs, or a radio to create discipline in the ranks and more) and the possible protection mask. In this case, the composition of each unit will have a precise cost in points which will determine the final budget of the police deployment which, in turn, will determine the number of demonstrators taking to the streets. In both cases it is a basic system of causes and effects that must be taken into account and which in some way also affects the level of difficulty of the scenario: the more we decide to take the field equipped and armored, the more resistant the other side will be . Once the level has started, the actual game is controlled as a sort of strategic one: protestants and police are divided into groups that we can move to make them reach certain positions, while the front keys of the joypad and the digital cross are dedicated to use of gadgets or the advanced management of the group to set, for example, the formation or the degree of hostility on the ground. In reality, we soon realize that the real-time strategy mechanics are strongly influenced, and at times heavily managed, by artificial intelligence which not only controls the forces of the opposite side, but alsoIt also undermines the attitude of one's own faction. Situations of panic, charges or attempts to break through the police cordon are only partially in the player's hands since much more often the crowds and military units will move in total autonomy and often even in a disorganized way reacting to what is happening around them. them or resulting completely unusable if not adequately equipped or stimulated to be more aggressive. For example, it will not infrequently find yourself with two or three groups of rioters completely immobile in front of a police formation because they are unable to break through it and with all the gadgets that, concretely, fail to worry the armed force. Just as, on the other hand, you will find yourself having to deal with people running wild in all directions and who are really difficult to ~chase~ and bring back into line. One often feels the sensation of not really being in control of the situation and, if on the one hand it is true that this gives a feeling absolutely in line with the idea of simulating a very tense scenario of civil revolt, on the other it tends to generate a feeling of frustration linked to an idea of pure randomness as regards the outcome of the game. In this sense, the management of missions does not help, which always results in completing a very basic objective (remaining in a position, breaking through a barrier, preventing some type of damage...) within a certain fairly short period of time. To be clear, we have not seen game situations go beyond five minutes. And even the controls seem to give us their since, despite the genre of belonging, it is extremely more comfortable, intuitive and above all reactive to play RIOT - Civil Unrest with a joypad instead of with the combination of mouse and keyboard. The riot of pixel art If in terms of gameplay the title has not convinced us completely, there is nothing to criticize as regards the artistic aspect of the game. RIOT - Civil Unrest is an exceptional exponent of pixel art and while remaining a little distant from the peaks of excellence achieved by Sword and Sworcery, especially as regards the attention to detail of the models and scenarios, in terms of animations and variety of environments, Menchiari's title is simply unrivalled. It is therefore a pity that such great attention to the artistic aspect, above all as regards the video representation of the riots and guerrilla actions with consequent devastation of the urban furnishings, is not accompanied by a noteworthy narrative insight or in any case by the will to tell in greater detail what really happened in the four digitally recreated events. In short, it seems that the theme always and only remains very distant, in the background, to justify the setting of these tactical skirmishes; a simple ploy to be able to simulate the behavior of crowds in a scenario that tends to be chaotic and almost anarchic. Even the transition from one mission to the next within the scenario has a single ~score~ management dynamic which tends to reward non-aggressive behavior by assigning a military and political value to the player's and computer's efforts to then build any bonuses and next level malus. However, the idea of the front page of the newspaper that summarizes the outcome of the battle is interesting even if everything is resolved in a few sentences assembled automatically. The musical accompaniment with rock tones is not very noteworthy, while the effort made in the sampling of the audio effects is appreciable, which often bring back choirs and incitements apparently extracted from real demonstrations. At the end of the article, it is also important to say a few words also about the content offered in this early access which appears to be truly respected in the literal sense by RIOT. In fact, it seems that this version is in all respects an early access to a practically definitive title which at this stage only needs a slight adjustment and some refinement. In terms of content, in addition to the campaign already described above, the title offers a multiplayer component capable of supporting up to four players and the option to create entire, completely customized games within a much larger number of scenarios than those considered in the campaign. Furthermore, the game already includes an editor that allows you to create any battle from scratch using all the game's assets. It is certainly an addition to be commended but which requires a huge effort before we can make sensible additional content. RIOT - Civil Unrest rThere remains an independent title that is really very complex to judge. From a content point of view, it offers a lot, even if the campaign is rather quick to complete, and from an artistic point of view, the great work done by Leonard Menchiari and his team to try to push pixel art to the maximum is truly evident. At the same time we would have expected perhaps a little more as regards the ~social~ aspect of this project and the strategic mechanics put in place did not fully convince us. Nonetheless, we feel like rewarding this early access which, as it presents itself, is absolutely representative of a product that is complete and perfectly playable from start to finish.", "date": "2017-12-06", "grade": null}
