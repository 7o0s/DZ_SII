The first announcement of the partnership that would have linked the developers of Oxeye Game Studio and Mojang dates back to 2011, but over time the project has often been stopped in the pits, never going beyond the very first alpha version. The last postponement, which took place during the autumn, had the aim of optimizing the contents and refining the last details. After many vicissitudes and in the absence of new creative ideas of depth - we talked about it here - Mojang has therefore also managed to make its debut as a publisher, with a product that at first glance might seem similar to many others but in reality has various singular characteristics. Cobalt is in fact a 2D platformer with shooter elements in which there is an alternation between multiple methods of interaction and fighting styles, supported in turn by mechanics of evading attacks through a slow motion technique. All of this is enclosed in a campaign that can be experienced both in single-player and in cooperative with another player, during which the efficient agent Cobalt is in charge of discovering what has happened to mankind in a remote colony lost in Space. What's more, the game also provides several additional activities, offering a multitude of frenetic multiplayer arcade modes and a series of challenges complete with online leaderboards. Oxeye Game Studio took its time, but Cobalt is finally available in its final version Weapons, infiltration, animals Cobalt's combat system is based on the alternation between hand-to-hand combat, the use of firearms and the throwing of mostly explosive objects. These functions are delegated to three different inputs that can be selected at any time based on the strategic needs of each level. As an alternative to the more traditional approach, which involves a head-on collision with the enemy, moreover with the considerable risk of dying very quickly, there are also two alternative solutions. The first consists in not being detected by the alarm systems widespread in many structures and eliminating the opponents without making any noise, while the second involves the use of slow motion to dodge the bullets, position yourself behind the enemy and complete the slaughter. With the right timing it is also possible to go towards the bullets or grenades that are coming in the direction of the protagonist and convert these resources to your advantage by returning them nicely to the sender. The mechanics proved to be interesting but in many situations less effective than they could have been. In fact, if with some weapons the operation is very simple and intuitive, when you are faced with rapid bursts, slowing down time can prove to be an unfortunate solution and reduce Cobalt to pieces in a matter of seconds. The arsenal that can be used during the adventure is noteworthy, in fact we are talking about almost forty medium and long range weapons and more than thirty different melee objects, but there are also defense shields and jet packs to easily reach places further away, since the canonical double jump doesn't offer a highly effective range. There are also copious drops left by killed enemies and the rewards that can be recovered within the scenarios, even if we have caught a tendency to imbalance resources in favor of throwing weapons and to the detriment of firearms. Another peculiarity of the game is linked to the control of some creatures present in certain segments of the path, fundamental from a tactical point of view and useful for overcoming situations that would otherwise be much more complex to untangle. Moreover, the taming criterion creates a few too many frustrations, requiring you to jump several times on the back of these animals until you dominate them. In many cases, a minimal error of judgment is enough to frustrate the enterprise and having to restart from the closest checkpoint, perhaps having to repeat even those segments that had already proved to be rather difficult to overcome. The feeling that Cobalt transmits on many occasions is in fact that of a product in which a lot of irons have been introduced but with a rather high learning curve and a tendency to be deliberately punitive, also due to a control system that does not much to meet the needs of the player. The problem emerges above all when you decide to play using the predefined keyboard commands, but the alternation between the three different approaches that we have just described creates some headacheseven with the pad. Nonetheless, the overall impression that emerges is that of an ambitious title, which tries to present itself with a characteristic identity in a world, that of 2D platformers, full of variations and fierce competitors. The shooter phases in fact represent only one side of the coin and are combined with the presence of multiple choice dialogues with some NPCs and the presence of some environmental puzzles. Arcade apotheosis The side where in our opinion Cobalt offers the best of itself is the Arcade section, made up of six multiplayer modes that can be experienced together with friends and the rest of the community within eighty specifically dedicated maps. First of all we have the canonical Deathmatch mode, combined with the Team Strike mode in which respawns are not foreseen. Plug Slam is the most particular category, providing that two opposing teams must recover a generator and then successfully insert it into the relative slot and thus forfeit the points necessary to win the match. Then there are the levels dedicated to survival, in which you have to resist eleven progressive waves of enemies taking care to upgrade your equipment round after round and finally the speed challenges, where you have to go through the levels in the shortest possible time. The frenzy of the arcade modes marries beautifully with the game mechanics and does justice to the deficiencies demonstrated by the control system during the main adventure. The criteria for enhancing and differentiating the character also seemed interesting, giving the opportunity to choose from even very different arsenals and to develop dynamics of differentiation of tasks within one's team. For example, it is possible to opt for a support class that makes use of medium-range weapons, prefer a character more equipped for melee combat, or decide to resort to long-range weapons, which will guarantee consistent damage but a frequency of fire very low. Furthermore, this setting has been structured in a flexible way and allows players, at the end of each single round, to always choose different or advanced equipment, also based on the progress of the game.", "date": "2016-02-05", "grade": "7.5"}
