Xcom, Grand Prix, Falcon: all titles made history. Among these the most important and long-lived was Civilization, Sid Meier's masterpiece of which we are eagerly awaiting the sixth incarnation. Using the same engine, the defunct Simtex created two variants of the most famous management ever: one set in a fantasy universe (Master of Magic), left without offspring, and the other set in the universe and nothing else, namely Master of Orion. The first two episodes were a huge success and represented real life experiences for many teenagers of the time, including Victor Kislyi, the founder of Wargaming.net. The World of Tanks company mogul acquired the intellectual property from Atari in 2013 to restore it to the glory it deserves: will he have succeeded? The answer is essentially affirmative, but not entirely: the reboot works, is engaging and has all the credentials to attract the attention of the public, but fails to be as overwhelming as the illustrious progeny. But how long, and still ... Starting the first game of Master Of Orion is like meeting an old friend after years: the physiognomy may have changed a little, but the sensations are the same as in 1993. Before starting, you need to set the parameters, selecting the dimensions of the universe, the number of opponents, the conditions for victory, possibly also varying details such as the maximum number of rounds (set by default to 500), any block in technological progress and so on. There are eleven races (for the deluxe version, which also includes the first three chapters, the soundtrack and the artbook, obviously in digital format) to choose from, all respectful of the progenitor's lesson. At the start of the game, the player has only the main planet. From here it is necessary to decide how to balance the workforce by dividing it between agriculture, production and research. The first serves to increase the population, the second to construct buildings and spaceships and the third progresses the skill tree. It should be noted that these characteristic traits apply to all races without distinction, including for example robotic ones that conceptually shouldn't need food. Naturally it is possible to delegate the task of choosing to the assistants, but at least in the initial stages it is strongly preferable to take the lead personally. The first units, just like in Civilization, will be those of reconnaissance, just to understand in which solar system we are; then the colonization ships will come. In this case you have to choose carefully which planet to dock on, because some may be unsuitable for cultivation but more suitable for production. In the meantime you will come into contact with the other players (up to a maximum of seven on a large map) and you will have to decide how to approach them, just like in Sid Meier's management. So it will be possible to make commercial alliances rather than close cultural exchanges, as well as obviously to wage war. In fact, the diplomatic part is one of the most successful aspects. A robust title that respects the dictates of the progenitor, but unable to introduce significant innovations Orion does not shine From the point of view of battles, the new Master of Orion turns out to be quite interesting, above all because they can be managed in first person by the player who can decide different strategies in detail: during the first skirmishes it could seem more like a stylistic exercise, but if you exploit can correctly vary the direction of the balance needle. Thumbs down for the rhythms of the game which can prove to be extremely diluted: it will not be absolutely uncommon to wait for numerous rounds in the hope that something will happen. This is also because the movements between one corner and another of the universe, especially in the initial stages when certain types of technology are not yet available, are very slow. Time is killing itself with microeconomics, keeping pollution levels under control and choosing which form of government is most suitable for the final victory: perhaps using some spies to speed up technological growth. Once again the similarities with Civilization are absolutely adherent even if Sid Meier's title manages to amaze with the wonders (absent here) and a development tree whose reflections are a little more appreciable even in the in-game phases. From the firepower of Wargaming there will beWe expected that the graphics sector, instead of aligning itself with the good but not excellent standards of the rest of the production, could amaze. Instead, it suffers from some annoying oversights, such as the low resolution of the FMV movies, and more generally a parsimony of polygons, especially noticeable in the spaceship showrooms, which leave a bitter taste in the mouth. Even the art direction didn't seem particularly inspired, since the models of the races seem to have been taken verbatim from Mass Effect and StarCraft: the original ones were much more intriguing. On the other hand, the dubbing is good and also the soundtrack which sees the return of some of the original artists. Unfortunately, among the many supported languages, ours is missing. Master of Orion is the progenitor of the 4X genre, a curious acronym which indicates the four main phases in a turn-based strategy game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate). Naturally this is not the first title based on these rules, but it was so indicated for the first time by colleague Alan Emrich in the review published in Computer Gaming World magazine. The same was then in charge of the third chapter of the series. This is the first and last game he worked on and, we might add, fortunately: history tells us that it was a failure across the board.", "date": "2016-09-05", "grade": "7.5"}
