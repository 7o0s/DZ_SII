{"name": "Kaze no Klonoa 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/kaze-no-klonoa-2.html", "text": "The main character is a kind of cat, which apparently seems to have two curious auricles that look like hands and allow our hero to glide for a short time. Come on, don't make those faces have any of you ever seen Disney's Dumbo? In any case, returning to us, it must be said that this Kaze no Klonoa 2 represents a rare example of how a notoriously trivial genre such as that of platformers can blend beautifully with the puzzle game genre. This is because in various situations you will find yourself having to make abstruse calculations to take advantage of the various types of enemies on the screen. In fact, the protagonist, using a particular tractor beam, can temporarily immobilize the most disparate creatures, using them later and with the right amount of timing, as a springboard or as a keystone for the solution of certain situations. To give you a practical example: at a certain point you will find yourself stuck in front of a blue ice wall and three Muu and a Ruwaru will appear in front of you, unsociable exponents of the bestiary present in this Kaze no Klonoa 2. In short, only after a few attempts you will discover that unlike the Muu, which can only be used as trampolines, the Ruwaru change color every time they are thrown against enemies, acquiring different colors including blue which will allow us to break through the wall of the same color ! This is a typical example of the intriguing situations that will alternate between one platform and another yes, because the guys from Namco absolutely did not want to sacrifice the typical elements of the genre, so after the first game levels you immediately notice the exceptional balance between reasoning and pure pinpoint jumping ability, required in most ~Super Mario oriented~ titles! Among other things, there are some hilarious and original situations, such as daring performances on an unmanageable snowboard and on a windsurf board chased by sharks. Each step is then skilfully followed by a series of very original shots which are always appreciable in all conditions. More often than not you will even be able to interact with elements in the background, such as when you will be called to throw an enemy towards the depth of the screen in order to hit a pendulum, which when hit in the right place allows the opening of a passage. However, the wonders of this title do not end there. Another of the elements created with great attention are the end-of-level bosses, whose movements must be studied with obsessive attention to discover their weak points and the types of attack and defense. So forget to shoot non-stop on everything that moves, you would be disintegrated in no time! Nothing to complain about the graphics either, which, although sparse in the elements of the landscape, immediately show a decidedly ~cartoonish~ inspiration and full of colors, the latter so bright as to really force the use of sunglasses. The ~cel-shading~ technique was then used for both the main character and the enemies who infest the various locations, the latest invention in the graphic field which gives the whole a ~comic artist sketch~ style effect. To make you understand better, it is the same effect used for example in Jet Set Radio for Dreamcast. Finally, the last compliments go to waste for the exceptional animations of our lop-eared cat, truly exceptional regardless of the distance of the shot. If this were not the case, some passages of absolute precision would have become really frustrating. In short, everything contributes to lowering the player into a kaleidoscopic world that you will soon seem to have always known, despite its difficulties and extravagant characters inspired by Japanese comics culture. The combination of the typical elements of the platform and those of puzzle games, then gives this title that added value that deserves the appellation of experience to try absolutely! Adriano Passamonti - Editor-in-chief of Xplaymagazine Thinking about it, every time a new console is launched on the market, it follows a successful platform in an almost mathematical way, this is because a large part of the user does not hide their desire to live the gaming experience in a carefree way and without any commitment. No adrenaline in the veins to tackle a tremendous parabolic curve, no brainy actions to find the way to the goal, no long wanderings to locatere the magical jewel, only jumps, little objects to collect and bright colors with which to amuse one's young retina! So here's where the magic lies behind every self-respecting platformer. If you then also discover that the game in question offers some interesting variations on the theme of ~jump on that platform to collect the bonus~, then your gaming experience begins to approach sensory perfection... As many of you will have already understood, every reference not it is purely coincidental, but it refers to Namco's latest effort, a very successful sequel to a platform that not everyone appreciated in its PlayStation version at the time.", "date": "2001-06-11", "grade": null}
