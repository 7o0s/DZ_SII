{"name": "Enter the Matrix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/enter-the-matrix_c.html", "text": "Little Hackers grow up Enter the Matrix (full console style) is full of special content to unlock. The original thing is the medium that makes this possible, i.e. the Hacking mode. It is basically a text mini-game in which you find yourself in front of a typical DOS Prompt (with commands almost identical to the original Microsoft) through which we have to explore a computer system, full of hidden or protected directories, reserved hard drives and so on, in which photos, sounds and videos related to the saga nestle. Definitely satisfying and fun, and a minimum of patience is enough to be rewarded with truly unmissable goodies for every fan. The Path of the Elect The gameplay of EtM is a successful blend of firefights and hand-to-hand combat that goes far beyond the action proposed by the usual Max Payne (once again an inevitable comparison). The weapons introduced are not the most original seen in circulation, but they are faithful to their cinematic counterparts and at the same time well differentiated from each other, so much so that it is difficult to identify one better than all the others, but you will often change them depending on the situation. It should be noted that the transportable ammunition is extremely scarce and after a minute of shooting you will find yourself having burned most of your arsenal, but it is in these situations that the martial arts talent of the protagonists enters the scene, perfectly capable of keeping head half a dozen battle-hardened Swats, whirling like human whirlwinds in a lethal (and mesmerizing) dance of death. Whether you decide to focus more on firearms rather than fists, Bullet Time will naturally have a decisive importance, because activating it not only allows us to see bullets and therefore dodge them, but allows us to perform all that series of stunts from Hong Kong cinemas that made the Matrix saga famous at the cinema and which we talked about abundantly in the preview some time ago. After testing the game thoroughly we can only confirm the initial impressions: although not unlimited, the different possible combinations of unarmed attacks, acrobatics and firearms are quite sufficient in number to guarantee a certain variety in the action and what is more matters, they ensure that there is never only one way to get past a particular clearing. Not only are we spoiled for choice on the method to use to shoot down enemies, it is also possible to evade most of the clashes with a wise use of our aerial capabilities, and by exploiting the conformation of the surrounding environment, we can create exciting escapes against all physical laws, jumping entire flights of stairs or projecting ourselves through doors and windows (pleasant deja-vu abound). It must be admitted that the artificial intelligence of the enemies is not very brilliant and whatever the level of difficulty, only their resistance to bullets seems to change, but it is not uncommon to see them engaged in interesting reactions, such as taking cover behind the columns to avoid our shots or diving from around corners to catch us by surprise. And speaking of the enemies, the battles with the bosses at the end of the level are literally epic, although they suffer from a certain repetitiveness due to the dozens and dozens of hits to be hit to knock them down. But after all, even in the two films, these kinds of comparisons continue for whole minutes. The presence of two selectable characters is commendable, which have not negligible differences in terms of gameply: Niobe boasts longer combos and superior acrobatic skills, while Ghost is a real sniper who doesn't miss a shot and also seems to shoot faster. Furthermore, the two approach the adventure from different points of view and although the story is ultimately the same and the levels are the same for both, they are overcome via different routes, so it is definitely worth replaying the adventure. Joypad Vs. Keyboard: The Eternal Struggle In the PC port phase, the Enter the Matrix control system has been revolutionized to adapt to the use of the mouse and keyboard, which remain the most widespread control devices on our beloved Windows platform. If at first glance the impression is that of a control system similar to that of the old Max Payne, the ramifications of EdM's gameplay soon tend to show a certain intolerance of the limitations that the use of the keyboard imposes on us in this case. Nothing that a proven gamercannot solve with a bit of healthy training to which years of 3D action have accustomed us, but some of the most acrobatic acrobatics require the equally acrobatic pressing of 3-4 keys with one hand, while the one used to control the mouse remains most of the time unused, given the massive intervention of the automatic aim. The opinion of the undersigned is that in this way the game loses much of the immediacy which is one of the strengths of the corresponding console version. Also a disconcerting fact: taking a joypad in hand, it is sufficient to push the analog stick at half power to make the characters ~walk~, but on PC, where pressing the ~forward~ button automatically corresponds to running, it seems to have been omitted by introduce a button to block the movement speed, as had happened - for example - in the porting of Splinter Cell. The fact in itself would not be a problem, were it not for the increased difficulty in seizing enemies from behind with the appropriate grips surprisingly (not particularly useful in truth) which by their very nature only work by silently approaching the poor guy on duty. Engine, engine of my desires... The least exciting aspect of EtM is undoubtedly the graphics, or rather the engine that moves it, decidedly not in step with the times, especially in this ~post E3~ climate, on the occasion of which we have seen plenty of technical marvels. Designed to adapt to the Ps2 hardware, the Enter the Matrix engine pays off in terms of spectacularity the limits of the no longer dazzling Sony platform (which has also shown us much better in recent years!). In fact, the game has a much better appeal on the latest generation consoles, with a general increase in definition and the disappearance of scan lines. On PC, the graphics improve further thanks to the remarkable resolutions supported and the use of anisotropic filtering for well-made textures (at least those of the characters, while the environments remain decidedly bare). The fact remains that the engine is a bit ~weak~ in terms of the number of polygons it is able to display and the management of dynamic shadows (sometimes inconsistent) and animations, decidedly oversized in terms of quality compared to the ability of the engine to integrate them with each other and prevent annoying ~dismemberment~ of the 3D models. By the way, remember to install the patch that you find in Area Files, the different graphics cards tend to react in different and nonetheless imaginative ways to the game's special effects, and an annoying bug related to sound causes a drastic drop in framerate even on computers- fiercest ninjas. Fortunately, the patch works very well, and although the engine is not exactly a featherweight, it is scalable enough to guarantee fun even on less performing machines. In any case, it is clear that Shiny have not lost sleep over creating a well-optimized port. Expressing a definitive judgment on Enter the Matrix is not easy, games that are victims of such clear contradictions rarely happen. Specifically we have an absolutely successful and fun gameplay, where most of the titles of this genre sin instead of monotony, but we also have a very unattractive technical realization even for those who know how to be satisfied. So, if you own any console, leave your PC off for once and buy it for that, you will have enough fun with it. Otherwise, it is time to ask yourself a few more questions. If you are a fan of the Matrix you could also overlook the technical flaws and the control system that is not exactly at the top of ergonomics, especially if you are attracted by the plot, which is actually the natural complement to that of the film, and covers many of the less clear points or little depth of the plot of the film. If, on the other hand, you don't have a particular reason to prefer Enter the Matrix to any other exponent of the same category (GTA Vice City, for example), be sure to try it before proceeding with the purchase. Pros: Robust and original gameplay Rarely thick storyline and characters Fun! Cons: Disappointing graphics In the long run repetitive Package to forget Sometimes they come back... The first sequel to the Matrix is out, and the video game has also hit the shelves by now. Yet it's not over yet, those who say that 2003 is the year of the Matrix are obviously right, with another film arriving in November and a promising MMORPG (branded Ubisoft this time) that will continue the plot after the end of the film trilogy. But who are the protagonists of this Enter the Matrix, a game that acts as a prelude to then intertwine with the complex plot of the second film installment of the Wachowsky brothers' saga? Niobe, Ghost and their operator Sparks are the small but fierce crew of the Logos, one of the ships of the Zion fleet, which also includes the Nebuchadnezzar of Morpheus and Neo. As proof of the fact that the outcome of great enterprises does not depend only on the actions of the most celebrated heroes, but also on the industrious collaboration of silent supporting actors, Enter the Matrix gives voice to characters who, little more than extras in The Matrix Reloaded, they undoubtedly deserve to have an adventure of their own.", "date": "2003-05-24", "grade": null}
