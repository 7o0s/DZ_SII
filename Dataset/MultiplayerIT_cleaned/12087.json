{"name": "Metal Slug Mobile 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metal-slug-mobile-3.html", "text": "If the name Metal Slug means nothing to you, you've probably lived on Mars for the past 10 years. Since its debut in the arcade and on Neo Geo, the SNK series has in fact garnered enormous success, establishing itself as one of the spearheads of the Japanese software house. After countless sequels and the passage on almost all the consoles on the market, Metal Slug starting from 2004 also arrived on mobile phones thanks to I-Play, to reach the third episode called Metal Slug Mobile 3 as easily suspect. programmers this time it was to remedy the serious longevity problems of the first two chapters, which could really be completed in an hour of play. In this case, however, the levels are 12, and although it doesn't take long to get to the final screen, the duration is still satisfactory and acceptable. The mechanics are instead anchored to the classic dictates of the series, without particular variations; the protagonist is Sergeant Allen, a muscular, shirtless hero called upon to single-handedly defeat the threat of an alien invasion. In reality, the story is just a mere justification to support the progression in the levels, where you will have to eliminate anything that moves using a whole series of more or less destructive weapons: rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, lasers and so on, without forgetting the grenades to be used sparingly. While underlining the indisputable progress compared to the previous two episodes, it must be said that the playability of this Metal Slug Mobile 3 is not yet fully comparable to the major series. In addition to a slight complexity in the event that you have to shoot up (keys 1 or 3) or down during jumps (key 8), a slightly slower pace of play should be noted, a slight delay when pressing the buttons and a lack of variety in the enemies present, which often repeat themselves continuously throughout the adventure. The sound is also rather weak, with no soundtrack and only a few effects to break the silence. Technically, however, the effort of I-Play is really pleasant, maintaining the style of the series even with a slightly more restricted view. The size of the protagonist compared to the screen can therefore cause some visibility problems, but in principle there is not much to complain about from this point of view. The different levels are also distinguished by the different environments, all well done, and by the well-implemented parallax. Too bad for the absence of any multiplayer mode that would undoubtedly have made the game even more fun. All in all, therefore, the work done by the programmers with Metal Slug Mobile 3 can be considered satisfactory, as further confirmation that the quality of the ~real~ Metal Slug is not that far away...
