This list also includes Beat Hazard Ultra: an ~enhanced~ version of the original Beat Hazard, already available on practically all digital platforms, the title developed by Cold Beam Games has landed a few days ago on the App Store to also allow iPhone owners and iPad to test its potential, all indistinctly linked to the starting concept mentioned a few lines ago, ie the ability to influence the action on the screen using music and, specifically, its intensity. When we launch Beat Hazard Ultra, the software scans the music tracks on the device (an operation whose duration obviously depends on the amount of songs we have) and then presents us with a start screen where we can choose which music to use and how to try our hand at four possible choices: Standard, Survival, Boss Rush and Chill Out. The side options are also numerous: you can play with a single virtual stick, with auto-fire, or with two ~twin analog shooter~ style sticks, make the same sticks repositionable or fixed and finally adjust the intensity of the video effects, which based on the ~strength~ of the piece of music produce very bright lights, which can be very annoying to the eye depending on of his own sensitivity. Once in the game, the gameplay is typical of the genre, therefore completely similar to the classic Geometry Wars, but with an important difference, namely the variety of events (from the number of enemies to their behavior) which directly depends on the progress of the selected music, and which therefore offers a different experience every time, which is never repeated. From this point of view it is clear that a repetitive song does not produce particular results, while a song that starts slowly but grows decisively in certain points translates into hostile waves capable of giving us a hard time. Follow the pace The role of music in Beat Hazard Ultra is therefore main, and the degree of intensity of the sound accompaniment determines in many ways the difficulty of the level, which ends together with the song. The idea works very well and is greatly supported by the light effects, the real protagonists of the Cold Beam Games product, capable of producing truly remarkable ~lightnings~ but which, as previously mentioned, can be very annoying to the eye based on to your degree of photosensitivity. Our ship moves around the screen, eliminates more or less large enemies and collects points and upgrades, then turns its weapons on more or less inspired ~bosses~, generally made up of various ~sections~ that must be destroyed one at a time. Given the ~random~ nature of the patterns and the action in general, unfortunately some fixed points of the twin analog shooter genre are missing, such as the taboo according to which, in general, an opponent does not materialize in the corner of the screen where we are. In Beat Hazard Ultra these things happen all too often, which, together with the enormous chaos that is created in certain situations, helps to make enemy fire or the arrival of a hostile ship against which we could crash undistinguishable. Fortunately, the amount of lives available effectively plays the role of ~buffer~ against the inevitable sudden deaths that occur for these reasons, together with the large number of upgrades that can be unlocked every time a stage is successfully completed (therefore extra lives , multipliers and so on). Solid, fun and varied, the game leaves you a little perplexed only for the graphics of the spaceships, perhaps a little too simple and basic compared to the overflowing spectacularity of the special effects.", "date": "2012-03-13", "grade": "8.4"}
