In short, the good Tiger probably won't have much time to mess around with his virtual version in this new Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, and we feel sorry for him, since it is the very welcome improvement of one of the best golf games in recent gaming history . Tiger against Tiger It is no coincidence that we use the term ~improvement~, given that the EA product is to all intents and purposes an upgrade of the previous version, with all that follows from it: and therefore if it is legitimate to turn up one's nose a little in the face of a technical realization substantially unchanged compared to last year and with the persistence of English as the only language on the menus, there are several improvements that will make fans of the genre happy. First of all, their glorious return of the mechanics that regulate the execution of the shots should be underlined, and which provide for assuming the classic golfer's posture, pointing the Remote downwards and swinging the arm with an inclination and a speed that are realistically reproduced from the on-screen alter ego: obviously the effect is maximized with the use of Motion Plus, which here proves to be even more useful than last year, detecting the movement performed with absolute precision, punishing the most approximate swings and rewarding those more ~professional~. The yield is truly excellent, and by setting the most realistic settings, the Motion Plus effectively detects not only the speed of the movements performed, but even the slightest inclinations of the Remote, translating them into different trajectories of the balls. It goes without saying that such a playful choice (underlined by the new Advanced Plus and Tour Pro difficulty levels) belongs exclusively to the most experienced users, given the very steep learning curve that characterizes it: for all the others, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 offers a vast series of parameters that can be modified to make the experience more immediate, with the final term of the All-Play option which effectively makes the game similar to Wii Sports golf and opens the door to simpler multiplayer use. As for the solo career, enthusiasts will really find a mountain of content to sink their teeth into, even if the immense depth of the advanced control system would be enough to guarantee enormous longevity to the EA product: unless the user is a golfer in real life too, being able to produce precise shots requires great practice and dedication, a process necessary to begin to have a minimum of competitiveness in the various tournaments. In this regard, five new courses have been added - bringing the total number to 28 - while the main menu also allows you to try your hand at the Ryder Cup, by registering for the European or US team. In terms of extra modes, the section dedicated to minigames can boast the nice introduction of minigolf, divided between four scenarios of nine holes each: nothing to tear your hair out about, but still a pleasant entertainment, especially if played in company. Matter of putts Still on the profile of the small but significant innovations of this Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, the so-called True View Camera should also be noted, which replaces the traditional third-person view with a subjective one: essentially, at the time of shooting, on the screen you see only the golfer's feet, the ball and the club that moves according to the movements made with the Remote. A feature on the card aimed at giving further realism to the experience (it is no coincidence that the game tutorial advises those who want to take advantage of it to place a real ball on the floor to have a better shooting feeling), but which ultimately does not work particularly well. In fact, it is difficult to understand exactly in which direction to aim when only a limited portion of turf is visible on the screen, an annoying aspect especially in the putt phase; the perspective also does not change once the shot is made, with the poor definition of the graphics made in Wii which really does not help to identify the path of the ball. And the technical implementation is the only big drawback recognizable in the EA title: let's be clear, graphically the game is absolutely not inferior to the average of the Wii soft library, but there were certainly some marginsini improvements in the past edition that have not been taken into consideration at all. Even the sound doesn't shine par excellence, and the spoken commentary (as always in English) is immediately boring.", "date": "2010-07-08", "grade": "8.5"}
