Things have changed from the lateral duels in bitmaps of the past and the three-dimensional turn has given birth to a decidedly new genre which among the advantages has the freshness of the gameplay and timing such as to leave room for tactics and reasoning again. We have already seen the structural potential and implications of the medieval genre with Mount & Blade, but Chivalry does not aim to tread the same path. As in War of the Roses, we are faced with a title exclusively devoted to multiplayer and devoid of strategic components, siege ladders and battle musicians. Furthermore, it does not even include horses, unlike War of the Roses, and the gameplay, however impactful and not at all easy to manage, gives up part of the simulation. In fact, the directional parries are replaced by the single parry, focused exclusively on timing, and this determines a more arcade style of play also strengthened by the stamina bar which is consumed by fighting and on which the possibility of parrying and attacking depend. However, the duel with a white weapon is well simulated, with the distance from the opponent remaining a key point, as in reality, to avoid the blows and to penetrate the opponent's guard with one's own weapon. Furthermore, the shield gives a considerable advantage and it is good never to forget football, the perfect weapon for pushing opponents and letting their guard down. The combat, in essence, is solid, with the parry being decidedly effective but requiring lightning-fast reflexes and paving the way for a devastating counterattack. The vital energy of the fighters, such as stamina, is linked to a bar, and also in this case the choice recalls a more arcade style than that seen in other similar products, but realism is guaranteed by the few blows needed to knock out an opponent . A title suspended between arcade and simulation Once the title has been loaded, we start with a well-finished and articulated tutorial that explains all the game situations in detail. The training phase is set in a military training camp and, through a series of scripted situations, presents us with the two factions at stake. The plot, however, ends in the motivations of those who defend with honor and those who attack with fury with the narrative component which is limited to contextualizing the colors and the screams of the two sides. Among the five modes currently available we find the classic deathmatch with different variations ranging from free for all to the clash between teams with only one life per player. But the main mode is undoubtedly the one that involves the conquest of various objectives that must be gradually destroyed. Advancement sometimes requires the use of siege weapons, and torching granaries and structures requires torches, which must be wielded and lit in the midst of the action. Not a small detail for a 17.99 euro title even if after a few games the action becomes automatic while such a detail would stand out much more in a real siege populated by hundreds of men. Obviously it's impossible to expect too much from an independent game sold at a budget price, not to mention that many titles funded by large publishers and certainly not with Kickstarter offer even less, but at the same time it's a shame to see good ideas marginally exploited. In any case Chivalry: Medieval Warfare compensates for some limitations imposed by the formula chosen by the developers with excellent graphics and a wide variety of situations and weapons with which to equip the four available classes. These are the armored knight, the ferocious vanguard soldier, the man-at-arms and the archer. Each weapon type has its own unique gameplay with the ax being heavier but also more massive and the two-handed greatsword capable of surprising you with rapid, long-range slashing. The deadliest weapons are inevitably those from range but the architectural richness of the maps allows the fighters to proceed almost always under cover. There is obviously no shortage of open areas, such as suspension bridges or canyons, which leave a dangerous window for snipers. The maps also hide further dangers such as precipices and fires ready to welcome us, for eternity, following a well-aimed kick. In essence, the balance appears good and it is always possible to stab or push an opponent distracted by the fury of battle into the abyss. In the most heated battles, the two-handed swordsman is more effective than the other melee fighters, but in the near futurethere will be balances and innovations that should allow the title to mature further. Medieval Unreal Engine 3 Aesthetics figure among the strengths of Chivalry: Medieval Warfare which, despite being a low-priced multiplayer title, takes full advantage of the Unreal Engine 3 offering us abyssal canyons, detailed maps full of hills, burning buildings and suggestive visuals with lots of ships that sail the seas and forests of fiery arrows that cross the sky. Added to this are convincing shadows, vivid colors and destructible objects. Unfortunately some textures lack definition and explosions and flames are not particularly exciting. In addition, the third-person view highlights some flaws in animations and collisions. But, even if it is possible to choose the view, the title has been designed to make the most of it in first person. Observing the battle from the eyes of our avatar, the animations are much more convincing, at least in relation to medieval simulations, with the attacks offering excellent visual and sound performance. Furthermore, the artistic sector can count on a nice English dubbing which is enhanced by the possibility of launching terrible war cries in the middle of the battle. But it is the outcome of the fighting that gives greater satisfaction with the killings that result in bloody situations with lots of heads severed from the neck and blood in quantity. Unfortunately the best way to enjoy these scenes is to die and in this case the visual satisfaction is inevitably dampened by the defeat. In any case, we can say that the guys at Torn Banner Studios have done a great job. The plot hinted in the tutorial contextualizes the games to objectives whose conquest is enhanced by flames, background battles, close combat, blood and screams. It is not surprising that this is the most popular mode given that the title was probably built around it. Despite this, the duel mode, which was introduced at launch, could be quite popular, given the importance of the player's skill which is recorded in detailed rankings.", "date": "2012-10-19", "grade": "8.2"}
