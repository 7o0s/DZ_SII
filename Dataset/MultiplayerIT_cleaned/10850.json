{"name": "Shellshock 2: Blood Trails - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shellshock-2-blood-trails-recensione.html", "text": "With the first Shellshock Guerrilla (those of Killzone 2) they tried to exploit the line of titles set in the Vietnam war. Despite the criticisms, the game was quite successful. The main problems were the excessive brevity and a certain banality in the gameplay, as well as the presence of controversial sequences in which the player was called upon to torture prisoners. Shellshock 2: Blood Trails was instead entrusted to Rebellion, the same ones who brought to our monitors, among others, the first great Alien vs Predator and the excellent, if somewhat snubbed, Sniper Elite. The plot puts us in the shoes of Nate Walker, an American soldier whose brother has been used for some strange experiments. Entrusted to a psychopathic fellow soldier, we will have to penetrate the Vietnamese forest where one of the most terrible secrets of the Vietnam War is hidden: the zombies, called, for the occasion, infected (the originality in power). The first sequences are all in the name of splatter and clarification of intent: despite the setting, we are faced with a horror game. There is no shortage of screams, blood everywhere, plays of light and shadows and so on. Overcoming a small festival of assorted horrors, with mutilated and deformed bodies, small war cruelties and some dramatic exaggeration on both sides, you will come to hold the first weapon of the game (a pistol) and take part in the first shootout , making very clear all those that in the first moments of the game were only impressions. Where are you aiming? The first thing you notice is the lack of care in the three-dimensional models and animations. With any Killzone 2 in your eyes, watching the awkward movements of these ill-proportioned puppets is quite impressive. But we will come back to the technical part later. We come to the first shooting. Grabbed the gun we mentioned above, we try to aim and we realize the terrible targeting system implemented. Strange, since it was made by the same people who created the excellent one of Sniper Elite. We specify that, to meet those who want to know the differences between the PC and console versions, we tried to play both with a joypad (the one for Xbox 360), and with the mouse and keyboard. In the second case, the situation improves, but the general difficulties remain, above all due to an unbalanced viewfinder acceleration system. The difficulties in aiming weren't enough, the damage system also complicates the player's life. Basically there are two types of damage: that to the body and that to the head. The second is the only one that involves the instant death of enemies (boss aside). Now, aiming for the head isn't easy, so most shots end up against the body, especially when using a joypad. Not bad, one might say, a pity that to shoot down an enemy by hitting the body you need to fire many shots. Holding a machine gun it could also pass, but why do you need to fire three shots to take down an enemy with the shotgun? Why is there no difference whether the shot is delivered at close range or from long range? Indeed, we noticed that for some mysterious reason, shooting at a distant enemy is easier to hit him in the head. Grenades are also buggy, in the sense that throwing one into a pile of enemies causes them to flinch slightly as they continue forward. It takes two to kill an enemy, even with a full blow. Ergo: grenades are completely useless, even in situations where it might seem otherwise. Variety 0 Enemies are of two types: Viet Cong and zombies, with the latter much more dangerous than the former. At the maximum difficulty level, dying facing the first ones is not an easy affair. Obviously facing them in the open field is counterproductive, but just place yourself behind cover and wait for them to go and put themselves in front of the viewfinder, to shoot them down without problems. The AI doesn't have any assault tactic other than: ~aim at the player head down, wherever he is~ and ~stay in position, even if the enemy approaches cheerfully with bazooka in hand~. For example, during the assault on a bridge, the Viets continue to move in an open field, without looking for cover, even if they are targeted with a machine gun, or, on many other occasions, they continue to attack with a battering ram, even with a mass of corpses of fellow soldiers piled up as a warning that appearing in that area can be counterproductive for health. It's different with zombies. Nobody expects them to have refined AI, otherwise what kind of zombies would they be? But it would be nice to see them more reactive when, trying to catch us, they get stuck against a post or coinside a wall. With both enemy types, the only challenging moments are when they attack en masse, although it's often more a matter of control system than actual difficulty (mouse and keyboard is certainly better). Indeed no, there are cases in which you can have great difficulties: when an infinite number of enemies appear from a point that has just been cleaned up and when you are attacked from behind by an enemy who has appeared out of nowhere. The first case is a classic that has also plagued important video games (for example the debut title of the Medal of Honor series on PC), the second case is less frequent and involves a certain amount of frustration: imagine that you have just passed a section of the level , exploring every inch, and feel a sudden blow from the shoulders; the first question that arises is: where did the enemy come from? The answer is hidden in the lines of code. Vertical collapse But it gets worse: the interactive film sequences. Someone considers them in general as the disguised return of laser games, but if implemented decently they are not too bad to break up the gameplay by adding a little show. In Shellshock 2 they have been implemented poorly. Every now and then you are attacked by some enemy or you run into a trap. The only way to save yourself is to press a sequence of keys shown on the screen. Now, pass the fight scenes that give you plenty of time to react and press the right keys (even if they could have avoided such sudden cuts), but the traps require lightning-fast reflexes and, often arriving unexpectedly (otherwise what traps would they be?), die at least once it is almost mathematical. Now, with an intelligent placement of the above, the problems would have been minor, but since someone has, for example, chosen to place an interactive sequence immediately after a boss, or has distributed traps in an open area that requires a minimum of exploration , the result is that we always face them with annoyance for fear of losing the progress made and having to repeat the obstacles overcome perhaps with some effort. As mentioned above, technically we are dealing with a poor title that seems to belong to the older generation of consoles: apart from the three-dimensional models, even the textures are often poorly defined and seem smeared over the scenery. The special effects are nothing special, with the most timid explosions seen in a video game for a few years now and with the effects of physics reduced to the bone and irrelevant in terms of gameplay. The representation of the jungle is saved, but the good general impression is lost when you realize that the levels are linear and that the vegetation is only an impenetrable scenography. Most of the time we continue along clearly visible tracks with enemies appearing in front of us, eager to get hit. Comment Shellshock 2 fails to offer anything good or innovative. It is a product that is finished in a few hours and is carried forward only for that minimal interest aroused by the plot, however trivial it may be. It is really difficult to find something to save, as it lacks imagination, frenzy and tactics. The only skill required of the player is to be able to tolerate the imprecision of the control system. Even if we must recognize that the most splatter moments give it a minimum of satisfaction. Pros The sound effects The vaguely horror atmosphere Against Annoying targeting system He gets bored very quickly Few levels, few enemies and few weapons.
