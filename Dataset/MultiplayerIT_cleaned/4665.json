While the whole world is, rightly, abuzz for that FighterZ which will launch Dragon Ball in the Olympus of competitive fighting games at the beginning of next year, Nintendo Switch owners can finally get their hands on the port of Dimps' latest effort. The last few weeks have seen a series of announcements regarding the arrival of third-party titles on the Nintendo flagship: if on the one hand Bethesda's choice to bring both Doom and the future Wolfenstein: The New Colossus to Switch, less surprisingly, the conversion of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 arrived. Namco Bandai's title is exactly what we got to play last October, but enhanced by the possibility of playing it where and when you want; in light of this it would seem like a must-buy for all fans of Goku and company, but it wouldn't be exactly correct to put it in these terms. Let's try to understand why together. Let's change the story, again The entire narrative arc inserted in Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is based on the idea that the saga, as we know it, will one day be altered through time travel. This would lead to the sudden modification of events already experienced by everyone, such as the death of Raditz and Goku at the hands of Piccolo. This premise serves as a pretext to give players the opportunity to enjoy some new twist in the Dragon Ball plot and, at the same time and much more importantly, the possibility of giving the player full freedom in creating his own character. Through a discreet editor and the presence of five races, we will be able to model the one or the one we will take on the role of. We will therefore be called to move from era to era as members of the time patrol, in order to interfere with the changes in history and bring everyone back to the right threads of destiny. Although certainly not exciting and also partially taken from the previous first chapter of Xenoverse, the narrative arc written by the developers is pleasant, also thanks to some exquisitely crafted animated scenes. Certainly don't expect introspection and depth of dialogues, but we are still talking about Dragon Ball and Bandai Namco knows well that the important thing is the blows. On a completely different level, and far worse, are the secondary missions: if it is true that Dimps has tried to insert as many situations and subplots as possible, there is probably not a single occasion in which one finds himself eager to return to yet another dragon ball retrieval mission on Namek. Xenoverse 2 is therefore a mammoth title in terms of hours of gameplay, but if you are looking for a good story about Dragon Ball, go back to what has kept us glued to televisions for years. Fighting-RPG There are those who have gone so far as to define Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 as the (almost) definitive experience in the world of Akira Toriyama. The structure put together by the Japanese team is actually interesting and boundless, without betraying the desire of the fans to be able to play with an incredible roster of characters. That's why the idea of combining the well-tested 3D fighting game system on Dragon Ball, with a role-playing game, has allowed us to experience a freedom of customization that is actually fascinating for a good dose of hours. The central HUB, Conton City, is several times larger than the one in the first chapter and has an exorbitant amount of activity inside. Between small recovery missions and very long series of lessons given by Kuririn and his associates, it will be difficult to run out of things to do. The main problem in this system, however, comes from the excruciating repetitiveness of a combat system that risks getting boring after a few dozen clashes with the CPU. Each fight, the real fulcrum of the action, otherwise set aside in favor of exploration and dialogue, will last for a handful of minutes during which the combos will inexorably chain together, with extreme difficulty for the opponent to respond to our blows. The possibility of inserting simple key combinations for the use of the most powerful attacks is certainly useful for managing the infinite number of skills that can be equipped; but inexorably makes the gameplay during the clashes cumbersome and not very varied. It's a great shame because all the world set up by Dimps, made up of shops, non-player characters, avatar growth and related characteristics, as well as learning new techniques through lessons and customizing your alter's clothingego, it's a world that we like and that deserves a much more accurate general implementation. It would be extremely interesting to see a talented Western team and respectful of the series, working on a title of this genre. Where Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 amazes and calls to mind all our youthful fantasies, it fails to put them into practice, creating a mediocre fighting game that fails to approach such a bold, as only partially successful setting. The clashes with the other players are obviously of a completely different kind: the repetitiveness and lack of technique of the gameplay are partially obviated by the absence of artificial intelligence, thus leaving room for epic and over the top clashes, which make you soon forget the lack of depth of pure gameplay. But how's it going on Switch? It was only fair to give a fresh smattering of the title for anyone who didn't get to try it out about a year ago. But what really interests us is how the game behaves in its version for the Nintendo hybrid: if everything we have written so far was easily found by the players, the technical flaws of the title are its real scourge. The city that forms the backdrop to the title, although it was not sparkling in terms of performance even in its first edition, hardly manages to maintain the 30 frames per second, sometimes collapsing, to the point of making the title look like a splendid cinematic slow motion . Fortunately, this problem does not occur in battles, and it certainly is no small detail, but it takes a moment to realize the technical compromises necessary to run this title on Nintendo hardware. Alongside the resolutions of 720p on the laptop and 900p in the docked version, it is aliasing that visually devastates the Namco Bandai title. Problem now established for this new Nintendo machine, this graphical limitation makes the porting really difficult to digest, especially when you find yourself watching the title via a monitor. The goodness of the Nintendo Switch screen and the knowledge that you're playing a main Dragon Ball in the palm of your hand somehow fills the gap. However, it is impossible not to notice a drop in performance which makes it difficult to recommend a purchase for those who already own the original version. The only peculiarity that could make everyone waver, especially the most avid, is the possibility of using a new set of commands (trivially called ~movement~) that will allow you to use the JoyCon as if they were the real fists of your avatar and perform specific movements to perform some particular moves. It would be stupid to say that we haven't always dreamed of launching an energy wave in first person: Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, in its Switch version, also allows you this and we know that for many it could even be worth the price of the second round. However, know that you will not be faced with a martial arts lesson and do not think you will find dozens and dozens of movements faithfully reproduced. It all boils down to a series of short movement sequences and nothing more, sometimes erroneously perceived by the console's sensors.", "date": "2017-09-20", "grade": "7.5"}
