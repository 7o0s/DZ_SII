{"name": "Justice League Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/justice-league-heroes.html", "text": "Justice League Legends The game does not show off particular modes, therefore after the obligatory animated introduction, which lays the foundations of the story that will be told, Justice League Heroes simply allows you to start a new game, choosing whether to do it alone or with a partner in a multiplayer cooperative. This choice does not affect the progress of the action, as there will still be two Justice League characters on the screen at the same time and there will be the same number of enemies, but in single player you can switch from one hero to another at any time, depending on as needed; or you can have a human player take over, without any problems and at any stage of the game. If you've tried X-Men Legends, the setting of Justice League Heroes will be very, very familiar: the game uses a very similar interface for the use of superpowers, moreover it presents the same graphic setting: limited visible area, with the view that can be rotated at will using the right analog stick and a map that is displayed by pressing the same stick on its own axis. The characters move and the scenario flows accordingly, indeed showing a great quality of models and textures, as well as a certain level of interactivity: the heroes with super strength can lift cars, vans and other heavy objects to use them as weapons against enemies , while the various Batman, Zatanna, Flash etc. at most, they will be able to load a dumpster or pull out the rod of a road sign. But who are the characters that we will find ourselves controlling? Well, let's go in order... The heroes The Justice League is a historical supergroup, formed by the most famous and powerful DC Comics superheroes. In the game, the basic lineup consists of Superman, Batman, Marthian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, Zatanna, The Flash, and Green Lantern. On the bench, ready to be unlocked by spending the collected shields, there are also Green Arrow, Hawk Girl, two different Green Lanterns (including the original one, Hal Jordan), Aquaman and Huntress: they can only be used in stages that include choice of characters, though. Each superhero has unique characteristics, the analysis and enhancement of which forms the RPG element of the game. In this view, Batman starts from one level of strength and endurance, Superman from another, and so on. Each one has basic attacks at his disposal, namely a quick and a slow but powerful blow, the ability to jump and fly (or glide for a few meters, depending on the hero) and an action key that allows him to activate devices and collect items . The combat system is basically based on combos, and it is possible to parry blows by pressing one of the back buttons, with a different effect from character to character. Finally, another back key is responsible for activating superpowers: a small interface appears that assigns special strokes to the main keys of the pad, up to five. Taking Superman as an example, you can use thermal vision, freezing breath, a powerful uppercut, a charge and a ~solar boost~ (the character becomes stronger and more resistant). Batman, for his part, can use the various batarangs, the grappling hook in different ways and call his own bats to hit an enemy. These superpowers reveal a deep knowledge of the characters and their history, after all Justice League Heroes is built on a plot written by a well-known name in the comics industry, Dwayne McDuffie. Powers and superpowers We have said what the characters we will be able to control are capable of doing. Now, how do powers and superpowers work in the game? Each hero has a health bar and an energy bar, the latter being the one emptied by using superpowers. But describing the process in this way seems simplistic, because the developers of the Snowblind team have implemented a truly articulated and particular upgrade system, which allows us to correct any deficiencies of each hero using the points earned by fighting. At each ~level-up~, in fact, the characters receive a point as a gift, which can be spent to enhance one of their basic abilities or the effectiveness of superpowers. Thus, it is possible to improve the fighting capacity of a hero, increase the level of his health or energy, improve his powers or unlock those that are not yet available. To all this is added a further variable, represented by the power-ups that are collected in the stages and which can favor each of these items in terms of damage, duration, speed and luck. Power-ups that can also be ~mixed~ to get something better... The game Scanned din the presence of numerous animated sequences, the story of Justice League Heroes sees the most powerful DC heroes face a very serious threat, which initially manifests itself through the madness of numerous working androids, who begin to attack people, and then through the appearance of beings derived from insects, who manage to control the mind of those they sting. Soon, Batman and the others will discover that behind all this is hidden the actions of Braniac, a cyborg with uncommon knowledge and experience and with intentions of conquest. But who is behind him? What force is hidden within the meteorite fragment collected by the evil android? To find out we will take the field, as mentioned two at a time, and we will make our way through many enemies, which vary according to the stage. The characters that we will find ourselves controlling are, in most cases, predetermined: only on some occasions will we be able to select them, to form teams with particular objectives. The game is all action and entertainment, with no dead end until the end (a level where you'll want to take a pen and paper to mark which passage leads where), and includes a boss fight at the end of each stage. The difficulty can be misleading: at the beginning we almost avoid parrying the blows, preferring a direct approach to the fight, but already in the middle of the game we will have to collide with too many enemies for it to be possible to ignore their attacks, therefore we will often take advantage of the regenerative capacities of each character and then move on to the next wave. Technical realization The graphics of Justice League Heroes is excellent: the polygonal models of the characters are really well done and adherent to the original versions, with good animations and some touches of class (see the fluttering of the capes, really nice). It is possible to zoom in or out (there are three available) to see them better, and perhaps to appreciate the definition of the textures used, quite rare on PS2. Even the locations are well done, albeit with ups and downs (urban settings are better than extradimensional ones, for sure), and the level of interactivity is quite high, with an excellent representation of both the objects that can be grasped (the heroes equipped with superstrength they can lift even cars and vans in an instant, which become semi-transparent so as not to obstruct the view) and enemies, which in some cases can lose pieces before exploding. The thing that amazes the most, however, is the fluidity with which everything moves, really excellent. On the other hand, the graphics engine sometimes struggles and slowdowns occur, which do not affect playability but which obviously end up tarnishing an otherwise extraordinary aspect. The sound sector also defends itself very well and, ultimately, lives up to the graphics for pros and cons: the music is really very beautiful and engaging, the effects offer sufficient realism (with some exceptions) and the game is fully dubbed in Italian. It is a dubbing of not excellent workmanship, but which represents a welcome extra and should absolutely not be despised. The translation, in general, is of an excellent standard. Comment If you like DC Comics superheroes, you must not miss Justice League Heroes. It is a product that ~does only one thing, but does it well~, in the sense that it boasts only one game mode (enriched by a cooperative multiplayer that shouldn't be underestimated, on the contrary) and is focused on the arcade action in an unscrupulous way, but which underneath is full of facets in the form of upgrades and unlockable extras (alternative characters and costumes). The story is exciting, many characters from the DC universe appear and the technical realization is almost impeccable... consider one more point for the overall vote, in this case. If, on the other hand, you don't know the characters in the game, you may have big problems appreciating their merits and a more critical eye towards their limitations and flaws. Pros: Excellent technical realization Great thickness for power-ups and extras Cooperative multiplayer Cons: Some uncertainty of the graphics engine Only one game mode If you don't know the characters, it loses charm Marvel superheroes have long since gained greater popularity than their DC Comics counterparts. With the exception of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, in fact, it is rare that people in the street recognize Flash, Green Lantern, Marthian Manhunter and so on, respectable characters with a great tradition behind them, but who cannot boast the notoriety of Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hulk, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men and the list is really long. Surely the films produced in recent years have a cresponsibility in this regard, and the situation is also reflected in the video game market. Justice League Heroes, therefore, aims to remedy the excessive power that Marvel also holds in the field of tie-ins. Will he succeed?", "date": "2007-01-15", "grade": null}
