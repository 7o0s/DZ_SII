It's about having to advance from one location to the next by solving one puzzle after another in increasing order of difficulty, with the soul at peace and the mind alert, while the action is totally absent. In this case more than ever, since the screens are displayed in first person, with the mouse cursor flowing freely in the 360 three-dimensional space, changing shape in the key points on which it is possible to act. These vary from advancing towards an adjacent area to using an object on the ground, which we can combine with others already archived in the backpack, or put aside waiting for the oboro monkey expression to pass us and some idea. The game is all here, but in its simplicity it hides the passion for solving logical and decidedly challenging puzzles, where the only frustration is to ~get stuck~, something that no modern player now takes into account, but which here can very well happen, even if a bit of healthy reflection is enough to overcome each puzzle (no monkey tail to use as a crank...). in its simplicity it hides the passion for solving logical and decidedly challenging puzzles Arok the Riddler A big help comes from the precision with which the cursor identifies the interactable areas, which thanks to the technical progress of 3D graphics are always inserted in a clear and finely detailed context, so that the eye does not have to struggle to see a stick in the middle to a slush of pixels. Even if it is not part of the baggage necessary to be able to advance during the adventure, the presence of the Encyclopedia still deserves to be underlined, which is updated during our journey with many insights into prehistory and cave paintings. It adds nothing to the actual game that's for sure, but it's full of curiosities about numerous easy-to-access insights and in tune with the archaeological atmosphere of the title. The cave that is not there The premises are good and it is a product packaged with commitment but despite this Secret of The Lost Cavern is lost precisely in the narrative, which should on the contrary be the backbone of the game. In fact, we note the beautiful sequences in computer graphics that make us aware of the background, but everything ends much earlier than necessary, leaving us if not with a bitter taste, certainly with the need to know more, even if it is of a need destined to remain evidently frustrated. Furthermore, five characters are few and do not guarantee a large social universe full of dialogues which is the backbone of every self-respecting point and click. Fortunately, the numerous videos and splendid screenshots, designed to balance aesthetic needs with the practical need to distinguish details well, are a point in favor of the developers, who perhaps lose a little polish on the not always appropriate and sometimes intrusive music. Fortunately, the audio sector recovers with the dialogues, lacking in terms of emphasis but localized in Italian. It is therefore a simple game in its pretensions and far from the glories of modern video games, which hides a certain underlying weakness well in the graphic design, made evident by the short story gnawed by numerous puzzles, too little suitable for a casual audience. To judge The Secret of The Lost Cavern one cannot ignore the difficulty of the puzzles, which do not allow for a soft and gradual approach, seriously risking to torment the less experienced with sleepless hours. Beyond this, the story is too superficial and one realizes that compared to the hours spent weaving twigs and powders for painting, the final gratification is rather scarce. However, it remains a technically satisfying title, full of pleasant screens to look at and interspersed with numerous videos. Unfortunately, it pays the price of belonging to a very dated genre that focuses more on those looking for relaxing and stimulating entertainment, without too many emotions but pleasant. But be prepared for a long series of mental traps where relief for a solved puzzle is followed by anxiety for the next one, even if you can always peek at the solution that Multiplayer.it will publish shortly... Pros:  Graphically sharp and clean  Pleasant and relaxing  Challenging puzzles are challenging Cons:  but could turn into a nightmare  Dated approach to gameplay  Too short The finger is minebrush The Secret of The Lost Cavern is one of those titles that can be easily labeled, since they are ~pure~ children of a long tradition which in the case in question is that of adventures, often given for death but in reality always present. What better era then than prehistory, when the world was populated by monkeys who posed as men, even if the developers put us in the shoes of a boy who only has clothing that is primitive. In fact, Arok, the protagonist of our long journey, is an ordinary boy who relies on a mentor to develop the gift of cave painting, until the day his master mysteriously disappears. It leaves us alone this is true, but with a revelation concerning the existence of a mysterious cave where true knowledge seems to be hidden. This was understandable, certainly there was no Metal Gear in the cave, but there is still a secret that Arok has to discover and which concerns his unique ability to animate graffiti and draw important lessons from it. How this is possible is a matter of spirits and karma that we are not given to delve into. But now that the master has disappeared we have to fill up with graphite and look for untouched caves to deface, to follow in his footsteps up to the fate that awaits us.", "date": "2005-07-26", "grade": null}
