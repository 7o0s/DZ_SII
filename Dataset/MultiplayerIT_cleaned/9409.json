However, it does so thanks to a series of improvements, small and large: the inclusion in all editions (see box) of the DLC ~The Disappearance of Da Vinci~, its extra content for multiplayer modes and the free Abstergo Project Update 1.0 and 2.0; better graphics by definition, frame rate and lighting system; some additions to the dynamics that regulate the city's economy, in this case the possibility of investing money in the commercial activities that we have restored and which can therefore make us earn money based on their turnover. The plot of the game takes place mostly in Rome in the 1500s, with some visits to other famous Italian cities and some sections set in modern-day Monteriggioni (whose appearance has been modified to match the story told in Assassin's Creed II, of course - don't expect to visit it and really find Villa Auditore there). The first stages of the plot are known to a bit, since they were part of the demos shown before the game was released: after the confrontation in the Vatican with Rodrigo Borgia, born Pope Alexander VI, Ezio returns to Monteriggioni with his uncle Mario , embraces his mother and sister again and also finds Caterina Sforza waiting for him. After a night of passion, however, the awakening is bitter: the troops led by Cesare Borgia have approached the city at night, to carry out a terrible offensive at dawn. Awakened by the cannon fire, Ezio rushes out, reaches the walls and fires the cannons to eliminate at least the gravest dangers to his fellow citizens, then engages in furious hand-to-hand combat with the enemy soldiers who have now broken through. However, when Cesare Borgia shows him that he has come into possession of the Apple of Eden, Ezio is wounded by a rifle shot and can only flee through the dungeons. Having secured his mother and sister, he heads to Rome to take his revenge and end the fight once and for all. The marvelous city that stands out before his eyes lives under the yoke of the pontiff's family and his minions: anyone who dares to raise his head ends up being severely punished, even the artisans' shops are closed in the area of influence of the towers of the Borgia. A single assassin could never bear the weight of such a revolution, so the idea was born of recruiting some willing citizens, driven by a strong desire for revenge, to form a real order of assassins, capable of operating not only in Rome but also in the rest of Europe. This is precisely one of the most interesting innovations introduced by Assassin's Creed Brotherhood: from a certain point in history, we are given the opportunity to save people who have rebelled against the guards, to then hire them and transform them into real assassins. Each of these adepts can later come to our aid, eliminating enemies in our place, or be sent around the world to carry out missions of varying degrees of difficulty. Both the ~live~ support actions and the completion of the missions produce an increase in experience for our ~colleagues~, who can therefore be upgraded and whose appearance can be customized, up to the achievement of the rank of assassin complete with initiation ceremony. The possibility of recalling our brothers works through indicators that increase in number depending on the available followers: when there is a certain amount of them, we can even order them to shoot a shower of arrows against a group of targets, thus eliminating them in a few moments and without lifting a finger. Compare versions The PC version of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is available in three different editions: Standard Edition, containing the game, Abstergo Project Updates 1.0 and 2.0, and the additional content ~The Disappearance of Da Vinci~; Codex Edition, a limited edition characterized by a casket similar to the ones Ezio finds around the city, which contains the game, the Abstergo Project Updates 1.0 and 2.0, the additional content ~The Disappearance of Da Vinci~, the Codex of Altair (a 60-page book that reveals the history of the Assassins, complete with preparatory drawings for the game), a map of the city of Rome, a set of trading cards with characters from the multiplayer modes, the DVD ~Assassin's Creed Lineage~, a bonus dvd (with the original soundtrack, image galleries and more) and finally a series of unlockable contents (two characters for the multiplayer, two exclusive maps for the single player campaign and the ~Drachen~ armor for Ezio); Digital Deluxe Edition, the digital edition of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood which contains the game, Abstergo Project Updates 1.0 and 2.0, the additional content ~The Disappearance of Da Vinci~, the short film ~Assassin's Creed Lineage~, the original soundtrack of the game, image galleries, the making-of and a series of exclusive unlockable contents (two characters for the multiplayer, two exclusive maps for the single player campaign and the ~Drachen~ armor for Ezio). The Eternal City Recruiting new assassins is just one of the many things you can do in the Rome depicted in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. Unlike the second episode of the series, however, this time it won't be enough to climb any observation point to reveal the map and its contents. First we will have to deal with the Borgia towers, each manned by a handful of guards as well as by a captain with a different character from time to time: some will flee when we arrive and we will have to chase and catch them, others will challenge us to a duel, still others will remain firm riding his horse and we will have to be able to pull them before they are able to distance us. Failing to eliminate a captain means having to wait for another to take his place, making it impossible to destroy the tower in the meantime. If, on the other hand, our assault is successful (and using weapons such as the ~pistol~, the crossbow or the throwing knives, it often turns out to be very simple), once the soldiers remaining to defend the outpost have been routed, we will be able to dedicate ourselves to scaling the tower to then start a sequence in which Ezio sets fire to some explosive charges and finally launches himself into the void, landing in the classic wagon full of straw or flowers. Having swept away the symbol of the Borgias' influence in the area, we will be able to dedicate ourselves to the restoration of the commercial activities present in the surroundings: blacksmiths, tailors, painters, doctors, bank branches and stables which will allow us respectively to repair and upgrade our equipment (weapons, armor , ammunition), color our clothes and obtain larger bags, buy paintings or maps, treat our wounds and stock up on medicines or poison, withdraw the money accrued from the shops that we have reopened (and from investments in them, a small novelty of the PC version) and finally equip ourselves with a horse to more quickly cover the distances that separate us from our next objectives. As stated by the Ubisoft developers themselves, Rome is the largest city ever to appear in an episode of the Assassin's Creed series, and sometimes moving from point A to point B may not be a very fast operation. In addition to the horses, therefore, we will be able to use underground passages (even those to be restored) which will immediately transfer us to the desired area. Inside the city it is still possible to find treasures, feathers and flags, however in this case we will be able to discover their position thanks to the maps and not grope around or resign ourselves to consulting an internet guide. Various objects have also been introduced: fabrics, jewels, coins and anything else that we can resell at any craftsman, but which we would do well instead to keep in order to access the so-called ~merchant missions~ later. The fights, cross and delight From the outset, the Assassin's Creed series has used a combat system that is in many ways realistic and plausible, in others inevitably heralding a lowering of the level of challenge. Ezio has an enviable arsenal, which allows him to strike from a distance or up close, and this ultimately helps to make the character almost unbeatable. The introduction of ~combo~ killings in this third chapter, then, makes the clashes even faster and simpler to complete: even in the presence of difficult opponents, such as armored soldiers, you just need to score a countermove and then spear enemies left and right. This is undoubtedly a limit for the Ubisoft franchise, which is difficult to circumvent, which ends up framing the fights as a secondary element of the experience. What would Brotherhood have been like with a higher level of challenge? The Apple of Eden As mentioned above, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood sees Ezio Auditore intent on recovering the Apple of Eden that was stolen from him by Cesare Borgia, while trying to eliminate Cesare himself and his father Rodrigo. The missions that involve an advancement of the plot are those indicated on the ~radar~ by an exclamation point: exactly as in the second episode of the series, ci can concentrate only on those, completing the adventure in a reasonably short time, or devote himself to completing all the objectives that appear on the map, an undertaking that will require several dozen hours. Needless to say, we warmly suggest the second approach, truly capable of making you enjoy the experience in its entirety, explore the splendid Rome far and wide and also learn a little history, given that most of the characters involved in the story are actually existed and the integrated database will allow you to at least find out something about their life. The same goes for each of the many monuments in the city, also present in the database and initially in need of restoration which, in certain cases, will allow you to access otherwise inaccessible areas. One of the problems of the first Assassin's Creed, or the repetitiveness of the gameplay, was resolved with the second chapter and in Brotherhood now appears a distant memory, given that there are numerous types of missions: in addition to the aforementioned Borgia towers and the management of our brothers, we will in fact find ourselves assassinating single targets in a more or less silent way, tailing important personalities, facing even rather long stealth sessions, recovering documents, escorting allies in difficulty, contributing to victory in group battles and more. An interesting subplot will also lead us to explore the subsoil of Rome, solving complex sequences of jumps and climbs in the Prince of Persia style. The percentage of completion of the game, previously dependent only on the number of unlocked achievements (also present on PC via Ubisoft's Uplay service), now sees the presence of conditions necessary to obtain complete synchronicity between Desmond and his ancestor: sometimes there will be asked to complete the mission without losing energy, sometimes to have the target assassinated by our brothers. Finally we also find the glyphs, with the enigmas of Subject 16 often similar in structure to those seen in ACII, always full of curious quotations and historical photographs. What will his clues hide this time? The multiplayer modes There are six (plus two variants) multiplayer modes in the game: Wanted, in which each player is assigned assassination contracts, and the goal is to locate the target among the crowd and eliminate him before time runs out arrangement for each commission; Manhunt, where one team takes turns finding and eliminating the other; Alliance, a variant of the first mode in which three pairs of players compete against each other; Chest Hunt, a territorial mode in which two teams must conquer and maintain control of certain areas of the map; Escort, in which one team must take turns escorting two characters and the other must try to eliminate them; Assassination, also similar to Wanted, in which the goal is to find one's victim without being identified by a Templar assailant. Between unlockable and purchasable characters, there are twenty-one ~skins~ available for multiplayer modes. Choosing one or the other has only an aesthetic value, while the discourse of experience points and extra abilities that allow you to unlock is different: by advancing in level, we will be able to enrich our repertoire of very useful moves, able to provide us with a substantial advantage over the opponents and to significantly increase the thickness of an otherwise quite limited experience. The available maps, while not interactable like those present in the single player campaign (in order not to favor ~camping~, more than anything else), are all splendid: we will be able to face our battles between the Templars on the streets of Rome, Venice, Florence, Forl, San Donato, Siena, Pienza, Monteriggioni, Castel Gandolfo, Alhambra and Mont Saint-Michel. The extension of the locations appears more than sufficient for online matches: the scenarios lend themselves both to the ~silent~ phases and to the chases without quarter that punctually occur when our intended victim manages to identify us prematurely. Technical realization Since the first chapter, Assassin's Creed has been able to convincingly render not only the splendid architecture of the ancient cities (Acre, Damascus and Jerusalem first; Florence, Monteriggioni, San Gimignano and Forl then), but also and above all the ~life~ in inside these places, with the inhabitants strolling and arguing, the beggars begging, the minstrels who insist on playing a song, the snotty nobles and the ~proletarians~ who instead complain about social inequalities .
