{"name": "Umbrella Corps: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/170551-umbrella-corps-pioggia-a-catinelle.html", "text": "Capcom has tried several times to focus on Resident Evil's shooter mechanics to create new experiences, trying in practice to emphasize what was good in the Mercenaries mode of the classic episodes of the series. However, where the experiment made with Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City had given moderate results, the new journey of the Osaka house in the territory of the third person shooter proved to be a real disaster. Umbrella Corps immediately renounces to carve out a space in the tangled plot of the franchise, putting us in the shoes of anonymous mercenaries in the pay of the evil corporation who, for one reason or another, decide to face each other by dividing into two teams of three elements each, all is inside seven small maps inspired by some of the most famous scenarios of the series: the laboratories of Umbrella, the streets of Raccoon City, the Spanish village of Resident Evil 4 and so on. To surround the matches, literally, we find hordes of unusually tame zombies, which in theory should have represented an element of variation of the gameplay, and which instead limit themselves to moving and attacking players only in certain situations. Umbrella Corps is a poor title, which fails to value its kinship with Resident Evil Alone... The Umbrella Corps main menu allows you to access online modes, try a short tutorial to familiarize yourself with the controls, or take on a single-player mission sequence called ~The Experiment~. Let's start with the latter: these are very short stages, in which our character is often equipped in an essential way (at first he only wields the service pistol) and simply has the task of eliminating a certain number of zombies and collecting their DNA, eventually marking the time spent in favor of the leaderboard. Proceeding things get a little more complex, with devices to find and activate on the map, a greater quantity of accessible weapons and more numerous and reactive enemies, but in principle we are talking about a mode completely devoid of bite, put there probably to somehow increase an offer which, compared to a sale price of 29.99 euros, had been considered by the publisher to be too small. Not wrongly. The point is that facing the zombies in The Experiment has nothing to do with the experience of the classic Resident Evil, nor of the more action-oriented recent episodes, given that the artificial intelligence of the opponents leaves much to be desired (even for zombies, yes) and there is a disturbing background static. The presence of the same scenarios of the multiplayer modes also demonstrates how the entire single player sector was created quickly and with very few resources, returning a dull and banal experience, which will not fail to bore you after a few missions. ...or badly accompanied Moving on to the online modes, net of some initial connection problems and a rather slow matchmaking (surely the fault of the few online users, a factor which in our opinion could push Capcom to quickly fall back on free-to-play to save what can be saved ), the situation unfortunately does not improve in terms of design and production value. There are two options available: Extermination, a strategy-oriented team deathmatch with no respawns until the end of each round, and Multi-Mission, which includes a cycle of variants capable of ensuring more frenetic action. The Unity Engine used for the game once again shows all its limits, especially on consoles, but the lack of fluidity is only one of Umbrella Corps' problems. The interface, a little too vague and cumbersome, reveals the ambitions of the game in terms of progression, with new customizations that are unlocked only by reaching certain levels of experience, and likewise the possibility of adding accessories to weapons to improve their effectiveness, whether it be sights or grips capable of increasing shooting accuracy. It must be said that the gunplay performance is not bad: there is a good feeling and it is pleasant to open fire, whether it is pistols, light machine guns or shotguns. In the same way, the detection of the hits causes different reactions on the body of the enemies, with the inevitable headshots that alternate with crippling or other impairments, a pity that the management of the movement of the zombies on the ground often shows polygonal interpenetrations and other defects visuals. In short, it shoots well, but everything else is problematic: the third-person view is too close, with the result that the character covers an excessive portion of the screen, leaving angles completelyblind, while the movement is unnaturally ~fluid~, with evident lack of balance as regards the movements from crouched, which are as fast as normal walking. Then there is the question of the Brainer, a sort of scythe that each character has in their arsenal and which can be electrically charged, allowing you to eliminate your opponents with a single blow. When the participants in a game understand that using it can give them an easy victory, you will see them attack only in this way, hooking you even from a good distance and without you being able to effectively defend yourself from their maneuver. Playstation 4 trophies Umbrella Corps includes forty-one Trophies, including the Platinum one. To unlock them, you must mainly proceed in the online modes, winning matches, reaching high levels of experience, obtaining new equipment and distinguishing yourself in performance compared to the team. However, there are also achievements related to the internal challenges of the game, the U-Trials, and others that are obtained by completing the single player component and the tutorial. Precarious balance There are elements in Umbrella Corps that let us glimpse some interesting ideas: the way characters open doors or raise shutters, preparing to face whatever is beyond that barrier, with the possibility of shooting in the meantime; the mechanism that sees zombies attacking a soldier en masse when hit, making a noise or bleeding, opening up to potentially tantalizing strategies where you want to track someone down; or the ability to grab an undead and temporarily use it as a shield in a head-on collision with the opposing team. Unfortunately, none of this is implemented in a convincing way, there is really a lot of wood in the controls and the cover system does not help in that sense, indeed increasing the feeling of often and willingly getting stuck somewhere and not being able to avoid the enemy fire, thus feeling exposed and helpless rather than sheltered. As mentioned above, the performance of the Unity Engine leaves something to be desired and does not improve the general picture, which in itself relies excessively on terribly generic assets, which manage to repress the personality even of those scenarios that should actually at least evoke pleasant memories among Resident Evil fans, thanks to the lack of interactivity and the small size of each map. A completely similar speech can be made for the sound sector, which is functional as regards the effects, but here too anonymous and dull when it comes to the music.", "date": "2016-06-24", "grade": "4.5"}
