{"name": "WWE 2K16", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/158483-wwe-2k16-give-me-a-hell-yeah.html", "text": "The arrival of new consoles on the market is an exciting event for both gamers and developers, who can finally leave behind the limitations imposed by obsolete hardware and work to exploit the greater computational capacity. In the case of WWE 2K15, last year, this translated into a substantial graphic improvement, with new technologies for scanning real athletes and therefore greater fidelity of the relative polygonal models, albeit from the point of view of a ~mixed~ situation. which alternated particularly successful characters (the most famous: John Cena, Randy Orton, Triple H, Undertaker, etc.) with others clearly anchored to an old-gen workmanship. The 2015 edition was also the one that introduced a different approach in terms of gameplay, more ~simulating~ and reasoned than in the past, designed for a ~smart~ approach to sports entertainment; however, balancing these innovations with a less rich structure than usual in terms of superstars and available modes. WWE 2K16 explicitly sets itself the goal of remedying these shortcomings, offering an ever so rich roster (we are talking about over one hundred and twenty wrestlers) and going to enhance both the career mode and the character creation editor. WWE 2K16 offers more characters and content than the 2015 edition, but the experience remains the same Ring the bell! The main screen of WWE 2K16 allows access to all modes and boasts a clean and modern interface, but equally dynamic thanks to the slight movement of the athletes portrayed in the various photos. By accessing the ~Exhibition~ item, it is possible to select whether to play a one-on-one match, a couple match, a handicap match, a tournament and so on up to the famous Royal Rumble, the latter adjustable for ten, twenty or thirty participants . Each category therefore has further stipulations: normal match, Iron Man match, Falls Count Anywhere, Submission, Extreme Rules, Steel Cage, Ladder, TLC, Hell in a Cell and more. A little something is missing, for example the Inferno match, but they are practically details: in terms of the quantity of the offer, an excellent job has been done and the fans will not be disappointed. When it comes to selecting your own superstar, it features legends such as Rick Rude, ~Macho Man~ Randy Savage, various versions of Sting and ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin, of course Ultimate Warrior, Bret ~The Hitman~ Hart and even managers like Bobby ~The Brain~ Heenan, Miss Elizabeth, Paul Heyman, Jimmy Hart, Gerald Briscoe, Sensational Sherri and even recent names like Brad Maddox, Lana, Zeb Colter, Rosa Mendez and Mr. McMahon. Among the novelties of the gameplay there is also the possibility that our manager distracts the opponent to allow us to catch him off guard, so it is not a purely decorative element. On the editor front, a couple of previously featured options are missing, but the sheer amount of assets and possibilities is astounding, allowing us to create fighters that look exactly the way we want them to. There is one big problem: the preview of each change takes a few seconds to load, and this will irreparably lead less patient users to give up advanced editing and settle for superficial results. Deep If the ~Exhibition~ mode, with all its possibilities, is a first step in approaching WWE 2K16 and evaluating some of the changes introduced by the developers, it is the ~My Career~, ~2K Showcase~ and ~Universe~ modes that represent the most substantial part of the experience, capable of guaranteeing literally dozens of hours of entertainment. ~My Career~ resumes what was seen in the last edition: having created a character, we start from the Orlando Performance Center, this time dealing with Albert to replace Bill DeMott, and we try to climb by first passing through NXT and then landing on the main roster , in this case following a progression that doesn't stop at Wrestlemania but goes further. Some very nice solutions, such as the possibility of aligning between the ~face~ or the ~heel~ based on the behavior in the ring and the pre and post match declarations, with a view to a growth that obviously also affects other fields, in primarily the characteristics of the character we have created and its gradual enhancement. The ~2K Showcase~ mode this year revolves around the single figure of ~Stone Cold~ Steve Austin, and compared to past editions it seems to us a sensible choice: rather than examining individual storylines, the entire career of a superstar is retraced and this will inevitably open up to doing the same in the coming years, obviously focusing on different wrestlers. In a nutshell, however, welllittle has changed: we will retrace the matches of the Texas Rattlesnake from the beginning to the peak of his career, which as we know ended in a controversial way, in conjunction with the decision by WWE to divide the roster between Raw and Smackdown, but also and above all due to the injuries suffered over the years, some of which are potentially debilitating. Finally we have the ~Universe~ mode, which once again gives us complete control of the rosters and shows, with the aim of creating the most interesting feuds for the spectators and of playing the matches in first person or simply simulating them. Naturally, the multiplayer sector is added to this solid and tested system, which however it was not possible to test due to the momentary lack of online users: maybe we will come back with a box in the next few days. Playstation 4 trophies WWE 2K16 includes fifty-five Trophies, obtainable by thoroughly playing the various modes and performing particular maneuvers, such as breaking through the commentary table, eliminating a certain number of opponents during the Royal Rumble or unlocking better ~ranks~ in multiplayer online via victories. The Ultimate Wrestling? From a numerical point of view, the steps forward made by WWE 2K15 compared to last year's edition are evident: the product is more complete, richer, more varied thanks to the many new names (especially those from NXT) but equally attentive to details. An unfortunately fluctuating focus when moving from the main to the ~secondary~ superstars, and which once again creates an annoying technical imbalance. The realization of the game is in fact in a precarious balance: some wrestlers are really close to reality, others decidedly less so; the arenas are full of active audiences, but the rendering of the scenarios is decidedly ~old-gen~, probably due to generic textures and basic shaders; there are no uploads to break the rhythm of entries and part fought, but there are far too many when you get to grips with the editor. Unfortunately it's hard to think that next year the guys at Yuke's will finally be able to say that they have fixed all these flaws, small or large, and finally offer a coherent presentation in all its parts. However, the discussion also extends to the gameplay, given that some of the innovations introduced leave something to be desired: there is always the defect of the R2 backbone for ~instantaneous~ countermoves, but with a window that is too narrow for the success of the maneuver, thanks to the stroke of the key and a slight delay in the input; the ~rock, scissors, paper~ of tricks remained, a not exactly exciting solution to determine who controls the match; the management of submissions does not go well with the analog sticks of the controllers, asking to rotate them quickly but with cumbersome results; and finally the ~simulation~ philosophy leads this year too to a general slowness of the action, dotted with too many dead moments and situations in which our character remains on the ground for no valid reason. Nothing to say instead about the commentary, which is much improved and sees the commentators enrich their interventions by recalling, for example, the salient moments of the career of the superstars engaged in the ring.", "date": "2015-11-02", "grade": "7.5"}
