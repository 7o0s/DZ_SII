And it's not just because of its name, which for convenience we will often abbreviate to NES Mini throughout the text. It is difficult to talk about it and, above all, to judge it because it is a console that lives on nostalgia, a nostalgia that goes beyond generations and exerts its charm even on the youngest. Because maybe there is yes the hardened gamer who has been following mother Nintendo since the 80s and looks at the 8-bit era as one looks at a golden age of his younger and more optimistic self. But there is also the child of the 90s who met Super Mario from his cousin or uncle, and from there he was born as a full-fledged player. Although his first real home console may have been a Sega console, or Sony. But let's not forget that the word NES also exerts its influence on the younger ones, those kids who grew up on bread and counting pixels that longtime players look at with suspicion and sufficiency, but who today may be curious to see what that gameplay was like much praised by the ~old~. Here, for all of them the NES Mini can be the easiest way to go back in time, to that carefree gaming made up of low-quality CRT televisions and games sitting on a chair a few centimeters from the screen. Here's our verdict on the new Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System! Mini-Me What amazes about the NES Mini the first time you get your hands on it is how much smaller it is than the original. You can see unboxings with all kinds of fruit, but it's really impressive to see the eighties console live next to its younger and leaner clone. Once placed on the palm of the hand, then, the sensation is that of having to do with the first model of a newsstand retrogaming series. Very high fidelity. Every detail is in fact reproduced in great detail, from the lettering to the ventilation grilles, obviously passing through the cartridge flap. As we already knew, unfortunately these are purely aesthetic solutions and there is no hidden compartment for an SD card, much less space to insert an original game cartridge, which is ultimately as big as the console itself . Other differences concern the connection, which now takes place via a micro-USB port for power supply and an HDMI one for audio-video output. In this regard, the high-definition interface logo is proudly displayed on the back. Both cables, approximately 1.5m each, are included in the package. It may be of interest to collectors to know that this is a unique box for all of Europe and, as often happens with limited versions of Nintendo games, it can be identified as Italian only thanks to the blue corner on the barcode sticker. We assume that this is, among other things, the reason for the absence of the adapter for connection to the power outlet, given that the different European standards would have forced differentiated packaging. However, the Nintendo 3DS has now accustomed us to this anomaly and, for better or worse, we all have a mobile device that can help us with its grip. The package closes with a voucher to get 300 MyNintendo platinum points, a small, very retro, black and white manual with essential connection information, and a controller identical to that of the original console in all respects. However, the only and not negligible difference concerns the pad cable: in fact it is a wire that does not reach 80 cm and which uses the same connection as the additional Nintendo Wii controllers (such as Nunchuck and Classic Controller, which in turn it is perfectly compatible with NES Mini). Between the supplied cables and the controller, the maximum distance from the TV does not reach 3m, assuming then that you want to leave a couple of wires at ~limbo~ height for double fun during evenings with friends. The length of the controller cable is really too small for the needs of a living room and, waiting for extension cables and compatible third-party pads, it is clear that the NES Mini is better suited to being used on a desk, connected to the PC monitor, rather than sitting comfortably on the sofa. The console can also be powered via the USB ports of the PC, the monitor itself or, if necessary, even with a power bank. To see all the contents of the box you can refer to our unboxing below. Prices, games and pads Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System is sold at a recommended price of around 60 euros. It is then also possible to purchase a second additional controller, at a cost of around 10 euros. Additionally, Wii controllers can be used on the console; the stthis speech obviously does not apply to the Pro Wii U controller, the Wii Mote and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth peripherals in general. Finally, it should be remembered that there is no way to add titles to the thirty that are pre-installed. Back to the past Thirty classic 8-bit games are pre-installed inside Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System, which find space on a non-expandable 512MB flash memory (the complete list can be found here). Without going back to the big excluded, which we already talked about a few months ago, the selection of the European version follows the American one, as evidenced by the presence of a title dedicated to complicated football such as TECMO BOWL and the Nintendo of America writing that stands out at the start of each software. It follows that the games are all strictly in English. The NES Mini is turned on with the Power button exactly like the original and, after an initial configuration of the language, it immediately gives access to the game selection interface. With a style that recalls the shapes and colors of the console, here you can scroll through the titles present, sorting them by name, publisher, release date or according to use. There's also a demo mode that lets you see the games in action as the Mario brothers battle it out for control of the screen. At the top there are the various options, the QR Code to access the manuals (you can also find them here, including the paper pdf of the originals, essential for titles such as The Legend of Zelda) and legal information on the games and the emulator. Among other things, the source code of the open source parts should be published soon on the Nintendo site. Finally, in the lower part you have access to four save slots for each title. After selecting a game, there is no home button, nor a key combination to return to the interface using the NES controller; the only solution is to press the ~Reset~ button on the console, or use a Wii controller. Yet another demonstration that the console does not lend itself well to being too far away from the user. At that point it is possible to create a new suspension point, or overwrite an existing one with a nice animation. Perfect emulation Playing ROMs on the NES Mini is flawless, with no changes from the originals. An exception is a title like Punch-Out!!, which is proposed in the Featuring Mr. Dream version given the non-renewal of agreements with Mike Tyson back in 1990. It follows that there are also all the glitches we are used to, including some artifacts at the edges of the screen during lateral movement in Super Mario. Among the options, the three different game display modes stand out. In addition to the classic 4:3 display, NES games can be played in original resolution (~pixel perfect~ in English) or with a CRT filter that reproduces the scanlines effect (~scanlines~) typical of older televisions. The latter is perhaps a bit too accentuated and makes the image darker than that visible on average quality TVs, but it's still a nice option. The so-called pixel perfect mode, on the other hand, reproduces square pixels of the same processing size as the old NES. Be careful, because this way games seem slightly slower than 4:3, since the distances to travel are inevitably reduced; however, this is a matter of habit and both methods do justice to the originals. The NES Mini's video output is at 720p, which is more than enough resolution for games to play. The input lag instead depends exclusively on the TV and with a good gaming monitor there are no delays in the response of the commands.", "date": "2016-11-10", "grade": null}
