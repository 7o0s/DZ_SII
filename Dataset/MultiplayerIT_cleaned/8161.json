From Just Dance to Kids, passing through the ~monographic~ Michael Jackson Experience and Black Eyed Peas Experience. The latest addition was born in the wake of the latter, but with a completely ~black~ tracklist: The Hip Hop Experience is the definitive game for lovers of the genre. A proven formula The Hip Hop Experience does not upset the world of dance games and their now sequential structure and very similar to each other, but refers exactly to what was seen in the previous Ubisoft ~Experience~ chapters, with some small changes and obviously a completely new thematic trackist. For those who have lived on a remote island in the Pacific until now, we must specify that it is a dance game which, like all those of its kind, uses the Kinect camera to detect body movements and ~translate~ them on the screen into a score that rewards the fidelity of the moves made. During the game there is a character who performs the dance in front of our digital alter-ego seen from behind, so that the perspective helps to execute the movements in the right directions and in the right way, just as if we were in a gym looking at the 'instructor in front of us. The main mode is the one called Dance Party Mode in which we can start dancing alone or with a friend, initially choosing between three execution difficulties that completely modify the steps and moves to be performed starting from the ~simple~ repetitions of the standard choreographies, to the rapid succession of complicated ballets. Each move is synthesized by a ~card~, which appears on one side of the screen during the dances to let us anticipate the choreography. The level of challenge is certainly higher than the classic Just Dance because Hip Hop Experience offers a different, more complex style, that of the breakdance dance which is more technical and spectacularly difficult to perform for an average user like the writer (indeed, below average). If you want to play properly, however, before throwing yourself on the dance floor, it is a must to enter the ~Power Skooling~ mode, in which we are taught the steps that we will find in all the choreographies of the game, one by one, with the teacher virtual before us. For those less accustomed to dancing, it is also possible to slow down the movements in a sort of moviola to be able to understand them better and rehearse them endlessly with a continuous loop. Curiosity In the Hip Hop Experience game there are 750 choreographies, invented by some of the best artists in this field: Laurieann Gibson, Nicki Minaj's choreographer, Kid David who supervised ~Step Up 3D~ and the American edition of Dancing with the Stars, finally Dave Scott, dance director of ~So You Think You Can Dance~ and ~Battle of the Year~. In short, Ubisoft has taken the matter seriously and has hired some of the best choreographers in the world. The dress makes the monk In Hip Hop Experience there is a virtual shop in which we can buy clothes, shoes and accessories to modify and ~decorate~ our dancer starting from the feet up to hats, glasses and jewels (which are very themed with the game ). The customization of one's person is a fundamental part of the Hip Hop world, which bases a large part of its importance on style, aesthetic appearance and the ostentation of beauty through refined and unique clothes and accessories. This mode tends to satisfy all lovers of Hip Hop aesthetics, thanks to all its iconic brands typical of this world (from Timberland shoes to padded jackets, through sunglasses to brilliant and opulent necklaces). Hip Hop follows the rhythms and steps of breakdance but differs from the latter also in this predominant aesthetic aspect. Once we have created our perfect alter-ego, and perhaps similar to us, we can challenge any other dancer head-on. Or throw ourselves into the third game mode called ~Dance Marathon~, in which we have to dance virtually endlessly going from one song to another with a random and continuous musical shuffle, until obviously we manage to resist before arriving at the fateful Game Over. In a musical game, it is known that the greatest importance is that of the tracklist and the choice of the right pieces. Ubisoft has managed to put together a series of hits from the past and new ones that will undoubtedly make every lover of the genre happy, ranging from more commercial songs to Hip Hip cornerstones with a few years on their shoulders. We go from the great classics of Naughty by Nature, Mark Morrison and Rob Base up to the great onesinternational successes such as Wiz Khalifa's latest single ~Work hard, play hard~, Flo-Rida's ~Wild Ones~, LMFAO's ~Sexy and i Know it~. In between there are many nuances of hip hop, for example RnB with B.o.B. or R.Kelly, or Snoop Dogg's ~modern classics~ ~Drop it like is hot~, ~Run It!~ by Chris Brown, ~Lean Back~ by Terror Squad, ~Lollipop~ by Lil Wayne. Of a tracklist made up of 40 songs, nine are exclusive to the Xbox 360 version which thus proves to be the reference edition. Xbox 360 which is also perfect for this kind of games thanks to its Kinect which can perfectly detect the whole body with precision, but without severity.", "date": "2012-11-23", "grade": null}
