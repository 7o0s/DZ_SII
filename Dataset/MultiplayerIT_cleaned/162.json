{"name": "Super Mario 64", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-mario-64.html", "text": "What was it yesterday The year of grace was 1996, and the overbearing entry of the polygon into the world of electronic entertainment had both stimulated and confused many of the developers, who found themselves faced with the need to forcefully adapt old mechanics or create new ones by finding the right alchemy to make the fun end result. This undertaking is anything but simple, mind you. Fortunately, a man named Shigeru Miyamoto seemed to have quite clear ideas, succeeding in bringing the game that had revolutionized the world of two-dimensional platformers into 3D. And, also in this case, it was a revolution. A perfect alchemy between control system, graphics, gameplay and sense of exploration made Super Mario 64 a truly universally recognized masterpiece. And already 10 years ago, holding the three-cornered pad and taking control of the evergreen plumber, it was possible to concretely perceive the sensation of being in front of a historic passage, of playing with a product that would have indelibly marked the line between the past and future. So it was. What is it today With the Wii Virtual Console, today it is possible to relive (or experience for the first time for someone) those magical moments, for the cost of 1000 points equivalent to 10 euros. A slightly high figure, but which in any case is fully justified by the quality of a game that yesterday as today is capable of giving hours and hours of authentic fun. Often one is led to idealize the great titles of the past, only to be disappointed in many cases once they are picked up again and seen the weight that the passage of time has left. Playing Super Mario 64 is instead still an authentic pleasure, and the search for 120 stars can become the obsession of any ~modern~ gamer. The emulation is absolutely satisfactory, and using the 480p resolution an overall definition higher than the original is obtained, even if this obviously entails greater visibility of graphic defects. Nonetheless, even from a technical point of view, Super Mario 64 defends itself in a more than good way considering the years it carries on its back. The control system requires the use of a Classic Controller or the Gamecube pad: in both cases everything works beautifully without any kind of hitch. For anyone who has never played it, or simply for those who want to dive back into one of the most important and sincerely entertaining video games ever made, the purchase is therefore definitely recommended. There are many beautiful, very beautiful or excellent video games. Many fewer are those titles capable of indicating a new path to follow, of acting as milestones and as a reference for the entire industry. One of these is undoubtedly Super Mario 64, Miyamoto's masterpiece that accompanied the release of the Nintendo 64, making the launch of the latest cartridge console one of the most successful and thunderous in history. Unfortunately such a great beginning was not followed by an equally exciting life cycle, but that's another story...", "date": "2007-01-19", "grade": null}
