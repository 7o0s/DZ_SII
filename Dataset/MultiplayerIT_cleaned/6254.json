Since the first episode of the Arkham saga, the London team has in fact been able to pull action games out of their hat capable of perfectly recreating the universe of the popular DC Comics character, and finally doing justice to the figure of the masked hero also in the electronic field compared to a past in which, with some rare exceptions, he had never enjoyed much luck. A few years later, and after the interlude of Warner Bros. Games Montreal for Batman: Arkham Origins, Rocksteady Studios has taken over the reins of its creature and with the third chapter entitled Batman: Arkham Knight, which among other things seals the generational leap of the saga, aims to conclude (but will it be true?) in a spectacular way his personal trilogy on the Bat Man, supporting the project with a series of really not bad DLCs. Batman: Arkham Knight concludes the Dark Knight trilogy by Rocksteady Studios with dignity Hell in Gotham City Nine months after the Joker's departure in Batman: Arkham City, a certain tranquility seems to reign in Gotham. But it is only the classic calm before the storm: in fact, on the horizon, the figure of Scarecrow stands out menacingly, determined to detonate a series of bombs containing a new strain of his hallucinogenic chemical toxin. After the evacuation of the city following a first attack, a handful of police officers led by Commissioner James Gordon, and Batman, assisted by a group of allies, remain to defend it. For the Dark Knight the battle promises to be harsh as never before: tormented by his inner demons, torn apart in the depths of his soul by remorse and by a figure who ideally accompanies him at every step, the hero must also deal with a new enemy , the Arkham Knight, a character that Rocksteady Studios created working closely with Geoff Johns, creative director of DC Comics Entertainment. Vengeful and with psychopathic tendencies, but at the same time intelligent, patient and calculating, this sort of nemesis of Batman seems to know his moves in advance, as well as many of his secrets, and will therefore work on these and other elements to challenge him head on in the field. His ultimate goal, like that of other criminals such as Two-Face and the Penguin, is not only to get his hands on the city, but also to permanently destroy the superhero, annihilating him blow after blow both from a psychological and physical point of view . A destiny that, for personal reasons, the crazy and sensual Harley Quinn would also like to reserve for him. The real adventure begins on the eve of Halloween, with the Bat Man who under a violent storm watches over the streets from above, in a practically empty city, apart from a few police patrols and hordes of criminals who swarm through the streets. The glance offered to the player by this first scene is nothing short of exceptional, with a Gotham that seen from above seems alive, with the gangs carrying out vandalism, robbing banks or arguing among themselves, the agents on board the police cars they chase the criminals or are in turn chased by the latter, determined to kill them. This sensation is confirmed immediately afterwards, when one finds oneself moving along the roofs and in the street, acting in a world characterized by lighting and a rendering of materials capable of making one perceive physical, credible and diversified in the scenarios as truly few others. Aboard the Batmobile Among other things, different environments offer an interesting degree of exploration to allow the player a minimum of freedom of choice on the paths to take to face the enemy, or perhaps to complete one of the many secondary game sessions. But we will talk more about all this later. Returning to the main adventure, the duration of which is around 15 hours but can vary depending on the level of difficulty and the way you choose to play, despite the semblance of free roaming and the very conformity of the city, ideally ~built~ on a much larger area than the one present in Arkham City, this takes place substantially as in the previous episode, ideally taking up the structure of an action title with adventurous, stealth and fighting game elements, but at the same time smoothing out the (small) flaws, and expanding its possibilities in terms of gameplay and content. A concrete example of what has just been written is the introduction of the Batmobile into the game. The interaction between the superoe and his car is in fact a key element of the gameplay, and as if to underline this aspect, the new design of the Bat Man's costume was conceived in a way not unlike the armored and technological one of the car. This monster of automotive and military engineering can be used in two different modes that can be changed at any time by holding down L2; with the car the hero can perform a thousand functions, such as moving comfortably around the city during patrols, intimidating the enemies on foot who flee at his sight (or attack him if armed with a rifle), but also communicate with allies who provide him with logistical support, such as Alfred, the Oracle and Lucius, deactivate bombs, solve some of the Riddler's challenges (including time trials). And when needed even chase the criminals who flee aboard other vehicles and fight the drones. In the first case, it is possible to set off chasing the criminals in breathtaking races along the city streets where a good maneuvering skill is required to avoid crashing or being thrown off the road. The control among other things is not bad, always considering that this is not a driving game, and the car is mastered without any problems whatsoever. During the chase, Batman can use his car's paraphernalia to break through and jump over any obstacles (he can also knock them down by force), block the fugitives' car and force them to surrender, or eliminate them completely with a well-aimed missile. In more extreme cases, that is, when the masked hero is faced with the Arkham Knight's drones, tanks and helicopter, he can then switch to the ~state~ of Battle. By holding down the L2 key, the machine becomes a sort of futuristic vehicle with a full 360-degree range of movements, and armed to the teeth with all sorts of goodies depending on the upgrades implemented. As with Batman's suit and abilities, the Batmobile can in fact also be improved in terms of characteristics through the points that are obtained by chasing down criminals, increasing the level of experience and completing some challenges. In this way it becomes possible to make pre-existing skills more effective, such as dodging, armor or running propulsion, or to integrate new ones provided by WayneTech. These include an EMP generator that releases a devastating electrical pulse, and a ~drone virus~ that causes opponents to attack each other among other things. In any case, the firefights with the mechanical departments of the Arkham Knight are quite difficult, especially when the Cobras come into play, very powerful means that must be eliminated with a bit of strategy, hitting them in a specific weak point and paying attention not to fight them head on, on pain of almost instantaneous death. But in the long run, especially when you've upgraded the Batmobile and are frequently fighting cheesy enemies, they get a little repetitive. Dulcis in fundo, the vehicle can interact with the Batwing, which acts as a support aircraft to transport and integrate some of the upgrades mentioned, and can also be controlled remotely. In case of need, the Batmobile can be used remotely, perhaps to unhinge doors and portions of the scenery with the winch, to get around and attack the enemies besieging the Bat Man from behind, and in some cases even to allow the hero to perform a few special moves in combination with it. In fact, Batman can exit and enter the vehicle at any time, even by jumping from a building and before touching the ground, slingshot inside it with a plastic move before darting away at full speed. It's better as a couple The Batmobile therefore thickens the usual combination of stealth combat with which the hero usually faces the rabble that he happens to cross on the street or infiltrating inside some buildings. In this sense, it must be said that the melee mechanics remain very similar to those that fans have come to know over time, even if they are re-proposed in a more dynamic and spectacular form. In fact, the feeling with the controls and with the things to do has remained unchanged: if anything, the best response to the commands of a massive but very reactive Batman changes, and the addition of several new micro options capable of giving greater depth to the tested combat system. During a confrontation, for example, you can take advantage of the elements of the scenario to inflict more damage or a quick KO to your opponents or, thanks to a series of new moves, throw them into the air, grab them and crash them against their friends. The enemies, for their part, appear as expected in diverse ~versions~, but this time in greater quantities, thus making up for the number of behavioral routines that largely follow those of Arkham City, at least as regards the classic thugs of the series. This translates into a certain repetitiveness in the long run, especially when for large stretches you find yourself fighting with super criminals and you have to repeat the same practice too many times, such as getting to eliminate an intermediate boss and then concentrate on rest of the ~troop~, or wait to see the counter-move indicator appear on the heads of the opponents and press the appropriate key. But it is a typical ~defect~ of the genre, on which enthusiasts are always willing to turn a blind eye, especially in the face of the goodness of everything else. In any case, gang members also have some new abilities, such as the ability to charge headlong, in the past the prerogative of only some opponents, and the ability to react better to incoming attacks by dodging and counterattacking somewhat more sensible. Obviously quite difficult, at least at the level of the game on maximum difficulty, the men of the Knight of Arkham turn out to be, if only because they can count on marked military skills, on the support of doctors capable of charging their fellow soldiers with electricity to make them inflict damage contact only and, as mentioned before, of drones and armored vehicles. Especially in the areas they monitor, it becomes essential to act silently, taking full advantage of those stealth mechanics that involve the use of air ducts, grates and handholds to hide and strike. Here too there is no shortage of new ways to surprise enemies and eliminate them from every angle, with the added possibility of being able to launch directly into the air ducts with the help of the grappling hook, or to use the Multi KO Terror, which joins the classic silent one. With this move, which is activated when a bat-shaped indicator under the health bar is charged, up to a maximum of three opponents can initially be neutralized in a single solution, with a spectacular slow motion effect, even starting from a hidden position . In some moments of the adventure the Dark Knight can then resort to the help of allies such as Robin, Nightwing and Catwoman thanks to the new Dual Play system. The player is supported by the artificial intelligence that moves precisely one of these characters, but only during some missions in specific areas since each of them is connected to a case or to a certain super villain he is investigating. During the clashes, however, it is possible to take control of it with the simple pressure of the usual L1 backbone, letting Batman be taken over by the game, and once a special bar is filled, it is even possible to carry out pair combos to inflict a joint KO on the opponents . The system, with its sudden shifts in front and its shots devoted to spectacularization, appears a little disorienting at first, but gradually it proves to be quite simple and fun to master. Furthermore, in our opinion, it is a nice way to expand Free Flow Combat and let you savor its new aspects. Playstation 4 trophies Batman: Arkham Knight offers 69 Trophies between normal and secret. Most are obtainable by completing certain story missions, eliminating a certain number of enemies, winning a certain number of Riddler or AR challenges, or simply progressing through the main adventure. Crimes and Misdemeanors It is essential to spend a few more words on the management of the levels and the consequent freedom offered to the player, which we mentioned at the beginning. In fact, between one main mission and another, a series of secondary activities can be carried out which, as per tradition for the series, fill the adventure by giving it a certain variety. In addition to randomly generated ones, such as police calls for emergency services, or Riddler and AR riddles and challenges, just press the pad's d-pad right to quickly access a ~wheel~ menu where you can select one of the many alternative missions available. Who is the opera-loving serial killer littering the streets of Gotham City with corpses? Who is behind the hideous creature that flies over buildings terrorizing even criminals, and who is setting fire to all the fire stations in the city? There are several crimes to keep Batman busy even outside the main adventure and stimulate him to visit every corner of Gotham City, thanks to the good variety of level design that leads the user to scour scenarios", "date": "2015-06-19", "grade": "9.5"}
