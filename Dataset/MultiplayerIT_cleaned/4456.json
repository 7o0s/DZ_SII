{"name": "Portal with RTX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/portal-with-rtx-recensione.html", "text": "Portal was originally released as part of the Orange Box, the greatest collection of games ever made, which also included Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two and Team Fortress 2, plus some bonuses. At the time, the adventure of Chell, the Test Subject #1 that the mad computer GlaDOS wanted to get rid of after making her try the Portal Gun, was seen as a kind of Cinderella of the group. Over time, however, Portal has rightfully risen to classic status, especially after the launch of Portal 2, which has developed themes and mechanics to such an extent that it has become one of the most acclaimed games of all time. Nvidia decided to build on that experience to build a demo product for its new 40-series GPUs. Then it boosted Valve's title with ray tracing, DLSS and all of its most modern graphics technologies, to give you a chance to taste them in complete way. To find out if it's worth playing again, read our review of Portal with RTX, a free DLC dedicated to all owners of the latest or penultimate generation Nvidia cards. Let's recap Portal with RTX offers excellent raytraced reflections Replaying Portal is always a pleasure, especially if you haven't done it for some time and don't remember the solutions to all the puzzles. The game is always the same: in the role of Chell we must first carry out GlaDOS' orders by passing several test rooms with the Portal Gun in hand, then we must find a way to escape her wrath, until we arrive at the final confrontation with the mega computer itself . The gameplay is all based on the use of the very special weapon, which can create two interconnected portals on some flat surfaces, so as to allow you to reach otherwise inaccessible areas and use the few available objects in a creative way. For example, the iconic pet cubes can be dropped on turrets, or paths can be created to bring energy spheres to some switches. As the adventure continues, the puzzles become more and more intricate and require more reflection, as well as mastering the use of portals to perfection. Everything is played strictly in the first person, without any inopportune filmed sequence and constantly accompanied by the voice of GlaDOS, whose dialogues are not only hilarious, but also written in an exceptional way. In short, the cake remains a lie here too, but with an excellent taste. What's new in the version with RTX The game is always that The novelties introduced by the DLC Portal with RTX are all graphics. Considering that it's completely free if you own the base game, it's certainly a great way to see some advanced RTX GPU effects in action, but if we were you we wouldn't expect some kind of miracle. Portal of its own has never shone from a technical point of view. Indeed, thinking only of the graphics it was the worst title of the Orange Box. Not that it was bad, but it had a design thought out in a completely functional way to the type of gameplay it proposed, made up of large and bare rooms, therefore devoid of many distractions, and some ~behind the scenes~ with crates and other surrounding objects. Portal with RTX adds DLSS 3, the latest version of Nvidia's upscaling technology based on the use of artificial intelligence, which makes the experience generally smoother even at higher resolutions, without sacrificing maximum quality, and raytracing, which greatly improves reflections, lighting, transparency and so on. The textures and some three-dimensional models have also been updated, now much more modern in appearance and useful for higher resolutions, such as 4K. In short, the modernization work has certainly been there and gives a certain pleasure, also giving a good excuse to replay the entire title. However, do not expect a revolution in the visual style or to remain speechless in the face of who knows what marvel, because Portal is still a 2007 title, which largely continues to appear as such. It was probably chosen for its fame and for the fact that it will certainly have caused fewer problems than others in the extreme implementation of certain effects. A bit like what happened with the raytraced version of Minecraft or with Quake II RTX. Of course, seeing the light reflecting more realistically on the surfaces or the glass having more elaborate refractions is not bad, but the pleasure does not last long and leaves the time it finds. At the end of the day, take it for what it is: a demonstration project that visually updates a classic, without changing it.", "date": "2022-12-08", "grade": "8.0"}
