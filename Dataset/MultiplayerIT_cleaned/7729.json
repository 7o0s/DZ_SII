Do they meditate? Do they remove and wax? Do they write haiku? Not at all. We are in 2013, traditions are dead, the world economic system is collapsing and therefore even the old oriental sages are adapting. Fist Puncher, for example, loves to judge beauty contests and remembers having to meditate only when the girls are kidnapped by a gang of criminals. Fortunately there are his numerous students to help him (he has to offer lessons at a discount, otherwise it is not explained). Three big boys, a girl and a unicorn (the one from Robot Unicorn Attack, a series also published by Adult Swim Games) then set off in search of the unfortunate women, who are transported by weight to different parts of the city. In reality, there are sixteen selectable characters in total (the unicorn is a DLC), only the rest must be unlocked first. However, everything translates into many punches, several kicks and even some horse neighing, that is, in a classic Double Dragon-style horizontal scrolling fighting game, presented in pixel art graphics to pretend to have fallen from some old eighties system. It remains to be understood how the nostalgia operation went. Fist Puncher is a pixelated punch at the squalor of modern life The right punch In reality Fist Puncher is not as immediate to play as it would seem. To fight you must use four keys (punches, kicks, jump and grips) to be combined as needed to do greater damage. Mind you that it certainly does not require a degree to be appreciated, also because the fundamental concepts are all explained in the tutorial and by some messages that appear on the screen, however some mechanics are more complicated than they seem, especially until the system has been assimilated control. The general map In short, you need to give yourself a couple of levels of time to start getting serious and introject the right action times. From then on, the Team2Bit title opens and reveals all its best cards. Divided into fifty levels, Fist Puncher is an extreme tribute to a genre almost forgotten by the masses. The aim is to clean up the levels from the enemies to the sound of barrels (there are some variants, such as the motorcycle levels, in which, in any case, a massacre always requires races), including bosses, accumulating the experience necessary to level up and make grow the characteristics of the character used in perfect RPG style. In addition to the four basic attributes, it is possible to learn additional techniques or powers of a different nature. For example, one of these allows you to completely heal yourself by making a particularly long combo, or you can take a spinning kick that is performed by pressing two keys simultaneously. From this point of view Fist Puncher does not lack variety and offers different content practically until the end of the adventure. The presence of very different characters significantly raises the replayability factor, so we don't hesitate to say that if you get involved you will continue to punch pixelated enemies for several hours. The enemies are also very varied and range from the classic scrambled criminals, to the inevitable zombies, passing through all the fauna that the genre has taught us to know. There is no shortage of explicit references to other titles, such as the level on the truck that closely reminded us of Dragon Ninja. Violent punches The scrolling fighting game genre, which has declined somewhat in recent years, sees many exponents who, especially in the late 80s and 90s, crowded arcades all over the world. Many trace its birth back to Double Dragon by Taito (1987), but in reality the title starring the Lee brothers only marked its first major commercial success and set the standards for future productions. In previous years, important exponents such as Kung-Fu Master (Irem, 1984) or Renegade (Taito, 1986) had already been published, which had brought the genre to the attention of an ever wider audience. However, the magnification came thanks to Capcom and its Final Fight (1989), from which a real vein of the Japanese company started which counts countless masterpieces (Cadillac & Dinosaurs just to name one), some of which are still re-proposed today (see the recent Dungeons and Dragons pack). Obviously, even the home systems tried to have their say. In addition to the conversions of arcade titles, more or less successful depending on the system, the Street of Rage series for Sega Genesis, or Megadrive if you prefer, should certainly be mentioned, which is still the object of love by fans. Unfortunately there are many other titles that should be included in this quick roundup, but space is tight. Be satisfied with these hints. Parry failed Obviously notAll that glitters is gold and Fist Puncher has some flaws. First, the control system has proved unpredictable at times. In the requirements it is recommended to use an Xbox 360-like controller, but we were better off with the keyboard. The reason? With the joypad it often happened that we started running without wanting to, or, in other cases, pressing the keys did not produce the desired move. Using the keyboard, all this did not happen, but let's assume that part of the problems may have depended on us. What is not our fault is a certain inaccuracy of some shots, some holds by the opponents that were successful even if we were outside the safe distance and some ingenuity that we would have frankly avoided. The gameplay itself, despite the care taken, suffers from a typical defect of the genre: in the long run it can become repetitive. Fifty levels are not a few and in the final stages it is a bit difficult to move forward. Of course, little or nothing could have been done about this, but we point it out to you in good conscience. From a graphic point of view, the screenshots and the video are enough. Fist Puncher makes no secret of being a tribute to the 80s and doesn't want to squeeze your graphics card, so there are only two possibilities: either you like the vintage style, or you will despise it. It happens when you make such extreme choices. Last Missing is a multiplayer mode worthy of the name. If you want it is possible to play in two on the same computer, but given how much the gaming experience gains from the presence of a friend, it would have been nice to be able to play online too. Hopefully some patch will fix this.", "date": "2013-07-12", "grade": "8.0"}
