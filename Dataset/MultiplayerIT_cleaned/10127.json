Many titles don't even reach the twenty hours that Awakening can offer (23 for yours truly, who, apart from completion compulsions, already had 110 hours of Dragon Age behind him...): in terms of duration and objective, the whole experience reminded us enough of the most classic add-ons of yesterday's BioWare (Tales of the Sword Coast, Throne of Bhaal) enough to evoke a few tears. The epilogue of Origins had left us worthy heroes of Farelden and rightly so - six months later - we find ourselves not only Commanders of the Gray Wardens of the kingdom, but also the holders of the fiefdom of Amaranthine. With everyone obediently at our beck and call, lands, castles and a king for snack time, life couldn't get any better (we even have our own personal seneschal!). Too bad about the usual darkspawn infestation, which continues to cause trouble despite the end of the invasion. Add to the premise that some of these creatures have inexplicably begun to speak and appear to be cunning and even intelligent, and the mystery thickens enough for our hero to decide to take matters into his own hands. Role-playing, from good to better As expected, the main ingredients of Awakening are the same as those of Origins, as is the target audience: new regions to explore, quests and dungeons are the foundations of the expansion's contents, seasoned with a generous dose of objects, sets of armor and dozens of new talents and skills, which take advantage of the increase in the level cap, which now reaches the thirty-fifth. Many of these elements are introduced in a more refined, elaborated or in some cases simply different form, which is probably due to the contribution of people other than the original Origins team, who have evidently experimented with alternative approaches to the core mechanics of the game. For example, some dungeons have non-strictly linear conformations, with optional paths - or even quests - that can help avoid enemy ambushes or provide other kinds of support. The whole question of choices, so central to BioWare's style of role-playing, offers more ambiguous dilemmas, where there is often no clear or simply no distinction between good and evil, but where there will still be consequences. such as to emotionally impact the player. The new talents/powers that can be acquired are also excellent: wizards tend to still be a bit too powerful and some of the combos they can put in place are absolutely out of scale compared to thieves and warriors, but in general the playability is there and the fun mashed potato. Then there is a whole series of small innovations that represent the flagship of the expansion because they differentiate it from Origins. First of all, the management of the restructuring of our fortress which not only gives us something to spend the mountains of money we have now accumulated, but requires some further choices on the allocation of troops and on the materials to be used to equip them and to reinforce the walls. All cleverly integrated through the game's dialogue system; we look forward to seeing the mods that the community will bring forth with such flexible tools. Crafting also gets some additions, with new recipes for existing professions and the new rune crafting skill. The latter is also necessary for the crafting of more powerful items, as always courtesy of Master Wade, who makes his welcome return as the Gray Wardens' favorite unofficial blacksmith. Indeed, as expected, what Awakening shines in are above all the NPCs and their stories, motivations and personalities, which in fact eclipse our protagonist as the least interesting character in the story. We can choose to recruit six new recruits, two for each class, with Oghren who is actually the only veteran of the previous chapter, each with their own personal quest, growth path and splendid dialogues. If you find a kitten on the street, get ready for some absolutely brilliant scenes, which will not make you miss Minsk and its hamster for the more elderly. And the side characters are no less, starting with Wade and his partner, always full of absolutely hilarious gay humor, not to mention the dwarfs who work in our fortress, the caustic fortification expert (barely disgusted by the human engineering works ) to that addect to explosives (a crazy dwarf with too much gunpowder is one of the most timeless fantasy clichs). Not just for medalists If for some unjustifiable reason you haven't finished Origins, there's nothing to worry about, access to Awakening takes place through a new game to be created for the occasion and which can be recalled from the game menu of which this is the first expansion. It is therefore not necessary to have completed the adventure and it will be possible to both import your own character and create a brand new one. Some not-so-bright looks... Inevitably Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening is not a perfect title, the victim of a certain propensity to put the player in front of numerous bugs, more or less small and annoying: quest triggers and events that fail, pathfinding of the characters that takes a pause, leaving them stuck, overlays of special effects that the graphics engine reproduces with horrific dismemberments... the list goes on. Nothing so serious and unforgivable, but Awakening is evidently less refined and clean than Origins and the advice is to keep regular saves close to each other. Then there's the question of difficulty: on Normal difficulty the game doesn't offer enough of a challenge for those who care about a well-designed and equipped character and, unless you increase the difficulty, the only drops of sweat you'll shed will be for encounters with bosses (and only for their abnormal amount of life). In fact, by the end of the game power creep will reign supreme and you'll have more high-level abilities than you can realistically use in the longest of battles, a clear case of design that has preferred showmanship and plenty of customization over balance. It will be interesting to understand the approach that BioWare will take to let us develop these characters further, despite the complexity of 35 levels for now 15 specialization classes. A minor but equally tangible flaw concerns the poor links with Origins. Beyond a few initial dialogues and the meeting with the ruler of Farelden (whichever you have chosen...) the game proceeds by providing few narrative hooks, some of which are apparently hasty. For example, our meeting with a character from the previous game, here in the simple guise of an NPC with a quest to assign us, had something surreal. Towards the end of Origins we parted on bad terms (we were a little mean on a couple of occasions...) and rightly so as soon as he saw us, the character in question unloaded the most offensive phrase in the game on us . Too bad that from the immediately following dialogue, as if in the throes of amnesia, he returned to having his always benevolent and altruistic air, leaving us to our business, even worrying about the time he had made us lose. Finally, the aspect that perhaps annoyed us the most was to note that without having read the novel The Calling, a spin-off of the series and the second printed volume dedicated to Dragon Age, much of the plot is not incomprehensible, but at least unexplained. Both main and secondary characters make their appearance unannounced, often mentioned without context and in general, if you don't want to miss much of the background, buying the book (or jumping on Wikia) is a must.", "date": "2010-03-23", "grade": "8.0"}
