{"name": "Asphalt: Urban GT", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asphalt-urban-gt.html", "text": "Portable asphalt Asphalt Urban GT essentially presents itself as a pocket synthesis of two pillars of the arcade racing game genre, namely Need for Speed and Burnout. In fact, almost all of the playful structure of the Gameloft product rests on concepts extrapolated from the two titles in question, elements that the developers have in any case been able to re-propose with discreet skill. But let's go in order. Asphalt Urban GT offers the player the possibility to try his hand at individual challenges in the Arcade mode (the classic Free Race and Time Attack and the unconvincing police chase), to compete with other players via Bluetooth or to face a full-bodied career mode, here called evolution. Focusing initially on this last option, it must be said that Gameloft has had a good time inserting all the characteristics of a self-respecting racing game: there is therefore a large scoreboard of competitions to face (mini-championships composed of three races each divided into categories and progressively unlockable), a Dealership where you can buy new cars and a Garage useful for displaying your cars and possibly modifying them in order to make them more performing. These operations which, as expected, require the investment of the money earned as a result of good positions in racing or obtained from the sale of surplus cars. In short, nothing new under the sun, but the convincing quality with which everything on N-Gage was made manages to easily make us forget the lack of originality of the Gameloft product. In fact, Asphalt Urban GT offers the user the possibility to choose from around twenty licensed cars, characterized by a remarkable polygonal modeling and sufficiently diversified road behaviour. Also from the point of view of the tracks on which to compete, the work done by the programmers seems well done: the ten courses are set within urban scenarios inspired by some characteristic cities such as Miami, Cuba and Paris, and are built with skill and quite different from each other. Run boy over there In the purely course phase, Asphalt Urban GT succeeds in the far from simple feat of giving the user a pleasant gaming experience, albeit not free from defects and inaccuracies. The arcade nature of the game is also reflected in the control system, essentially made up of dedicated accelerator, brake and turbo keys. As in Burnout, in fact, in the Gameloft title it is possible to accumulate boost by reaching high speeds and darting dangerously through city traffic, to then free it and thus make the speedometer needle fly. In this sense, Asphalt Urban GT gives a good sensation of speed, favored by a frame rate that is certainly not stellar but still constant: the downside is constituted by a visible amount of clipping, which however falls within more than acceptable values, especially considering the graphic goodness of the Gameloft product. In addition to the aforementioned quality of the car models, the solidity of the game settings should also be noted, as well as the presence of some absolutely appreciable light effects. The various races therefore turn out to be pleasant, supported by a discreet driving model (which, however, appears too lenient) and by a sufficiently competitive AI of the opponents. Note of demerit instead for the collisions, the only big drawback of Asphalt Urban GT. Hitting a car in front of us gives rise to an annoying ~magnet effect~, while a head-on with a car coming from the opposite direction of travel leads to nothing more than an unthinkable spin, with, moreover, an absolutely minimal loss of speed. Another weak point of the Gameloft title is the sound, rather anonymous and not very varied especially as regards the effects. Comment Asphalt: Urban GT is a quantitatively very rich racing game, which due to some gaps in the gameplay fails to reach peaks of excellence, but which nonetheless proves to be one of the best exponents of its genre available for N-Gage. Definitely remarkable from a graphic point of view, the Gameloft title offers a rather simple and derivative play structure, but perfectly capable of satisfying the needs of Nokia users looking for some pocket speed. Pros: Good graphics Wide choice of cars and tracks Evolution mode very rich Cons: Control system not perfect Very rough collisions It tends to become repetitive Although N-Gage is not exactly the most suitable console for lovers of four wheels, this does not deny it the right to be able to boast of its own all-speed racing arcade gameand dream cars. And Gameloft promptly thought of paying homage to the Nokia handheld with a course title which, to tell the truth, borrows more than a few ideas from the most titled products. But luckily, it's a ~looting~ for a good purpose...", "date": "2005-01-10", "grade": null}
