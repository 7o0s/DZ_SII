{"name": "Hellgate: London - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hellgate-london-recensione.html", "text": "Enter Hellgate The first action required of the player is trivially to create his own alter ego, personalizing it in the aesthetic aspect - through a very complete editor - and choosing a class for him. These, in total six, are divided according to the faction with which you side. Guardians and Masters of Blades, melee combat tanks, with the former more oriented towards area damage, belong exclusively to the order of the Templars, a group of valiant men with the sole purpose of saving the human race. Invokers and Mystics, respectively a support class and the classic spell caster, are instead the professions available to the Cabalists, a sort of sect with dark ends and with a dangerous harmony with the powers of demons. Finally, the hunters, cold and with their only survival in mind, offer Sharpshooters and Engineers, capable of building technological support or attack machines that make up for their shortcomings in combat. A non-original but complete overview, which all in all fits well with the dynamics of the developed gameplay. Although the first person view - which can still be switched to third at any time - gives the feeling of playing a shooter, the focus of the experience is entirely focused on growing one's virtual self. By defeating enemies and completing missions you earn experience points and, having reached the next level, you find yourself with more life, magic points and some new skills that you can unlock or upgrade. The skill tree, different for each class, is quite varied and articulated, dividing into three further branches that offer as many ideas and choices, it being understood that they can be mixed together in the mad race for the perfect character. The game interface is quite traditional and customizable with the map, statistics and the bar that collects items and spells, always in plain sight. The inventory, on the contrary, is in the old - actually old - style, presenting itself in blocks in which to arrange the objects, with little space for everything and without a button that automatically manages the ordering by gender, size or name . Let's hope for a patch. The commands are not placed in a different way from what is usually experienced, resulting overall valid. Good idea without perspective Throughout the course of the adventure you will have to face a series of increasingly long, complex dungeons full of monsters of increasing power. As a habit, this continuous alternation of exploration and slaughter is justified by the objectives assigned by the NPCs, whether they are for the completion of the main plot or for the simple collection of special objects. Whether it's underground tunnels or the devastated streets of London, the areas of collision and junction between resistance assembly points are randomly generated. The setting is therefore the same, but the structure of the paths, the spawn of enemies and the arrangement of objects vary with each passage. If this choice, not new but still little used, guarantees an always constant feeling of restlessness and uncertainty, compromises are often made with an unsatisfactory and badly calibrated level design, which leaves entire areas without interest. Everything described up to now can also be experienced in multiplayer, through the appropriate mode that can be selected at the start of each game. The groups must be formed in the common areas and, after leaving them, you enter the usual, randomized dungeons, this time more difficult and generous in terms of rewards. For those who want a more substantial experience - which goes beyond the rather standard one described so far - it is possible to subscribe to a special monthly subscription for around 7 euros. The developers promise constant additions from all points of view and what is already available cannot be ignored: a Hardcore mode, where greater prestige is sold at the high price of never having to die, otherwise the character will be deleted, some special arenas for PvP, the option to create guilds and tons of extra weapons and items, plus a few other small improvements. So much material, that if it were included in the price of the package it would represent a considerable advance in the overall evaluation. The over twenty hours of longevity are more than enough, bearing in mind the further perspective of the online game, but it is the tiredness that the action shows after a few sessions that does not convince, between endlessly repeated tasks and never unforgettable clashes. Ups and downs Comment The missed opportunity is evident, as there is no way to glimpse the masterpiece qualities that one might expect. The always different dungeons or the six classes are not enough, all in allwell characterized, to erase the flaws related to an action that is struggling to take off. The setting given to the gameplay, with an action RPG structure combined with a view initially set in the first person, does not bring a tangible innovation, revealing itself as an end in itself. The good management of the character remains, the fascinating setting and the amusing first hours, which if combined with the multiplayer - able to revive identification and fun, in part - make it a product at least worth trying for fans. Pros Good rendering of decayed London Large number of characters and their abilities, for guaranteed customization Cons Poor level design Not as entertaining as it should Lots of interesting content for subscribers only PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Windows XP Processor: 1.8 GHz Processor RAM: 1 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 6200 and ATI Radeon 9000 Pro Disk Space: 12 GB Minimum Requirements Windows Vista Processor: Pentium 4 3.2 GHz or Intel Core 2.2 GHz or AMD Athlon 3200 RAM : 2 GB Video Card: NVidia GeForce 8800 recommended to use DirectX 10 Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core QX6700 RAM: 2 GB Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 GTS 320MB Hellgate: London is available for PC. The problem with overly anticipated games is that, when they don't convince, they're greeted with the idea of being described for what they could have been but aren't. Flagship Studios, developer of this Hellgate London, is made up of a large part of the team that years ago completed the masterpiece Diablo: it is therefore obvious that when a new action RPG was announced, the press and fans were seized by the idea of to be able to have a new milestone in your hands. Unfortunately and as we are about to describe in the following lines, a good part of the initial enthusiasm is dampened by a series of defects of primary importance, which put a strain on the ability not to dismiss everything as a disappointment, requiring digging under the zest in search of a series of good elements that are present. The narrative cue is not very original but, making use of the always fascinating London in the background, it is quite pleasant and well written. The year is 2038 and when the player takes over the reins of history, by now all that remains of the English capital is the ruins, swept away as it is by years of destruction and terror due to the demons that once appeared from a rift space-time. In this extreme situation, where the few survivors gather underground to organize a hint of resistance and coordinate the exits on the surface, some heroes wear the uncomfortable clothes of last hope, a faint light in total darkness.", "date": "2007-11-22", "grade": null}
