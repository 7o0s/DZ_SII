There's a lot of third-person action, loads of sports games, and a disproportionate amount of twin stick shooters. However, if each of these genres can count on at least a couple of truly representative titles, a huge breach is left by turn-based strategy games. There are several RisiKo clones, for heaven's sake, and with Mecho Wars iPhone and iPod Touch users were able to experience an experience very similar to that offered by an Advance Wars, but the equivalent of Fire Emblem for Apple devices was still missing. With a pedigree that can count on some of the creators of the Command & Conquer series, the Jet Set Games development team has thus decided to put a patch on this lack. Highborn is just what you'd expect from a game heavily inspired by the classics of the turn-based tactics genre. Set in a traditional fantasy world, populated by knights, sorcerers and evil creatures, the title places the player at the helm of a small army, with the aim of overcoming the challenges that will be proposed to him from time to time. It will almost always be a matter of eliminating all the enemies in the scenario, or simply taking out their leader before your armies are pulverized, repeating more or less the same formula throughout the eight levels available so far. Mead strategy Just like in Fire Emblem, a grid allows you to move your units around the map, showing a 3D sequence only during fights. After having planned your strategy and moved your 'pawns' on the playing field, it will be time to attack or defend yourself from enemy aggression. Although the rock-paper-scissors system implemented in many other games is shamelessly unclear, once again the various units gain advantages or disadvantages based on the type of opponents they face, their remaining energy or the conditions of the battlefield. Another element in common with similar titles is the presence of heroes, special characters decidedly stronger than average and endowed with particular abilities, whose death could compromise the outcome of the entire battle. To make it an absolutely unique game, however, is the fact that each of your strategies will depend on the surrounding structures: the conquest of outposts, towers and monasteries is an operation which cannot be ignored, essential for weakening the opposing defenses to strengthen the yours. By subtracting a tower from the enemy, for example, not only do you get hold of a new weapon with which to attack from afar, but the wizard who lives there will be your ally as long as you have control over the structure. This last detail, needless to say, adds considerable tactical depth to the entire game, forcing the player to carefully weigh the movements of the units and not to leave the key outposts unattended. The same goes for monoliths, magical artifacts which, if conquered, allow you to use different skills in battle, including elemental spells or boosts of your defenses. Even the battlefield itself, with its different types of terrain, offers numerous factors to always take into account when planning your strategy: mountain slopes slow down your advance, poisonous swamps weaken your units, while your opponents can hide in woods, ready to ambush you. Unfortunately, the plot borders on banality, limiting itself to giving a minimum context to the various missions. However, where the narration and game situations fail miserably, the funny jokes and the irresistible humor always hidden between the dialogues manage to make even the most cloying of characters charismatic. As we write, however, Highborn is unfortunately afflicted by a series of more or less sensational defects: there is a multiplayer mode, but it is based exclusively on Facebook Connect, making the game intrusive and not very immediate. Even more serious is the lack of a key that undoes the last action made, precluding the player the possibility of correcting an accidental movement. Fortunately, one can console oneself with the idea that the developers will soon correct these defects with an application update.
