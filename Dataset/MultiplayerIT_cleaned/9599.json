Today the baton has passed to the ~surly~ Daniel Craig, who in addition to cinema also finds himself dealing with the world of video games, which has always been devoted to the character created by Ian Fleming's pen. And so in the GoldenEye 007 remake we find his voice instead of Brosnan's, and it is only the first of a series of inevitable differences between the first person shooter developed by n-Space and the extraordinary one that was made in 1997 from Rare. The Orlando, Florida-based team is by no means new to the genre, having been curating handheld reductions of the Call of Duty series for the Nintendo console for three years already, and also dealt with the recent Call of Duty: Black Ops. It is therefore not surprising to find the exact same control system in GoldenEye, which by default uses the stylus for aiming, the d-pad for character movements and the L back button to open fire. The operations relating to reloading and changing the weapon, as well as interaction with the environment, are all present in the form of an icon on the touch screen, even if the touch response is sometimes not very immediate and can create difficulties, especially during the ambushes. However, an alternative control system has been inserted, in which the main buttons of the DS act as a second d-pad and move the crosshairs. Unfortunately, the results, in this case, leave something to be desired. Licence to kill In the fifteen stages that make up the story mode, GoldenEye 007 dispenses pure action sequences and stealth phases in a balanced way, in some cases giving us the freedom to choose the approach we prefer. We can therefore hit a guard on the head with the silenced pistol before he sees us or approach and kill him with our bare hands, and then continue silently towards our next victim; or we can take up the machine gun and unload entire magazines on the opponents, but trying to do it after having found some shelter. The management of vital energy is very similar to that of the original GoldenEye for Nintendo 64, therefore with two indicators that represent Bond's health and the other the level of the bulletproof vest, if we have it. However, there is an important difference: on the Nintendo DS, by taking cover and avoiding further damage, health regenerates after a few seconds. Some moments of the adventure are characterized by the presence of small minigames based on the touch screen, which in effect leave the time they find, but in general the experience proves to be solid and the lack of a real exploratory phase does not weigh much on the fun. The pointing system is greatly affected by the low graphic resolution, and in fact scoring a headshot is rather complicated. On the other hand, the enemies are really very resistant to bursts directed at the body, and on more than one occasion it will happen to run out of a magazine and find yourself in the task of having to replace it while we are being targeted. Once the adventure has been completed, which actually lasts a few hours, it is possible to try a series of multiplayer modes both locally and online, via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. From this point of view, an excellent job has been done. You can play all against all or form two teams for up to eight participants, within many different modes: ~Conflict~, the classic deathmatch; ~Golden Sun~, a variant based on finding an item; ~Flag Tag~, territorial mode in which you have to occupy a flag area to earn points; ~Capture the Flag~, which needs no introduction; ~King of the Hill~, similar to ~Flag Tag~ but with bases to conquer that change position during the match; ~Multihill~, a variant in which any base on the map can be conquered; ~Last Man Standing~, a deathmatch in which each player has only three lives. The multiplayer action takes place against the backdrop of eight scenarios and can be enriched by modifications that involve increasing or decreasing the resistance to hits. It's just a pity that finding a game online is very complicated, better to agree between friends. The technical comparison between the current GoldenEye 007 and the 1997 original sees the DS version prevail as regards the detail of the locations and the quality of the polygonal models, which however appear very angular. Sorry for the dancer frame rate, which really has nothing to do with the one seen on Nintendo 64 and which certainly makes the experience less precise and fun than it could have been.", "date": "2010-12-02", "grade": "7.4"}
