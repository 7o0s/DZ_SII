Beyond sensational situations such as that of Cloud Imperium's Star Citizen space simulator, able to collect the exorbitant sum of 53 million dollars and give new life to the genre to which it belongs, the most intrepid (and nostalgic ) have to work hard to catalyze interest in products considered niche, elbowing each other in the increasingly crowded crowdfunding campaigns. Among the more daring, some seek visibility away from the tumultuous shores of the best known sites - such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo - trying their luck, sometimes with positive results, on less prestigious but still valid stages. This is the case of Urban Games and its Train Fever, a business game dedicated to the world of transport which, within six months, managed to reach the required sum of 250,000 dollars on the Gambitius platform, after a period of difficulty and the lowering of the initial target of 50 thousand dollars. Spiritual heir to games like the old Sid Meier Railroad Tycoon (1990) and Transport Tycoon (1994), with some ingredients fished with both hands from the more recent Cities in Motion, the title, developed by five guys from Schaffausen (Switzerland), puts the player in the role of the management of a powerful transport company, whose purpose, from 1850 up to the present day, is to accompany the development of the economy and infrastructure of an entire region. Train Fever offers a management experience with potential but also a few too many flaws Exit the tunnel The first element of interest in Train Fever is its procedural nature, given that at the beginning of each new game it is possible to generate a random map by setting a few simple stakes: beyond the extension, which goes from small to large, you can in fact influencing the topography of the territory by regulating the number of plains and hills present; a fundamental aspect in the economy of the game since it is intimately connected with the effectiveness, the cost and the potential distribution of the railway and road networks. For the more daring it is also possible to create a map by entering a random alphanumeric code in the appropriate bar, obtaining always different - and shareable - results with each new game. Once the creation process is over, more or less long depending on the choices made, you are immediately projected into the game, where there is only an immature tutorial to support the player, dedicated to camera management and the basic construction of the transport lines. Being a management product, whose complexity increases with the passing of the hours and the introduction of new technologies, one is simply disoriented by the lack of information on the ~pieces~ available and their usefulness, above all as regards the commercial side. On the map, which can be zoomed in on any detail at will, some invented cities are positioned - in European style - where the inhabitants have a job, a fixed abode and places of leisure to frequent. To reach their destinations, at the beginning, they all move on foot: it's up to the player to build the first public transport networks by crafting bus and/or tram lines carefully. The procedure is quite simple in dynamics: after having placed the stops in the crucial points of a city, followed by the vehicle depot and the station, it is possible to create the first real line from the appropriate menu, which will give it a specific color easily identifiable from above. In the depot you can buy the first means of transport of the time, i.e. carriages with horses, which, once assigned to the desired line, begin their journey by picking up the first needy passengers, indicated by a yellow icon in the interface. The player doesn't have to worry about managing fares and the like, but only about guaranteeing a fast and efficient service, with an acceptable waiting margin for customers: this is possible through the construction of a second line or, even better, by purchasing more vehicles for the same route. The tramway network can also be built in the city, a process which naturally requires the installation of tracks and sometimes the transformation of the roadway, with more or less expensive intervention costs. Building efficient city networks is simple and immediately gives good satisfaction, given that one sees one's income grow rather quicklyHowever, the first real problems arise when we turn to the much more fascinating railway lines, capable of connecting the various cities to each other and significantly catalyzing the development and progress of our region. After having strategically placed two stations in as many cities, it is necessary to build the (expensive) tracks to join them, where the shape of the land plays a fundamental role in the success of the enterprise. Having to cross roads and rivers through bridges, dig tunnels in the mountains or, perhaps, lengthen the journey to avoid obstacles, in fact has an exorbitant cost, and very careful planning of the work is a must. To the intrinsic difficulty of the process, unfortunately, there are sometimes unexplained error messages that do not allow the connection of the line, forcing the equally costly destruction and reworking of entire sections. Once the basic network has been created, wagons and locomotives must obviously be purchased in the appropriate menu, finding the right balance between freight and passenger transport. Trains have a decidedly higher operating cost than buses and trams, and it is necessary to wait some time before seeing the first real profits. Unfortunately from the point of view of commercial exchanges there is no useful information in the tutorial, for example on the management of trucks or on interfacing with the industries that produce material, therefore one must proceed by trial and error and try to understand which is the most suitable solution; no big deal since from the beginning one has to plan for the future. The same goes for the signs to be placed on the tracks: not infrequently the trains can literally strand the lines blocking all traffic, consequently forcing the player to send them back to the depots and, sometimes, even to destroy entire sections due to problems that are not they could predict. Even the interface and the characters of the menus have some critical elements, given that they are far too small to read and often the clickable buttons are confused with simple text, without considering the useless cumbersomeness and complexity of some trivial procedures. Fortunately, the game is completely open to mods and several users are working to introduce new more understandable and usable graphical interfaces, as well as tutorials and strategy guides that explain in detail the various aspects of Train Fever. Another problem is represented by the fact that we are faced with a sandbox title without a real purpose, such as a rival company controlled by the CPU to overcome; simply you have to earn as much money as possible by creating (and maintaining) a modern and efficient transport network, improving the quality of the roads and replacing old vehicles with newer ones, which become available over the years. The only real satisfaction is given by the unlockable achievements and the possibility of starting a new game from 1900 or from 1950, instead of always starting from 1850 with the old basic means. The learning curve is therefore very high, and the inconvenient menus, completely in English, represent a further obstacle to the normal use of the product, which at the moment is recommended only to enthusiasts of the genre, even considering the not exactly popular price (about 25 Euros). . For all the others it is better to wait for the arrival of patches and mods that will soften the many edges. Grumpy trains From a purely technical point of view we are certainly not facing a Triple A production, however we cannot deny the good work done by the five guys from the Zurich Polytechnic, whose only real lack lies in the optimization of the graphics engine, which is far too heavy and capable of putting even high-end systems in difficulty - in the utmost detail. The cities are full of life and full of details, where it is possible to appreciate good quality textures and satisfactory filters even by zooming to the maximum with the camera. The animations of the pedestrians who populate the streets are discreet, while those of the horses of the first means of transport are a little grotesque and accelerated. Outside of the urban complexes, the map appears at times bare and poor, embellished only by a few small industrial areas, cultivated fields and stretches of water. After all, these areas will be completely distorted by the passage of the tracks and, probably, by the removal work that you will have to carry out all too often on the sections. The polygonal models of the various vehicles are good, faithful reproductions of those of the time also accompanied by some interesting information about their history and use; however, several modders are working to expand the already large basic rosteravailable to developers. From an audio point of view, we point out a discreet choice as regards the sound effects, well sampled, while the cheerful soundtrack is composed of some very catchy pieces, although it is a little out of context.", "date": "2014-09-22", "grade": "6.8"}
