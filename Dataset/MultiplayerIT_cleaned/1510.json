From a technical point of view it stands at good levels, with a discreet design of the stages and of all the elements found inside. Playing this game will make you relive the sensations felt in the movies, this is due to the perfect reproduction of the surrounding environments, where every single detail is inspired by Disney productions. The textures are good overall, without particular graphic refinements, but not with any defects whatsoever. The graphics engine manages everything in peace, during the game you will never encounter a drop in frame rate and the camera is always up to the situation, it will follow you with extreme precision. In case you want to better explore the environment around you, thanks to the right stick you can move the view, pressing it, the view will stop at the point you set. Like all skate board games, Disney Extreme Skate Adventure is all about playability. Well yes, mastering your character within these magnificent levels is a lot of fun, and although this title winks at a young audience, the characters in the game have an excellent amount of tricks that can be performed. The controls are comfortable and intuitive from the first game, getting familiar with the pad is not difficult at all. As you well know, all self-respecting skate board games have a number of unlockable extras out of the ordinary, well, get ready, during your raids in the levels you will have to sharpen your view, as the programmers have inserted some hidden areas which, for your joy, they will take you to areas of the levels full of very useful bonuses. If playing multiplayer is your passion, don't worry, Activision has thought of you too. In Disney Extreme Skate Adventure there is a two-player mode, in which the two participants compete against each other with tricks. Another fun mode is King Of The Hill, where the player who holds a crown for the longest time wins. The sound department of this game has been made with extreme care, as for the graphics, all the effects are taken from Disney films, and everything is accompanied by a respectable soundtrack. Among the artists that appear, Smash Mouth and Reel Big Fish deserve a mention. If the original songs of the game are not enough, feel free to implement your own soundtracks, since Disney Extreme Skate Adventure gives you this possibility. The game supports Dolby Digital, therefore, if you own a Dolby system you can enjoy the audio of the game in all its glory. As always, the bad news arrives. During the review the undeniable merits of this game were highlighted, however it is necessary to point out the aspects in which it is not convincing. Disney Extreme Skate Adventure has a good amount of missions and extras, but these two factors could make the game monotonous, enticing the player to limit himself to grind after grind. Another defect from which this title suffers is the poor replayability, it is difficult that, once one's tasks have been completed, one goes back to picking up the game. <i>Comment</i> Skate board games generally attract a small audience (if we exclude the series linked to Tony Hawk), usually passionate about this fun sport. At Activision they thought that, thanks to the Disney license, the game could appeal to a wider range of players. However, despite the good graphics, the excellent playability and the numerous missions to complete, Disney Extreme Skate Adventure risks getting boring before the end. The purchase is obviously recommended to anyone who has a child and wants to play with it together, fun for two is guaranteed, the others, unless they are die-hard Disney fans, can also avoid it. Pros: Officially licensed by Disney Fun in Multiplayer Cons: Lack of appeal for most Xbox users Risks of tiring too soon When Tony Hawk meets Buzz Lightyear The beauty of having a Disney license is that you can feel free to create any game that pops into your head, rest assured that something good will come out of it. This must have been the reasoning they did in Activision at the time of the production of Disney Extreme Skate Adventure, a game that features Disney characters in an attempt to imitate the great Tony Hawk in a crazy game of Skateboarding. The basic ideaof this game is not bad at all: what could be better than Disney characters to create a fun game? Disney Extreme Skate Adventure is an honest title, whose intent is to entertain a younger group of users than the Xbox target. The structure behind this title is the classic for games of this genre, the character controlled by you will wander through large levels in order to carry out certain missions. As was legitimate and obvious to expect, the stages present in Disney Extreme Skate Adventure are taken from the famous films of the American company, we will therefore have levels set in the world of Toy Story 2, The Lion King and Tarzan. Each main world is divided into several sub-levels, which concern very specific locations that appeared in the various films. The amount of characters available is definitely adequate to the standards of the genre, from the beginning, you can choose yours among twelve. But exactly, what is done in this game? As just said, your character must carry out missions, missions that will be assigned to you by characters you meet in the various levels. The ~typical mission~ that you will have to carry out will be to recover a certain number of letters to compose a word, or you will also happen to go in search of a lost object. Although you have missions to carry out, nobody prevents you from scampering around the level performing tricks at will. While on the one hand the excellent amount of missions to play can be considered as a plus, on the other it could be a negative factor, as it could make the game too boring and monotonous. In addition to the primary missions, you can also carry out secondary ones, such as collecting a certain number of objects. Each level has a certain number of missions to carry out, once you finish you need to move on to the next one. As in any self-respecting skate game, when you perform tricks you are awarded points, points that go to fill a bar which, once full, gives you the opportunity to perform a special trick.", "date": "2003-10-31", "grade": null}
