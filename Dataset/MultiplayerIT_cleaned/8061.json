Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a cent.Evidently not everything has been said yet in the inflated vein of endless runs with a three-quarter top view. Dominated by ~honest~ but not exceptional titles such as Temple Run and its recent spin-off based on the animated film ~Rebel - The Brave~, this genre has been best presented to us by freemium productions, see the excellent Subway Surfers (recently updated, however) and the post-apocalyptic interpretation of The End. Run'n'Gun therefore tries to do just as well, putting us in the shoes of a character who suddenly finds himself having to chase down some orcs who have stolen a few bags of gold coins. Within a fantasy scenario, our alter ego will not only embark on an endless run following the traditional rules of running games (gesture upwards on the touch screen to jump, downwards to slide, left or right to change direction at an intersection), but will have to change ~lane~ (by tilting the device) according to his offensive capabilities, i.e. staying on the same trajectory as the enemy in order to shoot at him. Each successful hit corresponds to a coin that the ogre loses along the way, therefore hitting one's targets represents the best way to get rich in the game, even and above all when huge trolls burst onto the scene that we can knock down (conquering their treasures) only if we manage to hit them for the necessary time, preferably after improving our fire ratio through a convenient upgrade system. Too fast? For the experience offered by an endless run to be enjoyable, the speed of the action must not increase too quickly, and the player must have a period of ~adaptation~ before increasing the degree of difficulty. If the two episodes of Temple Run have a flaw, it is precisely this, that is, they mask with excessive ~haste~ a structure that has very little to say, whereas in the aforementioned Subway Surfers there is much more gradualness and the gain is certainly the fun . Run'n'Gun is placed halfway between these two examples, that is, it offers us a relatively calm and accessible first phase of the game, in which one has plenty of time to ~get into the part~ and collect some gold coins, for then increase the speed substantially. Which wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't a general repetitiveness of the solutions, with double (if not triple) obstacles positioned exactly after a change of direction, in a rather unpleasant way; but above all a responsiveness of the controls not always up to the situation: it is not uncommon to crash into a wall because the game has not correctly understood our touches, even if large. We therefore hope for the arrival of an update that solves the problem, because otherwise Gaijin Entertainment has packaged a decidedly beautiful product, characterized by excellent graphics in terms of characters, scenarios and frame rate fluidity, as well as convincing sound effects ( shame about the music, nice but too repetitive).", "date": "2013-01-12", "grade": "7.8"}
