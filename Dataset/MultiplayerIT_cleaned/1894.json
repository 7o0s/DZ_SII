{"name": "Hitman 2: Silent Assassin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hitman-2-silent-assassin.html", "text": "My name is 47. Number 47. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, narratively, starts where the first episode left off. Following the events that took place in the prequel, 47 (the bald protagonist of the game, a professional assassin for a mysterious agency) loses track of himself and finds refuge in a church in Sicily, intent on redeeming himself from his violent past. Unfortunately, the quiet ascetic existence of 47, who in the meantime had devoted himself to gardening, is cut short by an event that will see him forced to return to his original job. The priest of the church that hosted him is in fact kidnapped by mobsters, and poor 47 has no choice but to rely on the agency to track him down: but since nothing in the world is free, in exchange for information about the priest, our hero he will be forced to carry out missions around the world again for his old employers. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is, as the subtitle suggests, a real ~assassin simulator~ that places great emphasis on the stealth component of the action: completing a mission in a ~clean~ way, without setting off any alarms or alerting anyone guard is in fact exponentially more rewarding than an unscrupulous and noisy attitude a la first-person-shooter, although the Eidos title leaves the player the freedom to choose the way he prefers to achieve his goals. Decision-making freedom allowed not only by the possibility of choosing a first or third person view at any time, but above all by the open game scheme that makes Hitman 2 a decidedly interesting title. The arsenal made available to the user allows carnage worthy of Soldier of Fortune, but at the same time the possibility of killing the guards silently, wearing their clothes and hiding their corpse, as well as the presence of numerous useful objects such as diversions opens the way to a markedly stealth approach. It must also be said that in addition to the attitude with which to face the missions, Hitman 2 also leaves the player with the choice of how to complete their objectives. For example, in a mission it is required to kill two Russian officers during their meeting in a park: well, it is possible to climb the bell tower of a church and kill them both with a sniper rifle, or to place two bombs in their respective cars, or still waiting for them to leave in the vehicles to be able to ambush them. Of course, you can also choose to adopt a mix of the options listed above I'm the best at what I do, and what I do is not good. One of the biggest flaws of Hitman: Codename 47 was the often maddening level of difficulty, accentuated by the impossibility of saving during missions. Fortunately, Silent Assassin remedies this drawback, making 7 saves available to the user for each mission, which can be used at any time. As far as the conversion on PS2 is concerned, the work done by Io Interactive is decidedly commendable: the control system is precise and functional, although not very agile, and the graphic design is of undoubted quality. The game settings of Hitman 2 are always very accurate and detailed, in a decidedly successful search for realism; the light effects and most of the textures are also excellent, while some animations appear too woody and not very fluid. In general, however, the visual sector of the Eidos title is of sure impact, also thanks to the remarkable interactivity (and destructibility) of the elements of the scenario and to the algorithm that manages the movements of the bodies, which collapse, roll and are dragged with great likelihood of reality. The sound sector is also excellent, thanks to a high quality English dubbing and very well done effects and music. But although undoubtedly cared for in every aspect, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin fails to reach levels of excellence mainly due to a palpable underlying repetitiveness of the action; although in fact the missions are set in very different scenarios, it is difficult not to notice how in almost each of them it is necessary to repeat the same scheme of disguise-killing the objective-escape. Of course, in some situations one is called to carry out one's job in a different way, but these still remain exceptions within a not exactly excellent mission design. Conclusions Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a good title, with attention to every aspect, which however fails to guarantee a gaming experience withcontinually enthralling, often resulting in a veiled monotony that prevents the Eidos product from becoming a real must-buy. And it's a shame, because in addition to being technically flawless, Hitman 2 presents an interesting narrative plot and a series of decidedly original and captivating gimmicks. Although it is not a masterpiece, therefore, Hitman 2 is still a game that fans of the genre should take into consideration, also considering the scarcity of similar quality titles. Pros: Technically commendable Many game solutions Above average for the genre Cons: Some basic repetitiveness Given the good reception from critics and the public, it was easy to predict that Hitman: Codename 47 would be followed by an inevitable number two, perhaps extended to other platforms in addition to the PC. This sequel, subtitled Silent Assassin, has certainly not disappointed expectations in this respect, paying homage to all the latest generation gaming machines with its presence. With all due respect to action / adventure lovers.", "date": "2002-12-04", "grade": null}
