The possibilities are few: either you do better, and then you enter Olympus, or you do worse, even slightly, and you risk being quickly forgotten. Developed by Wargaming.net, those of Massive Assault, and distributed by Square Enix (since you know them) Order of War attempts to reconstruct some of the most important military operations of the Second World War by peppering them with the usual winning rhetoric that never hurts (so they say, but don't trust them): Operation Overlord on the side of the Americans and the Bagration operation on the side of the Germans. The start is promising with menus created in a professional way and an evident care in the iconographic reconstruction of those fateful years, practically only the propaganda broadcasts are missing, also throwing an eye on highly popular titles such as Call of Duty for the creation of some contour elements. Mission briefings are comprehensive and detailed, leaving little to chance or the imagination. The first mission of the Yankee campaign requires the capture of some key areas of the map. Trivially, one could think of a happy walk since we are in the tutorial mission, however things get challenging right away with the enemies who are not there to act as puppets for us and return fire with an unprecedented verve. In reality we will soon discover that the situation is better than it seems and that the difficulty is calibrated thinking about the average challenge offered by titles of this genre. Strategist The control system is the classic real-time strategy one and those who are already weaned with the genre will not find many difficulties in understanding how to move the troops and make them act. In particular, Order of War forces you to select entire battalions looking for a realism dear to a certain branch of users, but without giving up an underlying agility that does not disturb less experienced players. Soon, from a few men, we pass to control entire armies structured in a more complex way and with various types of means available (there is also the famous landing on the famous beach that we promised ourselves not to mention in the article). From small raids we move on to conducting large-scale maneuvers where the game gives its best showing a good strategic depth. Too bad that the developers have not avoided making the piles of troops effective and therefore, in many situations, it will be enough to accumulate enough to defeat the enemies without thinking too much about how to act. As tradition dictates, each unit has its strengths and weaknesses, which makes it optimal to use on certain occasions, but cannon fodder on others. It takes little to understand how the system works and to take the necessary countermoves (don't expect to stop an armored car with a knife, of course) also by virtue of a series of advice that is given before and during the missions. The sense of duty Order of War is graphically well done but does not leave you crying out for a miracle, with detailed troops and well-constructed scenarios, but also with a certain background flatness that leaves you a little chilly, above all due to some textures that are not exactly state of the art . In general, we note the chronic lack of touches of class and a certain dryness in the realization that has aimed to obtain a good result, but without racking too much brain to do better. From the point of view of the soundtrack, however, expect the usual series of battlefield effects and the equally usual military tunes. Everything is therefore done properly, but it is undeniable that the general flavor is that of a well-known dish. It is also true that it is difficult to overturn a series of cultural canons well rooted in the masses without exposing oneself to criticism in this sense. Throw the stone and... The greatest value of Order of War, which is also the element that exposes it most to criticism, is its continuous withdrawal to try to make room for the largest possible audience. It is easy to see that this is an ambitious title from a strategic point of view, but it is equally evident that some simplifications have been a bit forced making it affordable, but perhaps too difficult for neophytes, who require a greater effort to tame it, and too simple for seasoned strategists, who will not take long to complete the campaigns. For heaven's sake, yeshe is a substantially well-made product that manages to give excellent gaming moments, it only adds little to the general picture and gets lost in an anonymity that could have been avoided by making more radical choices in terms of game mechanics.", "date": "2009-10-07", "grade": "7.5"}
