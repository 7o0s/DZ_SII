Leaning on the solid foundations formed by a vast and accurate setting and typically role-playing game mechanics, therefore well suited to long times of use, Bethesda has well thought of not archiving the mighty game world created: on the other hand, once removed the ending with the Broken Steel expansion and increased the ~level cap~ by 10 levels, what was the point of ending the contribution of new content? The numbers speak for themselves, the public has shown that they appreciate the rhythmic injections of gameplay through the DLCs released so far (characterized by alternating quality levels, to tell the truth) and the opening of the game world on its part does everything so as not to make downloadable additions inconsistent. Market logic does the rest. So here we are at the first expansion of a new series, after the first three packages promised by Bethesda: Point Lookout. The usual fundamental dilemma promptly reappears once it has been brought to trial: how can one evaluate a fragment of what is almost unanimously recognized as a masterpiece? The answer is not obvious however, since we have seen how the DLC formula actually tends to clash with what is the main feature of the RPG in question: the opening of the world and the great variety of contents offered. Small fragments made up of handfuls of hours of gameplay are in direct contrast to the fundamental philosophy of Fallout 3, which appeared very evident in Operation Anchorage and present, albeit somewhat mitigated, in the next two expansions. Point Lookout however, seems to want to focus more on exploration and environmental characterization, managing to stand out among all the DLC released so far for the Bethesda RPG. Adventures and moral choices in the swamp To begin with, the obvious QA issues that led to the frequent bugs and assorted glitches in previous expansions appear to have been resolved - from a 'code' point of view, everything seems to have gone smoothly and we acknowledge that. The attack of the story is similar to that seen in the other expansions: once the package is downloaded, we are reached by a mysterious radio frequency which informs us of the presence of a certain Captain Tobar, able to transport us to a new area dedicated to adventurers and hunters of treasures. Obviously, there is nothing pleasant about what awaits us at the end of the nice ferry in the company of Tobar: radiation has changed the natural environment, transfiguring a quiet coastal area into a post-atomic nightmare. Here we will find ourselves following a main story and several secondary adventures that follow the characteristic structure of Fallout 3 in a small way: as regards extension, quantity of quests and variety of situations, Point Lookout is a sort of micro-cosm that faithfully replicates the spirit of the original contaminated area. A mother looking for her daughter opens up the whirlwind of possible actions on the peninsula: wandering around you can come across the colorful local fauna, with inhabitants who will show themselves angrily hostile or eager to communicate their problems, triggering further adventures. From Resident Evil to ~The Hills Have Eyes~, it is easy to come across quotations and horror clichs, fighting aberrant figures or helping the needy, within the approximately 4 hours of gameplay required to ~scratch~ the new adventures proposed. The typical Fallout 3 dichotomy is also presented here: we can glimpse the two different fundamental solutions that can be reached by following the various quests, which once again bring out the different levels of reading the narrative plot. Xbox 360 goals Point Lookout doesn't represent a huge point boost to gamerscore, adding only 100 gamerpoints to the game's base loot, spread across 4 unlockable achievements. All the achievements in question are linked to quests to be completed, so their achievement is not a big problem for the player intending to complete the expansion. Good old tainted southeast The undoubted effort made by the developers in the characterization of the various expansions - from the cliffs of Anchorage to the incandescent vapors of The Pitt there was a way to see decidedly different graphic elements from those to which the main game has accustomed us - here achieves exciting results, making the setting the real highlight of Point Lookout. The promise of a new and rich land washed by the sea obviously hides just another piece of devastated and contaminated nightmare, a bitter truth which on the other hand appears clear from the first apparition of Tobar, who, like Charon, takes us to the substantial addition to the normal game map. The Point Lookout peninsula is about a fifth of the size of the entire wasteland, so it is clearly the largest expansion released so far for Fallout 3, however, characterized in a unique way: the swampy coasts overlook a dark sea and waterways very uninviting, while in the interior the suffocating humidity fills the thick vegetation with fog. Here and there you can still glimpse the ruins of an ancient and charming past, among steamboats, colonial-style houses, lighthouses and churches: dilapidated testimonies of a distant civilization that give way to the aberrant mutations that now dominate the area. The expert player will find bread for his teeth: the new creatures present in the swamps are challenging and put even those who have already reached the brand new level 30 in difficulty, making this an adventure probably more suitable for those who have already completed the game and at least also Broken Steel.", "date": "2009-07-01", "grade": "8.3"}
