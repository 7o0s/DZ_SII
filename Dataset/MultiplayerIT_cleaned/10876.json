{"name": "Time Crisis Strike", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/time-crisis-strike.html", "text": "Namco Bandai didn't exactly start their iPhone adventure on the right foot, releasing a couple of modest conversions of old classics and the infamous I Love Katamari, which came out with so many flaws that it was essentially unplayable. Time Crisis Strike would have been the perfect opportunity for a ransom, but we can already predict how the Japanese developer has not made the most of this chance. To begin with, the product lacks any form of plot: there is no introductory movie, nor textual indications that make the user understand the reason for the shootings in which he takes part, and the levels are not connected by any narrative device. Not that the storyline is a fundamental element for a shooter of this type, but the impression is that Namco has not had the slightest desire to embellish its title with some due element. Having said that, Time Crisis Strike is divided between three main modes (Arcade, Trial of a phase and Crisis missions), all characterized by the need to shoot the enemies that appear in front of us by tapping the touchscreen with your finger, while the movement takes place in automatic. The first is the simple succession of the three game levels, the second allows you to tackle them individually, while the third offers five special stages with specific objectives (hit only a certain type of enemy, conclude with a certain number of bullets, and so on). The playful offer of Time Crisis Strike would be satisfactory on paper, a pity that the very short duration of each section of which the product is composed irreparably undermines its global value. Completing the Arcade mode doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes, while the Crisis Missions don't last more than 60 seconds each: considering how there are no extras to unlock, it is clear that the Namco Bandai work presents a really too much dish poor to justify its - albeit low - selling price. Even if the short duration is not the only defect from which Time Crisis Strike suffers: some criticism should also be leveled at the system adopted to take cover (an indispensable procedure both for dodging enemy blows and for reloading one's weapon), which requires you to tilt iPhone angled too far, preventing you from seeing the screen well and avoiding threats quickly. Graphically, on the other hand, the work done by the developers appears more than good: completely polygonal, the game can count on quite extensive and detailed environments, and a considerable amount of enemies on the screen at the same time, all animated in a convincing way . The only flaw in this sense is a frame rate that is not exactly very fluid, but a convincing technical component is not enough to make Time Crisis Strike a worthy exponent of the series. PRO Graphically valid Fast-paced and fun... AGAINST ...but for a very short time Non-existent extra content Inadequate control system", "date": "2009-02-16", "grade": "S.V."}
