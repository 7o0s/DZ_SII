The great title, or at least an exponent of the genre, capable of fully satisfying the expectations of its millions of users, has always been missing since its release on the market. Square Enix's Final Fantasy XIII itself ended up creating mixed emotions for a large part of the user in question (and not only that), and now the hopes of fans of the genre are entrusted to Tales of Xillia, Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Rune Factory: Tides of Destiny. While waiting for these products, however, there is no shortage of 'palliatives', games that may not be excellent from a technical point of view, but which are good enough, or considered so, to somewhat satiate the public's hunger for Japanese-style role-playing games Western: in this sense, a couple of titles by the group Nippon Ichi, NIS, Compile Heart or Idea Factory come to mind, such as Hyperdimension Neptunia, or Atelier Rorona: The Alchemist of Arlan by Gust. Or even the game we are about to review, which, to tell the truth, we believe is the best of all the titles just mentioned. We are referring to White Knight Chronicles II, an exclusive PlayStation 3 created by the types of Level 5, those of Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King for Playtation 2, and also authors of the first White Knight Chronicles. The latter is among other things available, and therefore playable, within the Blu-Ray that is found in the sales package of its sequel. As if that weren't enough, the development team has implemented a function that allows you to import the saves from the first to the second chapter. When starting White Knight Chronicles II, in fact, you can choose whether to load an old save (with old stats and avatars) or start from level 35 with a party (and avatar) created at the moment. In this last case it is possible to redistribute the experience points and the various skills among the characters, in case the choices made by the AI in terms of distribution should not satisfy the user. White Knight Chronicles II The plot resumes immediately after the end of the first episode, with a short film summarizing the events of White Knight Chronicles. To be exact, we are about a year away from the events that led to the release of Princess Cisna and the defeat of the evil Grazel. The brave Leonard and his allies have returned to Balandor to live there in peace and harmony. Without spoiling too much, let's say immediately that their intentions will soon have to face a different reality, since Grazel is alive, and strong in the power of the Incorruptus, from the Island of the Red Horn proclaims himself King of the revived empire of Yshrenia, declaring war on the whole world, wreaking havoc and divisions between the various kingdoms. Once you start getting to the heart of the game, you immediately notice how White Knight Chronicles II has a structure practically identical to its predecessor. Menus, commands, to-do's and even the graphics are almost the same. In fact, the gameplay includes everything that is usually done in a classic role-playing game with a third person view (including the first chapter): following the indications given by the plot, which even offers narrative links to the PSP episode entitled White Knight Chronicles: Origins, you have to explore cities, dungeons and outdoor areas, talk to the inhabitants of the kingdom, fight hordes of enemies to eliminate them and gain experience points, level-ups and anything else you need to become stronger as you acquire them new weapons and abilities (which are more present in this sequel than in the first episode). The thing that differentiates this production from the others is the battle-system, which implements a system based halfway between a classic J-RPG and an MMORPG, and the online one, which we will analyze later. Playstation 3 trophies There are twenty-five Trophies available in White Knight Chronicles II. These are divided into 10 Bronze, 6 Silver, 8 Gold and 1 Platinum respectively. To obtain them it will be necessary to satisfy the requests of the game, which will then reward the player based on how much money he has spent, the missions completed or the number of pieces recovered of certain objects. For example, completing 100 quests with an S rank or collecting 50 rare fragments of equipment will give you Gold Trophies, but if you collect about half of them, you will get a Silver reward. Mixed fights Even the combat system is not very different from the one in the first chapter. Even if a deeper analysis and after several hours of play and battles we can say, indeed,that the battle system is actually more dynamic and better manageable than in the previous episode, even though, we reiterate it, with completely similar mechanics, apart from the tweaks for the introduction of the race for the Knights. Enemies are still visible on the screen and come in various types, from those who have a neutral attitude to others who attack on sight. Once you come into contact with them, the fight begins. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, it takes place in real time as regards the actions performed by the characters, but is regulated by turns and by Action Points: the player finds himself in control of the main character, while the other elements that make up the party are managed by the CPU. However, their actions can be configured by the user, who can give them the type of attitude that they will have to maintain for the entire duration of the fight: in this way the partner is ordered to give priority to one action rather than another , ~telling~ him to heal the party when it reaches a general low level of vital energy or to position himself in defense if attacked with certain magical elements, just to name a couple of examples. The actions of the hero operated by the user are determined by a circular time bar which indicates the moment in which it is possible for him to act. The indicator, when it is full, allows him to perform an attack in relation to the equipped weapon and the level of experience reached. These elements, together with spells, special abilities, objects, etc. can be recalled in battle via the bar divided into slots at the bottom of the screen, where the relative commands are housed. In this horizontal menu, in fact, the actions that the character can perform are grouped together, all accessible via the D-Pad, and back keys to scroll the pages. These actions can be configured between fights or even in the middle of battle. And personalized. Like the combos, which through the appropriate space can be created by connecting different attacks in a usable strip at the price of a certain number of Action Points, which can be earned simply by procuring and taking damage. Strategy and planning Again through the accumulation of these APs, the character can transform, for a certain amount of time, into the Incorruptus, the gigantic knight that users of the series have come to know. At this juncture the player can control a formidable creature, strong and grim enough to stand up to any monster, even the biggest. At the end of each action, it will be necessary to wait for the aforementioned circular time bar to be full again in order to be able to make another move. Therefore, apart from moving freely around the screen trying to avoid the blows of the opponents, which is rather difficult given that absurdly their attacks still reach the character guided by the user even when these should theoretically be out of their reach, one cannot do something else. At the end of each fight and after defeating enemies, players get the classic chance rewards. Some of these are found in both story and online modes, others only in the second and are used to upgrade weapons, items and equipment. With the recovery of the right materials, you can create new parts from scratch or even enhance those already equipped with magical effects. Furthermore, by spending the skill points earned, you can work on the characteristics of the characters and make them level up, to unlock new characteristics. In addition to the single player campaign there is a separate section called GeoNet, already present in the first episode of White Knight, which is accessible from any save point, provided however that you are connected to the PlayStation Network while playing. This is the online option of the game and the network created by Level 5 from which it is possible to do practically everything: create your own personal profile, chat, manage friend lists, face cooperative missions with other players or communicate with them by exchanging photos and messages, like in a real social networking service. Build your city Still on the subject of online, one of the options most loved by the author of this article and by fans in general returns, namely the Georama. This session allows users to create their own village/lobby, customizing every aspect of it, from houses to shops, from the terrain to the type of characters that will populate it. These can be recruited from any of the cities featured in the normal adventure and will retain their skills and duties in the web village as well. In short, who by professionhe is a shopkeeper in offline mode, for example, he will also do it in Georama. Also in this session, as happened in the previous chapter, the newly created city can host the presence of other human users (with their respective avatars) and five of them (in White Knight Chronicles there were only three) can join with the host gamer's character to form a party with which to go on sub-quests, maintaining among other things the same statistics of your character achieved in single player mode, including level and equipment. If you don't have friends to play with, simply select a mission from a list and the game searches for the first available party to join. Then communicating via text or voice chat. Compared to its predecessor, White Knight Chronicles II allows users to be able to transform themselves into a knight even on the web, customizing the armor and characteristics of their knight, and to face dozens of new quests. Finally, it should be noted that all the DLC of the first White Knight always related to the Georama can also be transferred to the new one. We conclude by taking a look at the graphic and audio aspects of the product. In the first case we have practically the same engine of the first chapter to manage the aesthetic part, with very similar characters and scenarios, apart from high definition, to those of the PlayStation 2 games. Even if there are some small adjustments here and there, a cure of details and a variety of environments and monsters such as to make the visual whole more pleasant. In particular, then, the lights and some effects related to water are really well done. As for the soundtrack, we have an English dubbing (with Italian subtitles) of decent workmanship, forcings aside for some voices, and a soundtrack well integrated into the narrative context it wants to represent, with a new theme for the battles.", "date": "2011-07-01", "grade": "7.8"}
