There is no box and not even a manual: the game can only be downloaded from Steam at the price of 4.99 euros. Even the branding of any software house is absent. In its place, we read the author's name: Erik Svedng. He conceived and developed Blueberry Garden, and always he (who is also a musician, and plays in the band Kloss) chose ~Et Apres~ by the composer Daduk as the soundtrack of his game. There are no marketing strategies or external impositions. Blueberry Garden is an experimental video game, defined in every respect by the personality and talent of its creator. In this sense, Blueberry Garden is an ~arthouse video game~. Once the context is defined, let's start the game. The atmosphere is that of an old silent film, sweet and melancholy. There is an open tap, and we don't know if this is the big one or the main character is small. The sense of proportion changes with the changing point of view, as in dreams. Whether real or imaginary, the pouring water threatens to submerge the garden where we are. We must therefore touch the giant objects scattered in the setting (here the deceptive proportions return), and stack them on top of each other until they reach the height of the tap, so that we can close it once and for all. Only then can we focus on the second goal: reaching the moon. Curiosity In addition to the ~Best Innovation~ award received at the 2008 Swedish Game Awards, Blueberry Garden was awarded the prestigious ~Seamus McNally Grand Prize~ at the Independent Games Festival held this year at the Game Developers Convention in San Francisco. The cuckold's blueberry garden explorations, vaguely reminiscent in style of Norwegian cartoonist Jason's characters, were applauded by the festival judging panel who recognized Blueberry Garden as: ~A brilliant game concept crafted with precision and beautifully presented It intertwines graphics, sound and gameplay and evokes the feeling that the game world is truly alive.~ Removed the superfluous, the truth lights up Why the moon? We do not know. It is an elegant touch of the author, his invention. There are two phases of the game that are united by the language of emotion rather than logic, and we accept them without explanation. After all, Blueberry Garden is a dream video game. Suffice it to say that by pressing the ~home~ key, the screen blurs, and we appear at the beginning of the garden, in front of a door cut out in the white background of the screen. The same happens when touching objects. However, recovering them is not immediate and to do so we have to rely on the fruits that grow in the garden. By eating them we obtain different effects, such as being able to breathe underwater. In some cases, we have to pick the right fruit and transport it to another place. You never die, and there are no enemies; there are only bizarre creatures that can eat the seeds we have planted, and that we must therefore keep at a distance. That's it, but it's not a little: it's the exact size. The graphics are in fact reduced to its essential lines, sufficient to characterize a style whose influences can be recognized, but which nonetheless remains original. The gameplay has the necessary controls to get us up without falling along the learning curve of the game, but forgoes the unnecessary stunts. And then there's the soundtrack, a bittersweet melody composed for the piano. We are thrilled to know that it was composed by Daduk at different times, without a video game in mind, and that it then found its home in Erik Svedng's creation. Like a meeting of soul mates. We therefore recommend that you play Blueberry Garden leaving aside preconceptions, and with the state of mind of someone who is capable of being amazed. Interview with Erik Svedng Multiplayer.it: So, let's talk about you. I don't mean just your life as a developer, but your own life story, Erik's life, so it's up to you how you want to present yourself. Erik Svedang: I was born in 1986 in the city of Uppsala, where my parents studied biology. When I was four we moved to a small house in the countryside where I grew up with two younger sisters and a brother. I spent most of my time playing with Lego, building tree houses, drawing maps for rather complex board games, and so on. With my friends I spent a lot of time playing and producing music, both with different musical instruments and on the computer. When I turned twelve I moved again with my family to the west coast of Sweden. I wasn't very happy with the matter to tell the truth, but in the end I found myself bene, I felt at home over there. I like the sea very much. The summer I was about to turn sixteen, I started making short films with my friends, and with my sisters and brothers. I was obsessed with becoming a director and shot a huge number of shorts over the course of three years. I put a lot of effort into making our shorts look like they were the 'real', professional ones, but it wasn't easy given the cheap and poor quality equipment we had at our disposal. I'm definitely proud of that production though, but unfortunately I've never been able to shoot a script about my being a rather miserable teenager, too bad because now I'd gladly see a short like that! When I turned eighteen I started Game Design Education, and I graduated last spring.M.it: We are enjoying your story. Go Go. E.S.: In retrospect, my childhood seems like a long apprenticeship to being able to express myself, and Blueberry Garden is one of my first creative works that is not based entirely on just preparing and developing one's skills, but is instead the effort to communicate something to people. It's a great feeling, because it means I can use the things I've learned, something you start to doubt you can do after more than fifteen years in school, instead of looking for gratification in appearing trying to show everyone what you've done . M.it: What we really appreciated about the game is that elusive that is perceived, capable of making one feel astonished. It goes far beyond assembling design choices, and so we should talk about it - and the garden ends up breathing, even becoming interminable. That's why we continually end up returning to it, we like to stress the shape of that world at will, explore it, and often, we forget about the faucet or the moon. E.S.: Interesting idea. I was thinking, about communicating... with Blueberry it's more about capturing a certain feeling - the bittersweet of beauty? A paradise with a disaster about to happen? It's hard to find the words... and then, the joy of exploring. And the wonder of the magical events that occur. The game is certainly about what goes through the player's head while doing ~things~ about the world in which the game takes place.M.it: Ken Levine, creator of BioShock, once said that some video games are like a movie where the player is called upon to play the part of the protagonist, only that he has never read or knows anything about the script. What do you think? E.S.: Regarding the ~player as actor~ I'm not sure I know exactly what to think. I have experimented with Blueberry Garden but I don't think I have been successful and the thing has succeeded. Player motivation is a really complex thing and is probably a combination of a number of factors. Single players are somewhat difficult. In a way it is strange that as humans we find it fulfilling and enjoyable to sit all day, often on our own, moving through trials, getting through them even with no one to witness our success, being impressed by our actions. I think I'm becoming much more aware of the fact that people have their experiences in different ways, unique to each player, while playing and so if it's a meaningful experience for them then that's good design too. M.it : Can we know more about this blueberry garden? E.S.: I see water as a metaphor for anything dangerous, and the only way to escape is to think. Brainstorm. And everyone else who lives in this world is just a madman, who greedily chews the precious fruits while you are alone with yourself, let's say, and they don't even thank you because they can't even utter a word! I tried to make things mean something by themselves, like there really is this world as it is, drowning and so on. This has a really concrete meaning. And I want people to have their own idea of what it means and the elements that make it up, and not what it means to me or ~the moral~. Yes, it certainly is a quest for knowledge, both from a gameplay point of view and from a ~story~ point of view. M.it: Thank you Erik. E.S.: Thank you for the nice conversation!", "date": "2009-07-02", "grade": "9.0"}
