And this thanks in particular to a unique style and a gameplay capable of mixing, and well, the frenzy of first person shooters with some role-playing game mechanics and other takes from the world of MMOs. All embellished by a plot full of jokes and funny situations, which took place five years after the events of Borderlands. Almost two years later, the game finally arrives on PlayStation Vita by Iron Galaxy, with six additional packs previously released separately for home consoles, such as Captain Scarlett and his pirate loot, Campaign of the Massacre of Mr Torgue and the characters of Gaige the Mechromancer and Krieg the Psycho, support for cross-save with PlayStation 3, and many expectations. The latter, let's face it right away, have in part been disregarded, even if to be honest it must be said that all in all the porting is not as bad as it might seem at first glance. But enough talk and let's see together how this portable version of Borderlands 2 is. The game tells of the boss of the multinational Hyperion Corporation, Handsome Jack, who subdued Pandora with the construction of a huge satellite in front of the stationary moon, and of the birth of the myth of a second Crypt present on the planet which has attracted many hunters to its surface, anxious to find out if this time they will find a treasure or a very powerful enemy inside it, as in the first episode. In the role of a new Vault Hunter, the player will experience an adventure in which he will have to watch his back even from the aforementioned multinational, which has put a price on his head. Borderlands 2 arrives on PlayStation Vita loaded with content and expectations A mix of genres Once the game is loaded, the first thing to do is create the character to play. This is done by selecting one of the available models, then modifying a couple of aesthetic elements and giving it one of the six basic classes, including the two later added as downloadable content, namely the Mechromante, capable of summoning a powerful robot called Deathtrap, and the Psycho. Each of them is characterized by a unique primary ability, plus a series of secondary ones that are divided into three branches in which to channel the points earned by leveling up, in order to allow users to be able to customize the type of path they want for the upgrade of the character. It is also possible to increase the variety also by finding new objects among the loot that is obtained by carrying out missions, as we will see later. During this phase, however, one of the most important defects of the production immediately catches the eye, namely the presence of menus and texts that are difficult to understand, which makes it difficult to read what appears on the video. In fact it is clear that the game interface has simply been taken from the original PlayStation 3, but not adapted to be used properly on the small screen of PlayStation Vita. In any case, proceeding with our analysis, once you have made your choices you can start playing the campaign. Pandora is divided into a series of large maps within which the main missions that carry on the plot take place, and other secondary ones that favor exploration. Exploring the planet, characters and enemies of different natures come across, ranging from ~simple~ marauders to organized gangs, up to mechanical creatures and ferocious animals. In this sense, two of the most important aspects of the gameplay of Borderlands 2 are the secondary quests and the search and collection of loot, as it is precisely in the alternative missions that you can often get better rewards than those found in the chests or on enemies. The only limitation of these quests is that in the long run some can prove to be a little repetitive, even if the developers have made an effort to try to vary the tasks to be performed as much as possible. However the objectives are assigned by non-player characters or by the classic message boards. Even if the growth of the characteristics of the character takes place by leveling up and is managed automatically, with the only exception of the skills that must be assigned manually, to improve the performance of the protagonist, as we mentioned before, it can be useful to complete the various quests . In this way it is possible to recover modules that give bonuses based on the selected class, objects that serve to enhance shields or more effective weapons capable of influencing, once equipped, elements such as the stability of the same or on the type of danno extra they manage to inflict, just to give some examples. Without forgetting the Badass Ranking, which provides bonuses for completing certain game objectives, such as hitting enemies on the head a specific number of times and so on. The main feature of the aforementioned vouchers is that they are fixed, therefore they remain on all the characters created in such a way that, after reaching the level cap with one, if you want to start the game again with another, you will immediately end up with all the bonuses available. PSVita trophies Borderlands 2 on PlayStation Vita has the same trophies with the PlayStation 3 version: those who have the game for both platforms can therefore share those already unlocked. Otherwise, he must instead satisfy a series of demands of the game of increasing difficulty in all modes. These are linked to various factors, such as the completion of a certain number of side quests, the elimination of a particular enemy or the finding of some rare object. Shootings and slowdowns The other basic element of the Borderlands 2 gameplay is obviously the one related to the shootings and clashes against dozens of enemies. The response of the controls in these cases is quite good, but the title seems to suffer from some limitations regarding the mapping of the commands compared to the home counterpart. Unfortunately, the control system sins in spite of its lack of practicality and a certain intrinsic difficulty in being managed in a simple way, at least for those who are not used to juggling with the rear touch pad, levers and so on. The movements and the aim are in fact controlled with the two small analogs of PlayStation Vita, while with the touch on the back the run or the melee attack are activated depending on the side, and with the other tactiles the launch of the grenades, therefore the everything can turn out to be quite awkward, especially when managing characters with certain classes or when facing enemies that are rather quick in lateral movements, or that have particularly valid attack patterns, as in the case of bosses, who generally offer a good challenge since to shoot them down you can't limit yourself to shooting like madmen. If desired, the commands can be reassigned as desired by the gamer, but the substance changes little: the Sony portable console has fewer keys than would be needed to allow the user to play with a certain ease, avoiding some problems in the most agitated phases of the game. adventure. Moments where, among other things, we already have to deal with mysterious and continuous crashes, and with a low frame-rate which, while not compromising playability completely, jars and annoys in several areas, especially in a game that makes speed and of frenzy one of his warhorses. The title rarely reaches and maintains 30fps in a stable manner, and indeed in many circumstances it slows down dramatically. And this despite the fact that the developers have at least here tried to weigh down the engine as little as possible with some technical tricks, for example showing fewer opponents on the screen or eliminating some elements of the backdrop and making the bodies of fallen enemies disappear. Among other things, the graphics of the game are not bad considering the hardware on which it runs, and despite the inevitable downgrade also in terms of effects and textures, the glance is quite similar to that of the PlayStation 3 version, thanks also to the artistic style used by the production, which rests its foundations on the cartoon style guaranteed by cel shading. The sound sector is beautiful, which in addition to a fair and varied amount of game effects can count on an excellent dubbing in Italian. Finally, to act as a side dish and to underline every moment of the adventure there is an apt soundtrack, which while not proving to be unforgettable, still performs its task well, taking up the light-hearted tone of the story with its notes. The multiplayer Although it can count on a beautiful single-player campaign, Borderlands 2 was originally designed to be enjoyed best in multiplayer mode. In this sense, even on PlayStation Vita we wanted to give space, even if in a reduced form, to multiplayer games which take place in this case in online co-op mode for up to two players, with support for voice chat also via the microphone built into the console.", "date": "2014-06-09", "grade": "5.8"}
