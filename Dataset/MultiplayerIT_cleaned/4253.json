Indeed, the fact that we find ourselves considering a sandbox strange in which there is no need to kill anyone or destroy something should probably make us reflect a little on what is considered normality in the videogame field, and make us understand how some things we give taken for granted or even necessary, they can still be reviewed under different perspectives. The peculiarity of Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is therefore the fact of going precisely in this direction little explored by traditional game design, proposing a vast world to be explored in an essentially peaceful way, seeking harmonious contact with nature and with the other characters who populate the environment. We are not dealing with a truly ecological approach, given that it is still a question of going around collecting resources and solving contingent problems, but this peaceful attitude to which the game forces us becomes a reason for real relaxation, almost acting as a detachment from routine and ~double escapism~, so to speak, both from the real reality and from the standardized one of the current videogame worlds. This is certainly the strong point of the Prideful Sloth game, on the other hand presented right from the start as the backbone of the whole experience and the cornerstone of the construction of the vast open world made available to the player. Whether this can actually be enough to build a good all-round game is another matter, and the question actually arises as a critical element to be evaluated, but in the meantime there is no doubt that the intrinsic pacifism gives a particular identity to the All. Explorer omni-tool The protagonist is a young man who returns to his native land after it has been hit by a mysterious cataclysm, and finally arrives there after a shipwreck essentially having to start from scratch, with his backpack on his shoulder and a great desire to explore. Gemea, this is the name of the large area in question, is made up of different biomes, or ecosystems characterized by different climates, fauna and flora, where nature in general has the upper hand over a civilization that has developed harmoniously with the environment, leaving large open and uninhabited spaces. However, the problem of Miasma is grafted into all this: a consequence of the evil that struck the area years earlier, it is a sort of toxic fog that covers some areas and can only be eradicated through the use of magical sprites that are scattered around around the world. This represents one of the main elements of progression present in Yonder, so the search for spirits becomes essential to free the various areas of Gemea and open new accesses and game possibilities, given that the more extensive the miasma is, the greater the amount of spirits necessary to eradicate it. In fact, there isn't much else to mark a sort of progress in the game, beyond the desire to explore the world: the narrative substrate is barely hinted at through terse dialogues with the NPCs or documents scattered around the areas, with sporadic particular events to reveal something of a story that always remains a sort of vague background scenography. The ~role-playing~ elements are exclusively linked to the ability to use new tools and create new objects, so crafting is the real gameplay engine in Yonder, to which a farm construction and management system is associated that adds a Harvest-style touch Moon (or Stardew Valley, to be more trendy) at the property. Minecraft + Harvest Moon Yonder is therefore more Minecraft than Zelda, although the appearance can be deceiving: the total absence of combat and action elements, as well as dungeons with puzzles to solve makes it more similar to games based on exploration and crafting such as the famous title Mojang which to a real adventure, despite the presence of non-player characters and quests to complete. The most appropriate term of comparison is probably Dragon Quest Builders, also derived from Minecraft but already set on a hybridization that has a lot in common with Yonder, however the latter presents itself as a half-way by completely renouncing both role-playing elements and adventurous that are instead well present in the Square Enix title, both by also eliminating all the survival features that are typical of Minecraft. We say all this to give an idea of this particular gameplay, certainly not to find a forced cataloging for a title that obviously wants to escape the classic interpretation grids of videogame features. This determines a very specific identity for Yonder, which he findsin the mix of exploration, research and agricultural management its particular balance, even if the question on the possibility that this could represent a fairly demanding and self-sufficient mechanism remains legitimate. The fact of maintaining a ~light~ contact with the surrounding world leads us to be above all spectators of the wonders of Gemea rather than actors in a change prompted by our adventure, which is reflected in the superficiality of the missions that are proposed to us, in most rather simple fetch quests that lead to not exactly shocking rewards. Perhaps the deepest and most demanding part, in terms of play mechanics, is probably the management part linked to the farm, which relies on features tested by classics such as Harvest Moon and manages to capture the player inclined to rural life also thanks to the natural variety that characterizes the game world. A wonderful world The real protagonist of Yonder is therefore Gemea, the game world whose exploration and contemplation represents the engine of every action. The elimination of any risk factor, given the absence of real enemies and physiological survival needs, frees the action from any contingency and allows you to easily explore the world and all its specific regions well differentiated by the presence of different biomes. Also in this case the effect is twofold, because if on the one hand this can represent a celebration for those who simply seek immersion in marvelous worlds to contemplate in peace, on the other it does not offer particular incentives to go on once seen a good part of the fascinating glimpses that the game has to offer. In any case, it is noted how the developers Prideful Sloth wanted to devote great care in creating a beautiful and varied world, characterized by a style that favors total immersion in its peaceful atmospheres. Here too the solution adopted reflects the general spirit, proposing a wonderful scenographic system that is more to look at than to touch: if the principle of Minecraft and its derivatives is total interaction with the surrounding environment, the possibility of modifying it and building new structures , Gemea's careful construction obviously forces a more limited contact, making it impossible to deeply modify and build anything anywhere you want. It is obviously an inevitable consequence of building a complex and structured world in different ecosystems, a choice that pushes more on the passive fascination of exploration than on the activity of construction. Precisely the contemplation of the aesthetic aspect of Yonder is somewhat affected by a lack of consistency in the performances, which on Switch accuse frame-rate drops in the more open areas and in general a certain fluctuation in fluidity on many occasions, even if the thing it's not particularly bad given the rather relaxed pace of the game.", "date": "2018-05-18", "grade": "7.2"}
