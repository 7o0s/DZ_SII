{"name": "Top Spin arriva su PC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/top-spin-arriva-su-pc.html", "text": "Presumption of control You start playing Top Spin in its PC incarnation well in mind of the splendid Xbox version. The first question that arises when installing it is whether the conversion will be successful or not. In other words, one wonders if the developers will have made an enhancement of the original or a simple port... but let's not give the answer right away, let's leave the jokes for last. Let's start with an assumption: Top Spin is the best tennis game made for PC, clearly superior even to its closest competitor, that Virtua Tennis to which it owes a lot but which manages to surpass quite clearly (also because the Sega game was converted rather raw, just to put it mildly). To realize this, it is enough to take the field. As an example let's set up a friendly match between two male players to take place on a professional field. The service is up to us. We perform a simple and decidedly weak blow to start the match. The selected players we have chosen among those included by default in the game, both are ~real~ players (too bad for the lack of some updated licenses compared to the Xbox version) and both are quite skilled thanks to their exceptional characteristics. Top Spin is the best tennis game made for PC, clearly superior even to its closest competitor, that Virtua Tennis to which it owes a lot but which it manages to overcome quite clearly The first exchanges are, obviously, in complete favor of the CPU, since we have not yet become familiar with the six keys necessary to execute as many types of shots (controlled shot, slice, top spin, lob, powerful and drop shot; for the latter two it should be specified that they work differently than the others and also require a certain precision in execution, precision represented by the need to release the key when the swaying bar is as close as possible to the central meter). Presumption of control It takes little to become familiar with the control system. In reality it is still too early for subtleties but, after a couple of games in which we have been left without scores, we begin to respond more effectively to the broadsides that arrive from the other side of the field and we manage to make the audience applaud more convinced (the intensity of the applause varies according to the beauty of the exchanges, the effect is very effective and manages to involve the player more in the game). It only takes a few minutes to realize that you have forgotten that you are holding an analog joypad (a peripheral that is not essential but which we strongly recommend for playing at its best) and that you are in front of a computer. Top Spin succeeds in hypnotizing with the perfection of its gameplay. the concept is very simple: as Advantage Tennis taught the world (we are talking about the Amiga era) it was not necessary, for the economy of the gameplay, an absolute precision on the part of the gamer, in issuing the commands to execute the relative strokes. It was enough for the program to ~intuit~ his will and act accordingly. All this translates into a series of scripts which, starting from a very ~random~ basic input (just press any key to see the tennis player look for the ideal position to hit the ball) allow a fast and dynamic action as much as possible. as close to reality as possible. Obviously the quality of the scripts also determines a large part of the quality of the game because their effectiveness and precision corresponds to a greater or lesser involvement on the part of the user who, in any case, does not seek the thrill of being on a tennis court but that, more post-modern, to observe a game in a ~divine~ way claiming to have control over it and to be able to determine its fate (therefore shunning the frustration of practice and dedication). Presumption of control Games, sets and matches Top Spin from this point of view is excellent. Except for some physiological imperfections, mainly due to the sensitivity of some players' responses on the pitch, no errors can be found in his script system. As we said above, the games played are perfect mechanisms of pure playful excitement, thanks also to the ability of the AI, at the most advanced levels, to respond well to the various strokes of the user. Especially when facing the top 10 players in the standings, you find yourself competing against opponents who are able to anticipate our moves by targeting the areas of the field left uncovered. Of course, it is true that going below those 10 you will meet total brocchi unable to worry in the slightest, especially if you are already masters of the field and have many career stars distributed. Games, sets and matches Having mentioned rankings and career stars it would be appropriate to talk about the various modes from which Top Spin is composed. In reality there is little to say: if you want you can participate in a friendly challenge, organize a tournament with personalized options, take part in online challenges and, dulcis in fundo, ~pick up~ a player in his infancy (100th place in the standings ) to make him climb the peaks of the world tennis cheek bringing him to 1. For those who have not understood it we are talking about the so-called (and inevitable) career mode. Choosing to face it, it will first of all be necessary to create your own tennis player, using the very complete editor included, which allows you to model every single physical aspect, almost as if you were playing an MMORPG. Once this is done, you will access the map of the starting continent (determined by the nationality of your tennis player) in which various actions can be carried out: we will find shops in which to buy gadgets and change the look, sponsors to convince to drop money by taking part in various skill tests (obviously always tennis), training fields in which to pass various tests in order to assign the aforementioned career stars, an airport to be used to travel to other continents and, finally, the locations where the various available tournaments take place (each with own field optimally reconstructed, seeing some screenshots is believing). Of course, not all options will be selectable at first. Tournaments, for example, are divided into various categories and, before participating in the most prestigious competitions, it will be necessary to win the less important ones. The training fields themselves will have to be tackled gradually: you will be able to train in service, forehand, backhand and volleys, acquiring specializations for each shot category and arriving at a maximum of 14 stars. Games, sets and matches Con-ver-sio-ne (hyphenating is always very cool) Weren't we talking a lot above about successful or unsuccessful conversion? How can you forget... oh well, if you want you can leave this topic out, even if it would be a shame to do so given the excellent work done by the guys at PAM, which is not a brand of detergents but the name of the software house behind Top Spin. Graphically, all the problems encountered in the preview version of the game have been solved: the spectators have disappeared intermittently, many of the weaker textures from the Xbox have been replaced and the movements of the tennis players no longer present any imperfections as well as the framerate which is always the same at more than satisfactory levels. If we wanted to nitpick (but do we want to? Yes, come on also because if we then have to prepare the omelette, with the hairs comes a little disgusting!) we could say that the logos of the Microsoft box that appear from everywhere could annoy picciists more fanatical and that someone would have preferred a few more shots during the action since there are only two (although, to tell the truth, that's enough and more). But otherwise you can't really complain. Just as we can't complain about the sound side given the quality of the effects that perfectly make the idea of being on the playing field (the clay fields are the ones that produce the best sound effects ... but this is only a personal opinion) . Con-ver-sio-ne (hyphenating is always very cool) Creating a good tennis game is not easy. The relationships between the different elements that coexist on the screen make it difficult to choose which stylistic approach to adopt in an attempt to convey the essence of this sport. The ultra-realistic approach tried by some has proved unsuccessful: having to execute the shots in the right timing trying to be in an optimal position has made more than one title frustrating. It is the arcade approach that has most convinced the public over the years, partly because the average gamer is always looking for immediate fun and partly because simplification has made it possible to reveal the key element that allows the transition imaginative from real tennis to simulated tennis: the reproduction of movement. Comment As we said at the top of the article, Top Spin is the best tennis game available on PC. There's no rain on this. Moreover, it is a period in which there is a shortage of titles dedicated to this glorious sport ... so you sum up. The only reason to ignore it may be the hatred of tennis. But if so, why are you reading this article? Pros: Perfect game dynamics Graphically excellent It really lasts a long time Cons: Tennis players' licenses not updated Too many crooks among the opponents But why are there still Xbox logos?", "date": "2004-10-19", "grade": null}
