The goal to complete each level is to collect a certain number of objects, but clearly you can go much further and explore the locations far and wide in search of bonuses and secrets, this until we reach the ~finish line~ that will project us towards the next challenge. There are several games that have monkeys as protagonists, and the first that come to mind are undoubtedly the classic arcade Toki as well as the excellent Ape Escape for PlayStation 2. Rasta Monkey does not stop at this single peculiar choice, but tries a interesting fusion with what are the fundamental traits of the Rastafarian culture: reggae music, Jamaican colors and an unmistakable accent that distinguishes the sampled phrases present in the game. Jump what passes you As mentioned above, in the new title Nitako we have a specific goal for completing each level, or the collection of objects that are indicated to us at the start. However, we can go further and have fun defining the limits of the scenario, mostly composed of tree-like structures full of branches. The latter, these ~branches~, play a central role in the gameplay, given that in fact they represent the only surface that can be traveled by our little monkey, who does not want to go down to the ground (also because there is a huge abyss that the waits in case he loses his grip). On balance, Rasta Monkey draws heavily from titles such as Rolando (or, clearly, from LocoRoco) as regards the movement methods of the character, who in this case is forced to jump from one ~branch~ to another following a procedure based on timing and coordination. The game control system sees us dictating the movement of the monkey by touching the ends of the touch screen, but clearly the character stops as soon as he reaches the end of the structure he is walking through. To jump to another ~tree~ and continue the exploration, you have to touch the screen with two fingers and then release when you want to take the leap. As soon as we start loading the maneuver, the little monkey begins to rotate on the branch and leaves it in correspondence with our input, so we need to calculate the times and remove our fingers from the touch screen when the direction of the jump is the desired one. In all this mechanism an important inertial factor comes into play which we cannot ignore, and which makes the operation anything but simple to carry out, especially when there are threats to avoid, which happens quite often as we proceed for levels. Luckily we have the possibility to select our little monkey from a rose that gets richer as we unlock new characters, all with different characteristics. There is therefore the possibility of using a primacy more suitable for certain purposes, more snappy or more precise during jumps, depending on the needs and the scenario. Technically, a good job has been done: bright colours, smooth scrolling and a pleasant style are accompanied by captivating reggae rhythms. Some solutions appear simplistic, but everything is justified by the very affordable price (only 79 cents). The tested version is 1.6.5 App Store links", "date": "2010-03-19", "grade": "7.0"}
