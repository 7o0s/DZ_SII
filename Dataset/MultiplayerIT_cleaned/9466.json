{"name": "Haunted House", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/85345-haunted-house-i-fantasmi-del-passato.html", "text": "If the classic show of hands were called to find out how many people remember the original Haunted House, probably few would answer the call: not only does the title date back to videogame prehistory (we're talking about the year 1981), but it didn't even give rise to sequel of sorts, remaining a name whose appeal has faded over the years, until it was almost forgotten. However, it was an adventure in which the player had to explore the dark rooms of a haunted house, collecting objects and avoiding contact with ghosts. A formula that the ImaginEngine team has not felt like overturning, proposing a gameplay that is decidedly faithful to the original: a decision that, after playing this new Haunted House, does not seem to have been particularly wise. The specter of the remake Unlike its inspirer, Haunted House is supported by a storyline, slender but still present: the user can impersonate one of the two Silverspring brothers (Jacob and Silvia), who decide to explore the dark Graves Mansion, place where traces of their beloved grandfather have been lost. The decision to take on the role of one of the two protagonists changes absolutely nothing in terms of gameplay, and the plot itself loses importance after just a few minutes of play, remaining confined to some very forgettable cutscenes with static images and diary fragments that they can find on their way, which - needless to do it on purpose - do not really constitute what is defined as an exciting read. The personality therefore does not represent the strong point of the Atari production, which at least however tries to defend itself from a technical point of view, succeeding only in part. Graphically, Haunted House is framed from a bird's eye view, an aspect that in itself does not rhyme with spectacularity and which is in cahoots with an excessive recycling of settings and elements of the scenario, a devastating combo that makes each stage the same to the previous one. The polygonal models of the protagonists and of the various ghosts and little monsters that infest the Graves Mansion are also of little importance, squared and equipped with just enough animations. Good light effects intervene to save the situation, but they are certainly not enhanced by the low definition of the Nintendo console. It goes a little better on the sound front, thanks to a discreet dubbing, a spot-on musical accompaniment and valid sound effects, which however are re-proposed with such frequency as to soon make them repetitive. Alone in the dark Mediocre in terms of presentation, Haunted House manages to do even worse in terms of gameplay, presenting questionable playful solutions that make it unsuitable even for a young audience. Before tackling this topic, however, let's immediately remove the doubt from those nostalgic for the original product who hoped for a properly done remake: the work of ImaginEngine is incredibly sparse, devoid of content and bite, unable to give the same emotions as the title dated 1981 To begin with, the game offers a level of challenge close to zero, accompanied by the total lack of suspense related to the search of the house or meeting the various ghosts. What is most annoying, however, is the extreme limitation of a gameplay that could and should have been richer. All that the user has to do during the -short- single player experience is cross rooms, avoid enemies and rummage through drawers, bookcases and chests in order to obtain essential objects to shed light or artifacts whose sole purpose is to show off in a useless trophy case. End. Some ~pull the lever to open the door~ style puzzle is the only luxury that Haunted House allows itself in a general framework of extraordinary flatness, which not even the two-player cooperative mode can solve. The presence of the original game as an unlockable extra would have at least given the Atari product a minimum of credit among retrogaming enthusiasts, but even this aspect cannot be clung to, since it is completely missing together with any type of content useful for due to the replay value. In short, after those scarce couple of hours of complete monotony necessary to complete Haunted House, there isn't even a small prize that justifies such a waste of time...", "date": "2011-02-17", "grade": "5.0"}
