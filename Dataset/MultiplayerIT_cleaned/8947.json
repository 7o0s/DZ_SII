The new brand created by Monte Cristo was actually quite ominous for the team, given that precisely because of its unfortunate fate on the market, the Paris-based studio was forced to close its doors definitively during 2010. But as often we have seen it happen with other titles, the Cities XL series has survived passing into the hands of Focus Home Interactive, which with Cities XL 2011 has tried to correct the shot by bringing to our screens a version quite similar to the first chapter, but different above all from one point of view: the one if we want to be more important and distinctive, linked to the game mechanics via the Internet. The title was in fact initially conceived as an ambitious attempt to merge the city building that finds its all-time masterpiece in Sim City, with the modern mechanics of massive online games: the result was certainly interesting, but various types of problems caused the bankruptcy a few months after its release. Event also due to an MMO-style subscription that many did not want to digest. The idea of Focus Home Interactive was therefore to take Cities XL and make it a classic citysim, reduced in ambitions and without an online component, but able to take what was good inside the product created by Monte Christ. The rest is the history of this last year, during which Cities XL 2012 was announced as a further update of what was already seen in its predecessor. A full-fledged DLC In the light of what has just been said, let's immediately clarify that if you were expecting any kind of renewal with Cities XL 2012, unfortunately you will not be satisfied. The new title is to all intents and purposes an expansion of Cities XL 2011, available in both a standalone and an updated version with a consequent change in price: inside we find many new buildings, new maps and the introduction of modding tools, useful to give life to one's own creations to be shared online, or vice versa connect to the network to download and play the brainchild of others. Having said that, it therefore appears clear how the game mechanics have practically remained the same, first of all the type of game that fits perfectly into the sandbox sphere: no campaign that can therefore have a plot to follow, but simply the possibility of choose where to start building to give life to your city, carrying it forward with the aim of increasingly satisfying your citizens by progressively increasing the number. The new elements therefore add further choices without changing the basis of the game, which therefore continues to be (whether one likes it or not) that of Cities XL 2011: some may not even like the fact that the player is invited to build more than a single city, thus creating a network of trade between different places capable of replacing what were the mechanics studied for the online component of the original Cities XL. If on the one hand this feature offers the possibility of experimenting with different creation strategies, on the other hand the need to give up one's ~creature~ to start from scratch could be annoying. The purely sandbox nature of the game remains unchanged, as we said, making the engine that manages the growth of the cities one of the most appreciable aspects of this series, which unfortunately suffers historically from a certain lack of depth: the possibility of accessing new elements is based mainly on the number of inhabitants (in this regard, the lack of possibility of building a public transport system from the beginning of the game is to blame), while the whole procedure can be summarized in a few simple steps that follow one another. Between listening to the suggestions of the councilors and the complaints of the citizens, the impression is that sometimes the player simply finds himself chasing a series of tasks that have already been decided, rather than being able to actually put his skills to work to build a city worthy of being called that. Ungrateful core Even the technical sector of Cities XL 2012 takes up exactly what was seen in the previous chapters of the series: the graphics engine has not been rewritten, let alone overhauled, thus leaving the joys and pains already encountered in Cities XL to make themselves felt again. Watching the variety of buildings and miscellaneous constructions come up, now in even greater numbers, and the cities grow with its buildings along with famous real world landmarks is surely a pleasure. As well as the natural elementsi give their contribution to the very pleasant visual impact offered by Cities XL, which can also be enjoyed thanks to the practically maximum zoom level capable of taking us down to street level. The interface developed by the developers is as simple and minimal as it is powerful, giving the player a series of very valid tools to make the city he has in mind become ~reality~. However, the problem lies in the performance of the game, which is as jerky and suffering from the point of view of optimization as our city grows: at the basis of all this we find a problem that on the threshold of 2012 cannot be liquidated as recently , no support for CPUs with more than one core. That is to say all those present on the market for quite some time now. As far as the sound is concerned, there is nothing particular to point out, except that they remain quite catchy melodies, even if in the long run a bit monotonous.", "date": "2011-11-14", "grade": "6.5"}
