Unfortunately, that's not exactly the case: a certain quality can be seen throughout, setting and characters are fresh, but the team has not managed to escape the irresistible (and harmful?) charm of a couple of clichs of the game on the mobile platform. Let's see which ones. Can Avalanche Studios' first mobile game Rumble City have its say in such a market? Biker phones from Sweden We were talking about a fresh setting: not exactly something innovative in the extreme, but little seen, at least for a while. We are more or less in the United States of the 60s, when biker gangs competed with each other and with the police for the most important stars and stripes cities. You are at the controls of one of these gangs, first of all grappling with the forces of order who seem to have dismantled it - the very first objective is in fact, in the role of the boss, to get out of prison and reunite all the old members - and then with the rivals ever, the Jesters, who seem to have played more than one role in the recent debacle. All this in a very classic, for the hardware involved, turn-based strategy with an isometric view, with the different stages divided into boxes in which to easily control the various characters with your fingers. The genre is quite inflated on tablets and mobile phones, the first concession to a fairly prudent way of approaching this market, but certainly not the worst, indeed, considering the way in which this genre is declined. The stages are to be tackled sequentially on three different maps, and every now and then you come across a level that cannot be unlocked unless you have previously collected the required number of stars, up to three for each based on your performance. But when you get to the heart, you discover a well-finished creation: the gang includes different characters, each with their own role, from the classic thug to someone who uses beer bottles as a throwing weapon up to a vaguely sadomasochistic female biker who, armed with a whip , strikes from a distance and can move enemies one square. And each internship is structured on the basis of these characteristics, in order to let you make the most of them by racking your brains first to survive, and then to obtain the maximum evaluation. In short, the level design is certainly of great caliber, such as to not forgive you for a false move right from the first levels. And this is certainly a sign of great study and care. Insert cash However, when you begin to take a liking to this particular vision of a strategy that becomes almost a puzzle as far as it is necessary to plan your moves well, and you see that soon the opponents begin to be much more numerous than the members of your team, which the 'energy lost with each blow is really a lot and is not recovered after a victory, that bonuses and upgrades that can be purchased in virtual currency (earned at each stage) are few and not very effective, and that the stages themselves become increasingly convoluted and dangerous, one begins to wonder why Avalanche has devoted so much attention to providing such a difficult and harsh experience: to extort money from it. In fact, Rumble City offers us the classic and hated freemium model, in which alongside the virtual currency you can decide to spend the real one as well, to ensure large quantities of ingots with which to stock up on healing and enhancing items and face at least part of the journey in relative tranquility. We are not facing the most hateful freemium in history, this is not. It is always possible, for example, to face a fight already won to make some cash, and in extreme cases you can stop playing for a while and wait for the characters' energy to recharge by itself, however a certain sadness remains in noting that programmers who evidently know their business have been ~forced~ to limit the potential of their strategy to enslave themselves to a formula that is already not the nicest thing in the universe. And that programmers know their stuff is also clear from the graphic design, in a nice and detailed, especially in terms of animations, 3D, which gives its best on larger screens. Little to report on the sound front instead, forgettable tunes but effects, especially the various screams of the characters, quite noteworthy.", "date": "2015-07-15", "grade": "5.8"}
