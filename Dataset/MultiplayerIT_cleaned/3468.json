In addition to this, it is also a very interesting puzzle game, as we try to explain in this Where Cards Fall review. The simple yet strange idea behind the game came to designer Sam Rosenthal listening to Radiohead's House of Cards, as the author has told on several occasions, however it took a long time and then a favorable distribution channel like the new service on Apple subscription in order to finally get to fruition. As Rosenthal argues, the concept is to take the metaphor of the house of cards sung by the Oxfordshire band and interpret it in a very practical way, building a puzzle on it in which the card structures are not only fragile homes but also indispensable passage points to reach the goal, bridges to invent and build to connect different people and places. The rarefied atmospheres are reminiscent of metaphysical puzzles such as Monument Valley but the setting here has fallen deeper into reality, staging a story of growth and maturation through various characteristic events in the life of an ordinary boy. The narration is barely mentioned, but in the interlude scenes that come alive at the end of each level it is possible to reconstruct the years of youth through seemingly simple and light moments, but able to bring with them the distinctive features that affect the character of the protagonist and lead it to grow. What emerges from the story is a mixture of melancholy and desire to move forward, which does not use words or understandable dialogue to leave everything a bit approximate and open to different interpretations. On the other hand, to be honest, it is also a marginal element in the gameplay of Where Cards Fall, which could very well stand on its own but which certainly obtains a greater depth and above all a more marked tone and sense of progression with the support of the scenes animate between layers. Houses of cards and decks to pass Where Cards Fall is the classic game that is really complicated to explain in words, but which you understand practically immediately as soon as you come into contact with it, also because the tactile control system is the most intuitive there can be. Essentially, it is a question of going from a starting point to an arrival point within the various levels, but the path is interrupted in various points, with the finish line which is often also placed at a different height and with the protagonist not can climb vertical walls. Scattered around the settings you can find decks of cards, which can be dragged to different floors (provided there is at least one free square for them to pass) and then deployed to build different structures: houses with flat roofs, which provide flat platforms to go from one point to another at the same level of height or structures with a sloping roof, which also allow you to go up one level in height by using the slope of the roof as a ramp. The card structures can be more or less large (and tall, depending on the types) based on how much space we have available: the mechanics are very simple, just spread or squeeze your fingers on the screen to vary the size of the base of the structure in relation to the free boxes available. The advice is to watch a video to get a more precise idea of how everything works, given that the explanation can actually be difficult to understand. In any case, it is an excellent basic idea, also supported with a fair amount of care in the design of the levels, so it is possible to find yourself facing some very stimulating challenges. It must be said that the level design has its ups and downs, with some situations that become rather predictable and a certain inconstancy in the level of challenge, however the introduction of variations such as differentiated structures and the construction of puzzles based on the differences in level of height (with the ability to drag card decks for ramps, or the use of clouds within dream levels that introduce the ability to change their height based on the weight of the structures built above) work well for enriching the game solutions and provide new elements to think about. One would think that the gameplay would have benefited from greater variations of this type, increasing the amount of possible constructions or elements of the scenario capable of providing new alternatives, because in the long run the mechanicsit's a bit repetitive. The graphics that filter realistic elements in a dreamy and stylized perspective are very beautiful and inspired, although the game is a bit thought out to manage even on not too archaic devices such as a 2017 iPad. Also note the occurrence of some crashes in the course of the trial they made the app close automatically.", "date": "2019-09-30", "grade": "8.0"}
