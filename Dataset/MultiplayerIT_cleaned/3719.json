{"name": "Anno 1800", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/anno-1800-recensione.html", "text": "Anno 1800 has managed to resume the Anno series by the hair from the maelstrom into which the previous chapters were dragging it (Anno 2070 and Anno 2205), not bad in the absolute sense, but too busy integrating improper and compromised mechanics to be truly convincing . Blue Byte has therefore decided to do self-analysis and to go back to looking at her masterpiece, Year 1404, to give the series the prestige it deserves. In no uncertain terms, among the triple A productions, Anno 1800 is the best city management software in recent years, much superior to the recent and still valid Tropico 6. The reason? Let's try to understand it. Mode Anno 1800 has several modes, both for solo players and for those who want to spend time online. In single player it is possible to face the narrative campaign or dedicate oneself to the sandbox mode. As the title suggests, the setting is that of the industrial revolution, even if it must be said that the title of Blue Byte has very little history, at least in terms of plot. The campaign tells of the protagonist's return home after a long journey overseas, to find his father murdered and his company expropriated by his evil uncle. Together with his sister and an Indian friend he will therefore have to be able to develop an abandoned island, while simultaneously trying to find out who killed his parent. All this translates into a gameplay with two souls: on the one hand we have to worry about the construction and management of our city, while on the other we have to carry out sea missions to obtain resources and information from the other rulers. The narrative campaign map is fixed and designed in such a way as to accompany the progression of the game, both in terms of urban development and in terms of the succession of events. For example, in a precise moment of the plot we will be asked to remove a piece of mountain with dynamite to reach iron mines, without which not only it is not possible to produce some objects that we need to carry out a mission, but also to create some production lines that allow us to expand our city. Obviously all these constraints are not present in the fully configurable sandbox mode, in which given some initial resources, we are left free to experiment. In general, Anno 1800 can be tackled at different levels of difficulty, of which the simplest ones are truly suitable for everyone and the more difficult ones dedicated to fans of the genre. Fortunately, the compromises are few and only affect some aspects of the game. But let's not rush too much. User interface What amazes about Anno 1800, whatever the mode or difficulty selected, is the user interface, created with truly incredible care and intelligence. Blue Byte had the intuition to avoid the classic menus that include all the buildings of a certain category in a single screen, studying instead an intuitive system linked to the production lines, which allows you to immediately identify the structures to be built to obtain a certain resource and the type of workers required to operate them. The level of specialization of the latter is closely linked with the development of the urban fabric, which changes significantly with the modification of their needs. To say, the first type of workers, the agricultural ones, have few primary needs and are satisfied with modest houses. They are used to work the fields, raise animals, produce lumber and so on. More complex productions, such as that of glass or canned food, require specialized workers who are not satisfied with a frugal life, but ask for culture, entertainment and want more refined food. Until the needs of a certain social class are met, the next one cannot be accessed, i.e. the buildings in which citizens live cannot be upgraded to attract advanced workers. It is a simple and effective system, which has the great advantage of allowing in-depth planning of the city as well as never confusing the player, who can thus manage urban development in all its aspects. Another ingenious intuition of the interface, which from now on we want in every management system, is the planning mode, which allows you to place buildings on the map even in the absence of the required resources. Basically the player can create a skeleton of the city, anticipating his own moves. After placing a building blueprint on the map, it takes just one click to build it. Those who like to visualize things before deciding how to proceed will find it an incredibly versatile tool, which they will no longer be able to do without. Pure management From a management point of view, Anno 1800 ismade with great skill. It had been years since a triple A management system hadn't offered gameplay in which the city must be designed rationally and it is not enough to place buildings here and there to get everything. Here each building enters into a relationship with the others and there are many factors to be taken into consideration to create an economically sustainable urban fabric: from the quality of the roads, to the positioning of the inhabited districts, passing through that of the production buildings themselves, which must never be too far from sources of raw materials and warehouses, otherwise production will slow down. The only real simplification concerns the unified warehouses which also contain and make available the resources stored in very distant areas. Evidently we wanted to avoid overcomplicating the logistics of the goods, making the player concentrate on something else, in particular on satisfying the needs of citizens. In short, in the case of Anno 1800 some simplifications seem more like a way to not weigh down the gameplay than shortcuts to attract the general public. Be that as it may, rational urban planning also gives other advantages, such as the lower monetary expenditure to maintain law enforcement and firefighters, as well as the greater influence of schools, markets, pubs and other buildings that provide indispensable services for the population . Also not to be underestimated is the maritime side of the game, which starts with the construction of a fully equipped port (master's office, warehouses, arsenal and so on), to arrive at having a commercial and military fleet capable of dominating the seas. Knowing how to manage trade, making friends with the other rulers so as to be able to establish increasingly fruitful routes, is essential for the economy of our city, as well as having ships that can defend us from pirates and aggression from opposing factions. Managing vessels is really very simple: just select them and click on the point on the map where they have to go to make them move. When you are in ports, you can load, unload or sell goods, or you can take on board personalities with special abilities. As mentioned, the ships also have the function of avatars to carry out some of the missions that are assigned to us and to organize expeditions that are used to discover new territories. Unfortunately, some of these missions represent one of the biggest weaknesses of the Blue Byte title, given that they are often uninteresting, if not exactly asphyxiating. We are thinking in particular of escort missions or pursuit missions, both of which require you to follow the movements of your vessel to avoid ambushes or to be seen. They have probably been put in to give some variety to the gameplay and to make the narrative campaign more interesting, but in essence they are negligible, if not annoying. Living city From a technical point of view, Anno 1800 is probably the best management software on the market. In terms of building details, Tropico 6 stands up to it (we use it as a comparison because it is very recent and of a similar production level), but from the point of view of the vitality of the city there is no comparison: the Blue Byte title offers an urban environment alive and full of citizens behaving credibly. Zooming into the streets and watching is a pleasure, which is repaid by nice events. For example, weddings are organized in the local church, while schoolyards are teeming with children playing. Build a square in front of the town hall and you will see it teeming with people. Furthermore, as the social classes present in the city increase, so does the variety of models of citizens, dressed differently to reflect their condition. Things are much worse with some of the ancillary elements of the single player campaign, such as the acting of the main characters. In this case it is almost fortunate that the dubbing is only in English. The texts are also bad, decidedly uninspired and sometimes annoying, with characters who continuously repeat the same sentences on diplomatic screens and who end up fragmenting the gameplay a bit with their intrusiveness. For heaven's sake, they are not defects that ruin the game, but since they are still very present, there is no doubt that they have an influence. Things are much better in the sandbox mode, which is the one that is actually played the most, but it's a shame that more could not have been done for the campaign.", "date": "2019-04-16", "grade": "8.5"}
