{"name": "Aquanox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/aquanox.html", "text": "The shadow of the GeForce So Aquanox falls to the bean to quell some of the controversies that have recently arisen, precisely due to the lack of exploitation of the processing capacity of these very expensive components. Furthermore, this is also a way to re-present the much abused shoot'em up genre. But let's go in order and let's see what this game has in store for us. An apocalyptic and wet future One of the key features of these games is the story. Don't you agree? Well think about what Wing Commander, X-Wing or FreeSpace would have been without a very solid background plot. Even Massive knows it very well, trying to create a complex and sophisticated plot made up of numerous characters (over 70 NPCs!!) and which sees us in the role of a mercenary named Emerald ~Dead-Eye~ Flint. Faithful adventure companion is Sally, who is not an attractive girl (although appearance can be deceiving), but the on-board computer software. Other than Windows! For each mission successfully completed, we buy credits that allow us to buy new weapons and equipment or change our vehicle among the nine available. We were talking about the plot: the year is 2666 and man has managed to make the entire surface of the planet uninhabitable, forcing the population to live at a depth of 5000m. How beautiful!! An apocalyptic and wet future Under the oceans new nations are formed, but the climate we live in is not the easiest where the law of the strongest is in force, and this is perhaps why we decided to become a mercenary. The Single player campaign consists of 30 missions, which are inserted in a fairly complex and captivating context. What I didn't like is the narrative method, made up of decidedly boring written dialogues. Sin. The Multiplayer is very pleasant, which although it does not introduce anything new compared to what we are already used to, is, due to the type of control and the graphics, very beautiful and satisfying. Jaw on the ground. This phrase has now fully entered the vocabulary of every gamer and indicates a graphic detail so beautiful that it leaves us speechless. Well Aquanox is largely part of those games that can boast this appellation. The images make a perfect idea of the enormous effort made to make this title credible. Choreograph the explosions and take care of the polygonal models of the units and structures. In short, from a graphic point of view Aquanox is a splendour. Jaw on the ground. Things change a little if we look at the gameplay, which is pleasant, but which presents somewhat extreme situations, such as when we find ourselves fighting against a flood of enemy fighters and come out almost without a scratch. Well things that only happen in video games. I must also underline the lack of commands that can be given to our comrades who act independently of our will. A decisive step back compared to what has already been seen in other titles. We are fruit The title of Massive presents lights and shadows. On the one hand a beautiful graphic impact and excellent playability, on the other a plot which, despite some interesting ideas, is mortified by some not very successful characters and an annoying dialogue system. We are fruit Concluding. Do you want to see something graphically striking? Do you want to test your trusty GeForce? Do you want simple but effective gameplay? If you answered yes to these questions, then Aquanox is your title. The shadow of the GeForce Some games owe their notoriety to aspects not really inherent to the game itself and Aquanox, an interesting 3D Shoot'em up by Massive Development (German software house, known in the news for having developed, back in 1996, Archimedean Dynasty a good shoot' em up 3D of which Aquanox is the natural sequel), is fully one of these. The reason is obvious: the interest in this title is derived from its ability to take full advantage of the amazing hardware features of the new Nvidia GeForce 3 video cards.", "date": "2002-01-15", "grade": null}
