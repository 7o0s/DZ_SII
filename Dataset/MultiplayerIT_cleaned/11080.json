{"name": "Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-ultimate-ninja-storm-recensione.html", "text": "Deadly dance The game, divided into two distinct and separate sections, allows us to relive the events of the first 135 episodes of the manga, or about half of the first part of Naruto's adventures. After a long mandatory installation process, more or less than ten minutes, we can choose whether to dedicate ourselves directly to the fights, only locally, however, or immerse ourselves in the actual story mode. On the first there is very little to say, there are 25 characters available, immediately and to be unlocked and 10 characters that can only be used as support for the protagonist of the clash. In fact, before each battle, the protagonist and the two fighting companions must obviously be chosen, which can be recalled using the L1 and R1 keys. Once this is done, before deciding the theater of battle, the choice falls on the magical art and the supreme technique to be used. The help characters are not only used to ring together devastating combos, but can, if pressed with the right timing, interrupt the opponent's attacks, saving the protagonist from certain death. The control method is quite simple, and fortunately it does not require memorizing long key sequences to press for the most powerful moves. The circle alone is used for ~physical~ attacks, kicks and punches, while the triangle is used to use the Chakra, a sort of instant power up. To conclude the square is used to throw the shurikens and X to jump; the L2 and R2 backbones, on the other hand, are used to block opponents' blows. During the fights then, depending on the level of the Chakra bar or the remaining energy, it is possible to carry out special moves, culminating with the devastating final moves, which benefit from a sort of quick time event, in which the keys indicated on the screen. The fights, also in the light of the objects that can be thrown using the directional cross, become, more than technical clashes between ninjas, a sort of hyperkinetic dance full of lights, special effects and devastating and bizarre moves, such as huge flashes of fire, spiked balls, packs of ravenous wolves, thunder, lightning and lightning bolts. An exceptional feast for the eyes, but definitely something that will not be appreciated by those who expect a technical title on which to spend a lot of time to master the most important techniques. It's all very simple and immediate, the choice of just the button for kicks and punches confirms it, and although it's very fun and rewarding, this is one of the limits of the game, effectively transforming the title almost into a sort of continuous button mashing. that is, push the keys ~furiously~, given that there are relatively few moments of pause. Let's be clear, not that pressing the keys blindly leads to certain victory, also because a sipped and appropriate use of the Chakra is required, but the impression is that on the altar of spectacularization, exaggerated dynamism and ease of use, there has been a a ~reasoned~ setting of the clashes may be sacrificed. Unfortunately, the lack of an online multiplayer mode castrates the longevity of the Free Battle mode, even if to be honest, CyberConnect2 has declared itself ready to release over time, practically since the day of release, new characters, both ~active~ that support, and new quests. The ghost village We talk about quests, as they are the fulcrum of the heart of the game, or the Supreme Mission mode, a sort of long and articulated story mode that allows us to relive the key events of the first part of Naruto's adventures. The Leaf Village, navigable in all its entirety, both by running along its avenues and by jumping from roof to roof while enjoying a breathtaking view, acts as a ~hub~ where you can collect the many missions needed to grow the protagonist of the game . There are many things to do, there are about a hundred missions to be tackled without a pre-established order, but which are still held together by the common thread of the orange ninja's first narrative arc. The fights, preparatory to becoming the most powerful of the Hokage, are interspersed with quests in which, interacting with the villagers, we are asked to collect flowers, find lost children, collect the secret scrolls scattered through the alleys and in the air, or test our skills in minigames where you have to climb trees or jump at breakneck speed in a lush forest. Then there are shops where you can buy useful items both for character growth (ramen shops to raise the Chakra bar) and those that sell collectible drawings and miniatures. Around then hidden in places not directly visible there are secret chests full of bonus items to be used in battle, and scrolls that are used to learnsecret techniques, which can then be configured at will at the time of the clash. The ghost village All these missions, both those in which you take the field and those that make such a bland role-playing game, have success conditions, consequently a certain replayability of the same is advocated to receive all the rewards up for grabs. The fights see us engaged, first alone, then with the full support team, both against ~normal~ fighters and against huge ~end of level~ bosses. Here too the critical issues found in the Free Battle mode return, however mitigated by the victory conditions, which allow us to focus more on the technique rather than on the repetitive pressing of the attack keys. However, in the long run, although there are many missions to complete, one feels a certain repetitiveness of the same, either because moving far and wide in the village is rather boring, both because of the long walks and because the city is as if it were ~dead~ ~, there is no interaction (besides destroying barrels), it stands still waiting for the ninja's actions, because apart from the quests related to the main storyline, all the others are quite simple and mechanical, a sort of filler implemented between fights and the other. Not that the village of the Leaf should be alive and pulsating like Liberty City or Bowerstone market, but it really seems to be on a film set, with the extras placed in strategic points and the emptiness behind the facades of the buildings. Credit to CyberConnect2 for going beyond a simple fighting game, but the final impression is that it hasn't gone beyond the well-crafted homework. The excellence of cel shading From a technical point of view Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm is simply outstanding. Everything is ~truer than true~, the excellent cel shading implemented is of great value, and frankly indistinguishable from the cutscenes that occasionally appear in the title. Detail, special effects, animations and fluidity are at the highest levels: the clashes in a totally 3D environment are to all intents and purposes a dance, with the excellent camera that also gives us suggestive shots. The frenzy of the clashes is rendered to perfection, and not infrequently, one is amazed in front of the confusion on stage between excellent light effects, flaming characters and decidedly powerful, devastating and at the same time hilarious final moves. Even the Foglia village, despite being poor in life, is well made, with pastel shades and a good variety of architectures, on which to roam far and wide, jumping like a cricket to get to the highest points from where to admire the panorama and the beautiful Mt. Rushmore-style ~drawn~ mountain. The models of the fighters were then recreated with incredible attention to detail, so fans of the manga will find in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm an accurate product that fully meets their expectations. On the audio side, there is no dubbing in Italian, but it is possible to choose between the English one and the original Japanese one. Comment Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm is certainly a title capable of delighting fans of the orange ninja, very fun, immediate and immediately rewarding. Precisely because of this, his being perhaps too dedicated to those who assiduously follow the manga, diminishes the attention of all the others, who will find the Supreme Mission mode with its dozens of missions uninteresting in the long run. sometimes very similar to each other and a frenetic and easy to assimilate, but not too technical combat system. Graphically, however, the title redeems these perplexities, thanks to a very valuable use of cel shading and the many special effects applied. Ultimately a good title, courageous in trying to go beyond the scaffolding of fighting games to meetings, but which does not fully succeed in its intent. Pros Excellent use of cel shading and special effects Lots of characters to play and unlock Fast, fun and easy to master... Cons .... maybe too much, not very technical and too prone to button mashing Story mode missions too similar between of them There is no online multiplayer", "date": "2008-11-06", "grade": null}
