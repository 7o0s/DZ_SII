A sector so far dominated by the battleship of Skylanders, a franchise that has had the merit not only of inventing the genre itself but also of dominating it from a commercial point of view, even managing to force a giant like Disney to close the doors of its equivalent Infinity. So let's see if LEGO Dimensions has the right numbers to fight for the supremacy... LEGO Dimensions carries the strengths (and weaknesses) of the series in the universe of toys to life Build and play The most substantial difference that separates LEGO Dimensions from the main competitors lies precisely in the greater ~playfulness~ of the physical component of the product: instead of proposing simple figurines as done by Skylanders and Disney Infinity, each pack that can be purchased in stores contains the quantity of bricks necessary to build the characters, vehicles and structures that stand out on the packaging and which will then actually be displayed within the video game. To do this, you must use the Toy Pad included in the Starter Pack, a device to be connected via USB to the console that allows you to detect the pieces that are placed on it and reproduce the related models in the game. Also in this case, there are variations with respect to what was proposed by Activision and Disney with their peripherals: here it is in fact possible to position the beauty of seven units between characters and vehicles in the three sectors in which the Toy Pad is divided, and the interaction with the same device plays an even more central role in the gameplay, as we will find out later. Building constructions with LEGOs is in any case a great expedient, given that the software is obviously not able to detect whether they are built correctly or not: and yet, even if it would be sufficient to position the disks that are based on the models, it is extremely pleasant to take a break from the on-screen action to stop and tinker with the bricks, especially if you are sharing the LEGO Dimensions experience with a child: in this sense, the work of TT Games demonstrates how the The most genuinely transversal expression of the toys to life genre so far, even if it risks constituting a real attack on the finances of fans: the list of expansion packs already available inspired by a wide range of films and TV series is in fact quite nourished, and the support for the game seems to be destined to continue at a rapid pace in the coming months. Playstation 4 trophies LEGO Dimensions offers 48 trophies, including 31 bronze, 12 silver, 4 gold and one platinum. Of these, a good part is linked to the natural progress in the levels that make up the adventure, while others are dedicated to the collection of the (many) collectibles scattered in the various settings. In general, however, these are trophies within the reach of even the buyers of the Starter Pack only, although in this case a little more grinding is needed. There were Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle Focusing on the more strictly videogame contents of the Starter Pack subject of this review, it is not surprising to find ourselves faced with a very similar situation - if not exactly identical - to what has been proposed by TT Games for ten years now with the LEGO brand: let's talk of a rosewater action game, focused mainly on the collection of collectibles and on the resolution of very simple environmental puzzles and with an innate predisposition to cooperative multiplayer for two players locally. The protagonists of the adventure are Batman, Gandalf and Wyldstyle, sucked from their worlds by the evil Lord Vortech and forced to travel from one dimension to another to prevent the bad guy from gaining control of the entire LEGO universe. Even if it is a trivial pretext to allow the slender narrative arc to jump from one setting to another without giving too many explanations, it must be said that TT Games has exploited the opportunity flawlessly, putting a lot of care into the realization of the various scenarios (each with details and stylistic choices consistent with its source of inspiration) and spraying everything with the usual, hilarious irony that has always distinguished the series. It must be said, however, that the various jokes and skits that cheer up the adventure are mainly based on quotes and inside jokes typical of the format to which they refer, so if you don't know the topic wellment is lost a lot in terms of smiles. Still, going from battling flying monkeys in the World of Oz to chasing the Joker in Springfield to helping Doctor Who stop an army of robots makes it clear how much LEGO Dimensions has to offer in terms of sheer variety, at least from a scenic point of view. In terms of gameplay, in fact, you end up repeating the same things over and over again, and the huge amount of characters that you can buy and use freely by placing them on the Toy Pad serves more than anything else to unlock some secret passages and get extra bonuses, but in terms of skills and behavior the heroes can all be understood in a couple of categories differentiated by slight nuances. Structurally, then, the levels that make up the campaign are always very linear and end up making perhaps even excessive use of the dynamic puzzles that require tinkering with the Toy Pad: basically, it is always a matter of moving certain characters from one portion to another of the device to obtain the desired effect (be it freeing oneself from an enemy spell, activating a mechanism or so on), a process which - requiring almost no intellectual effort - is soon reduced to a boring routine. Even the frequent clashes with the bosses, although they are varied from a choreographic point of view and often fairly spectacular, are somewhat flattened by the almost zero challenge rate that distinguishes a title clearly oriented towards a young audience. On the other hand, there is no objection to the amount of content crammed into LEGO Dimensions: in addition to a substantial main adventure and a truly frightening amount of collectibles, the title offers a whole series of sandbox-style levels inspired by the brands that have joined the project which can be accessed by placing a character from the relevant universe on the Toy Pad.", "date": "2016-09-22", "grade": "8.2"}
