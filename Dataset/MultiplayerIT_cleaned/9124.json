The ever-increasing importance of the iOS platform has seen both of these excellent products arrive on the iPhone and iPad: Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit with its immediate gameplay, excellent technical realization and a story mode made up of large numbers, especially after the update that doubled the available races, implementing the possibility to race also as outlaw pilots; the here present Shift 2: Unleashed, which from the very beginning appears devoted to realism and which allows us to adjust the settings relating to driving down to the smallest detail. Accustomed to racing games that activate the external view by default, starting the game after downloading it and finding yourself racing using the internal camera of the car is already a small surprise in itself, which reveals all its peculiarities as soon as we access the options screen . In fact, Shift 2 proves to be excellent as regards controls via accelerometer, with the car which supports the inclination of the device in a very reactive and precise way, but initially assigns us an excessively assisted driving style: the automatic accelerator obviously it can be there, but also automating braking and activating cornering assistance can only return a distorted experience. Fortunately, it is indeed possible to change these values at will and gradually, deactivate them completely or reduce their impact, but also choose to do everything yourself between acceleration, braking and even changing gears. In our opinion, the solution with only the accelerator and automatic gearbox is the best for not giving up the simulation ambitions of the title developed by EA Mobile without exceeding in terms of cumbersome controls, but it is clear that everyone can really design the driving style around the your own tastes and needs. A great value for a mobile game. Quantity and quality In addition to offering an excellent driving feeling, Shift 2: Unleashed boasts respectable numbers, both in terms of available cars and races (there are forty). The career mode is the heart of the game and sees us spend the money earned with each victory to buy new cars or to upgrade and customize those in our possession, improving their acceleration, final speed, handling and even their endowment in terms of oxide of nitrogen, which can provide the boost you need to cross the finish line first when things look bad. Integration with Origin allows access and account management in cross-platform mode, therefore a new registration is not needed and we can enter using our data if necessary, but in this sense the lack of an online multiplayer mode is strongly disappointing, that could really have made this production leap in quality. The other limitations of Shift 2 are to be found mostly in the surrounding elements: the view from outside the car proves to be much less effective both in terms of gameplay and in terms of mere graphics, even if the developers have not worked badly at all. while the signed musical accompaniment is already anonymous after a few minutes. The technical sector in general is still excellent and is basically on a par with that of Hot Pursuit. The tested version is 1.0.1 Price: 3.99 App Store links", "date": "2011-08-24", "grade": "8.0"}
