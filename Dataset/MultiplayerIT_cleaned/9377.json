Especially for the love fruit shaped controller. In short, the game created by SEGA has always amazed, what better opportunity to exploit for its return than on the brand new Nintendo 3DS? Precisely, then, we are faced with one of the sagas that make the third dimension a key element of their gameplay, pivoting in the cardinal directions as in a sort of modern Marble Madness. Who hasn't tried playing those nice pastimes that are usually found in bars in front of the beaches, those made up of a kind of pinball machine where you have to tilt the plane to be able to get the ball to its destination? Monkey Ball is just that: simplicity, intuitiveness, a perfect game for a laptop and ideal for viewing in 3D. Double control system The main game is very easy to explain and make understood: inside a sphere, we have to roll our little monkey to the end of the level by running on suspension bridges, very narrow corridors and passages full of traps and difficulties, until we reach the hard-earned finish line, possibly before time runs out and having collected as many bananas as possible. All without falling down obviously, because each level is suspended in the air on very high and fatal overhangs. Super Monkey Ball 3D hinges almost entirely on the control system that allows you to direct your ball. Incorrect calibration of the controls would make the game unusable, or too frustrating. Luckily, SEGA programmers have had experience with all the previous chapters and bring back on 3DS a feeling that is still perfect, precise and ideal for moving precisely through the complicated levels of the game. Borrowing from the version for iOS systems, also in this chapter you can choose to guide your sphere with the gyroscopic controls. Fortunately, this is only a possibility, because in practice this system works very badly on the Nintendo portable console. In some situations we have to give the screen an inclination such as to no longer make our character clearly visible, with easily imaginable consequences. By activating 3D, as you might expect, it is also almost impossible to play because with every movement of the console, even the smallest, the visual ~synchrony~ with the three-dimensional effect is lost. Fortunately, the classic controls that use analog work wonderfully and indeed, the new Nintendo 3DS stick can finally be fully appreciated. Each character used has its own ~maneuverability~ based on the physical constitution, and here is that Baby is fast and quick, Gongon slower and more reasoned, MeeMee and AiAi are the more balanced monkeys. The gameplay does not undergo considerable variations from the selection of one over the other, but it is still tempting to be able to choose our favorite primate. 3D effect The very nature of the game probably prompted SEGA to decide to immediately release Super Monkey Ball on Nintendo 3DS. The levels are suspended in the air in a three-dimensional environment that is brought out well by the characteristics of the new Nintendo console. During the game, then, a certain coordination of movements and precision in execution is always required, factors certainly helped by depth vision which manages to make us distinguish distances better. In any case, a few small glitches on objects that appear too close (double up) do not affect what is still one of the best three-dimensional effects appreciated on Nintendo 3DS today. Rolling south, hunting for bananas From the main screen it is possible to access three modes: the first is the classic one, described above. Then the Monkey Race was included, which is basically a Mario Kart with monkeys instead of Nintendo characters, and the Monkey Fight, which instead follows the structure of Smash Bros. Both are playable both alone and in local multiplayer via wireless, but they are decidedly subdued compared to the ~original~ Nintendo, and represent nothing more than two mini-games to get distracted between one level and another of Super Monkey Ball 3DS. Monkey Race sees us compete against 7 other challengers across nine tracks divided into three distinct worlds. The power-ups available on the street don't seem to really make the difference between ~those who know how to use them~ and ~those who don't know how to use them~ (Mario Kart lovers will understand immediately), and the sense of speed of the Karts is very variable, a factor that never makes us feel completely at ease at vsmelling. The situation in Monkey Fight mode is no better. It is basically about fighting against three other players trying to collect as many bananas as possible. By hitting an opponent, he will drop all his bananas, and the winner is the one who at the end of the time has obtained and stolen the most. The gameplay is bare-bones: two attack types and the ability to jump up and down the level's suspended platforms, with a visual identical to Smash Bros. Given the poverty of the additional content, therefore, the SEGA title does not therefore enjoy incredible longevity: once the various worlds and related levels of the main mode are finished, they will hardly get their hands on our dear rolling monkeys. Although the difficulty progressively increases and the game manages to capture our attention and energies (up to levels of exasperation, at times), the eighty schemes run away quickly and are faced in a handful of hours, time that can double for less expert and younger players: a little, above all considering that once the ~assets~ for the game's graphics have been created, very little is needed to design an unprecedented course. The two alternative modes then do not seem capable of attracting attention for long, a pity this, given that such a simple but profound gameplay would lend itself well to endless playful applications. A level editor and the ability to share them, for example, but also a cooperative or competitive online mode are the main shortcomings in our opinion.", "date": "2011-04-01", "grade": "7.0"}
