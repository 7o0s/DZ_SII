Ivan Venturi's TiconBlu, an old acquaintance of the Italian videogame world (remember Simulmondo?), together with Imagimotion, have taken care of the literary work trying to make some key dynamics among those most appreciated by readers in videogames. The first thing you notice when playing it is that for now La Peste is only available in two languages: Italian and Latin. In general, it is an original idea, although not usable by everyone, which however helps to better enter the atmosphere. Of course, the lack of the English language is noted, the only one capable of guaranteeing the product a certain worldwide diffusion, but we are sure that it will soon be implemented. The game is available for different platforms, namely PC, Mac, iPad and soon Android tablets. The version we tested is the PC one. Having made the necessary premises, let's warm up the mouse and go straight into the adventure. I'm Eymerich, Nicola Eymerich Nicolas Eymerich, Inquisitor: The Plague is a classic graphic adventure, with a contextual point-and-click interface (the cursor icon changes depending on the selected hot-spot, with the left mouse button used to invoke the various actions available) which sees the player in the role of the grumpy inquisitor, a complex character with a character that is not exactly easy to decipher. At the beginning of the adventure our arrives in the abbey of Carcassonne where he receives an assignment from the slimy abbot who governs it: to find an inquisitor who has disappeared in a village in southern France, where it seems there are strange activities going on. Without being able to discuss the orders, Eymerich must work to prepare the trip, in the meantime getting as precise an idea as possible of the powers he will face. The aim of the player is therefore to carry out some research within the abbey, discovering its most hidden secrets, and then head towards its final destination. Inside the stone walls of that austere place, plagued by physical and moral corruption (imagine us with a pointing finger and a random holy book in hand, even a copy of Playboy is fine, which we don't want to be too blasphemous), Eymrich will find heresies and will discover strange happenings, all of which can be tackled with the mouse. In this sense we tell you without further hesitation that we are talking about a classic graphic adventure, with more or less logical puzzles to solve and elements of sure interest. Fans of the genre will be happy, also because some are really fun to solve. It is true that in various cases the solutions are not very obvious, but we are talking about a graphic adventure, so we may have to think for a few minutes about how to unblock the situation. Eymrich for everyone Nicolas Eymerich, Inquisitor: The Plague, and we also imagine the following chapters, has several interesting options that truly allow everyone to finish the adventure. By starting the game you can choose between two modes, namely the adventure mode, in which you have to solve all the puzzles, and the so-called Interactive Novel, which allows you to follow the story without worrying about the puzzles (you advance in the story by clicking on the mouse). Obviously the second greatly shortens the duration of the game. Another interesting option is the Audiogame mode which also allows blind people to enjoy the story. It is probably one of the first video games to have complete support in this sense. Penance One of the best elements of La Peste is certainly the setting, i.e. the care taken in the construction of the sets and narrative elements. For example, it is very nice to open and leaf through the pages of the book with Eymrich's notes, or to convince you we can mention an enigma built around historical facts that has proved to be particularly profound to solve, not so much in its dynamics as in its implications. In short, the first factor to appreciate Eymerich is not so much to weigh his characteristics, but to be passionate about his background, including the protagonist. Eymerich itself deserves a separate discussion. This is not the typical video game protagonist all muscles and no brains, but a cultured man of the church with often irritating and questionable attitudes. The good Nicolas is rude, sometimes even cruel in the peremptoriness of his sentences towards those in front of him, but it is precisely this otherness of his that puts him above many of the characters who have come and gone on our videogame screens. His way of approaching other human beings makes the dialogues an esperience in itself. You may be thinking that much of Eymrich's charm is due to Evangelisti rather than the developers, but we doubt that is the case. In the world of video games we have often seen works taken from films or novels trivialized beyond belief, just as we have seen works transformed into non-video games for fear of losing the contents of the originals. It would be enough to remember that Paulo Coelho also wrote a graphic adventure that turned out to be very little to give Eymerich's writing the value it deserves. The Holy Inquisition Unfortunately Eymerich also has its beautiful flaws. The most obvious is certainly the dubbing, not exactly exceptional. We solved it by putting the texts in Italian and the dubbing in Latin... so who knows how to recite in Latin? Another problem, deriving from the cross-platform nature of the game, is that graphically the work of TiconBlu has various uncertainties. Some sacrifices in terms of graphic detail will probably have been necessary to put the game into mobile platforms, where Eymerich actually offers its best from this point of view, but some problems are evident in the PC version. Another issue is longevity. We finished Eymerich in about five hours, which we consider a fair amount of time for the price it costs (it is possible to buy it digitally or in the boxed version, the latter slightly more expensive), but some may not think so, especially due to the fact that to follow the whole story you will need to buy four chapters. In reality we are in the average times of Telltale games, a reference model for episodic titles.", "date": "2012-12-12", "grade": "7.8"}
