{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 6 DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pro-evolution-soccer-6-ds-recensione.html", "text": "Portable football This Pro Evolution Soccer for Nintendo DS is therefore ~simply~ a portable adaptation of the game that we all (or almost) know very well, without variations in the structure, and therefore with a marginal use of the specific capabilities of the Nintendo portable. What results, therefore, is a small reduction of the Konami football game, not a variation on the theme, as perhaps would have been desirable. However, it remains a portable version of a great game, so it starts from a remarkable base value. Those who know the game in the home versions will know exactly where to get their hands on this edition: the structure is the same and the same layout of the keys corresponds exactly to the tradition of Pro Evolution Soccer. This introduces the expert player directly into the heart of the action, finding on the Nintendo DS those game dynamics typical of the football simulation, excellently reproduced in this adaptation. In any case, even the novice player will find a way to extricate himself from the possibilities offered, thanks to the lower difficulty level which represents an excellent introduction to the gameplay, and to the various training modes included among the options. The dual screen and touch screen have very limited use, in a game that broadly follows the tradition of the series: the bottom screen can be used to view the situation of the team during the match, or to see the famous ~ radar of the field, finally of generous dimensions. It is a pity to see that additional options have not been implemented, such as the possibility of acting on the position and tactics of the various players simply by clicking on their icons on the touch screen, with the ~tactile~ interaction limited to pressing the two keys that allow setting most offensive or defensive of the team. The tactics and game strategies must be set before the game, and possibly recalled during the game, as in the other chapters of the series. As far as player control is concerned, this PES is still the ~reduced~ version of the equivalents for major consoles: the player moves with the directional cross, the run is activated with the R, and the pass keys (short or through) , shooting, crossing and defensive action are arranged exactly the way Konami has used to us for years. Some of the more advanced dribbling techniques, feints and tricks found in the latest versions of the game on home consoles are missing, but the control and rather realistic behavior of the ball remains in this Nintendo DS adaptation, elements that distinguish the series from the competition: in particular , the passages enjoy a certain freedom from prearranged constraints, and there is the possibility of directing the ball more or less where you want, imparting the direction through the digital cross. Let's collect them all! There is a decidedly satisfying amount of options in this title, including exhibitions, single and multiplayer play, and preset cups, but above all in terms of team management. In addition to the normal competitions, the famous Master League is replaced here by the World Tour, which forms the basis of the single player game. In this mode, a certain managerial structure is associated with the simple football simulation: it is a question of bringing our team, initially composed of elements of the lowest order, higher and higher within the rankings, winning matches and making its general level evolve through the improvement of players and the purchase of new valuable elements. Each game won, or the achievement of certain objectives, earns some special coins, which can be spent in the Gasha-get, a sort of particular re-interpretation of the transfer market: it is a machine in which coins are introduced, and from which new players come out (inside a plastic ball, just like in the gadget dispensers that are around), of a value proportional to the level reached by one's team, and according to the type of currency used (gold or d ' silver, corresponding to the importance of the objectives achieved and obviously of different value). In this way it is possible to renew the roster of players available, with whom to develop an optimal formation, as well as strategies and tactics to be recalled during the game. The finishing work on the team, the management of the formation and the tactics to be used, are convincingly reported on the Nintendo DS, making customization a decidedly strong point of the game in question. Unfortunately, those licenses to which brands such as FIFA or the same Pro Evoluti are largely missingon Soccer, on home consoles, have by now got used to us: here we find the national teams, and some of the major clubs taken from the most important internal championships (such as Arsenal, Manchester UTD, Milan, Inter, Roma, Porto, etc.), but certainly not we are at the content levels of ~next gen football~. A particular mention should be made regarding the online multiplayer: it is in fact possible to play, as usual, via wireless LAN with an opponent, whether you both have the game cartridge, or with a single cartridge, but the revolutionary experience is the online multiplayer, feasible by connecting to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, with excellent results. The infrastructure is the same seen in other games that take advantage of the Nintendo online gaming service: each player is identified by the famous ~friend-code~, and if you want to play with a friend you must have memorized his code, otherwise it is also It is possible to leave the system the possibility of finding an opponent, selecting him among players of our same level, or picked at random from all over Europe. The online game does not seem to suffer from major latency problems, and represents a good solution that is always at hand to vary the experience and enrich it with a little remote multiplayer, which is essential in a football game. Also via wi-fi, it is also possible to view one's own statistics and results achieved, collected in a constantly updated online leaderboard, or to dedicate oneself to the transfer market by exchanging players with other remote users. A jump into the past It is evident that the Nintendo DS does not represent the ideal platform for the development of a high-profile sports simulation. The Pro Evolution Soccer series has accustomed us to a constant evolution from a technical point of view, with continuous graphic improvements, as regards polygonal modeling and animations of the characters, and reproductions of increasingly convincing stadiums, going towards a realism and a spectacularization of the increasingly evolved digital football. In light of this, playing this chapter for the Nintendo portable leaves the feeling of a dive into the past, in the period of the first chapters of the Konami series, when the angular and ~Pinocchio~ characters took their first uncertain steps in the still approximate polygonal reproductions of the stadiums. A solution could perhaps have been to adopt a different style from the counterpart for the other consoles, perhaps cartoonish, stylized or caricatured. The choice to maintain the same realistic style that distinguishes the series necessarily determines a raw aspect, given the intrinsic limitations of the Nintendo DS hardware compared to other consoles, and in any case the work done by Konami certainly does not stand at the the top of production on the dual-screen laptop. The players appear decidedly squared, and the animations a bit lacking, with the graphics generally ~spixellated~, given the low resolution. However, the visualization is functional for the purpose, and despite the frequent drops in framerate in the most agitated situations, it is easy to keep the action under control and the collisions between the characters, as well as the contact with the ball, are convincing. Pleasant is the realization of the replays, which through a touch screen interface, allow a rather free management of the camera, being able to move the angle and rotate the shot as desired to better review the most spectacular actions. On the other hand, the audio sector is really poor: the accompanying music is confirmed at the limit of the bearable (they have never shined in this series, on the other hand), while during the match the sound effects seem to have taken weight from the old football games of the 90s: without comment (apart from the classic ~goal!~), with woody noises to underline tackles, shots and rebounds and the cheering that appears at times when approaching the warm areas of the field and then eventually explodes in the characteristic ~open shower effect~ in case of network. Note the always very permissive refereeing, probably linked precisely to a technical limit in the exploitation of the CPU by the game: many fouls take place quietly with impunity on the field, sometimes compromising the very course of the match, with the referee intervening only in most striking cases. On the other hand, the limitation in the management of artificial intelligence is also demonstrated by the behavior of the opponents controlled by the CPU: although at the higher difficulty levels the challenge is still demanding, there is a tendency towards the most elementary behavior possible, without particular constructions tactics in both offense and defense. This can also lead to the discovery of certain strut weaknessesturals that can lead us to easily undermine the opposing defensive lines, and to score goals regularly by performing certain actions. Comment Comparing Pro Evolution Soccer 6 DS to the general situation of football videogame simulations, this version clearly represents an involution compared to the results achieved by other titles, and above all by the same game for other consoles. The choice implemented by Konami, to keep the game structure and the feeling of the series practically unchanged also on Nintendo DS, on the one hand can easily bring PES enthusiasts closer together, but on the other it necessarily entails a poor exploitation of the specific capabilities of the console and indeed a highlighting of the technical limits of the hardware. On the other hand, it is one of the few football simulations for the Nintendo laptop, and that is enough to be taken into consideration by a large number of users, and in any case it is a portable version (reduced, of course, but with all the advantages of being pocket-sized) decent than a game itself that is well structured. It doesn't contain great stimuli for long gaming sessions, but it fits well with its nomadic essence by offering immediate fun for short games, and obviously sees the fun increase with multiplayer gaming, which can count on well-functioning online support. The (relative) realism and good physics applied to the ball complete the picture of an enjoyable game, no more, which will hopefully act as a springboard for the series on the Nintendo DS. Pros: It's a soccer simulation on the Nintendo DS! Good behavior of the ball Online multiplayer present and functioning Cons: Prehistoric graphics Sound almost absent Not very fun in single In the end, Konami realized that the Nintendo DS user base cannot be orphaned by one of its greatest hits, and decided to remedy the matter. In fact, so far EA has been free to maintain the dominance of football simulations on the dual Nintendo screen, avoiding that eternal challenge between FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer which has been regularly proposed on all other consoles for years now, and football on the laptop of the big N has been matched up to now with the simulation by Electronic Arts. With a certain delay, and in spite of the devastating financial results recorded by Nintendo DS particularly in Japan, but also in the rest of the world, Konami has therefore also deployed the new chapter of Pro Evolution Soccer on this console: the sixth, even if the it actually takes on little meaning in the context, given that it is in all respects the first to arrive on DS, and that it has very little to do with the homonymous released on home consoles. This game proposes, in a somewhat amplified way, the usual problem that afflicts all cross-platform titles that reach Nintendo DS: how to fit all the technical ambaradan that a current generation game entails within the small hardware of the laptop? Konami has decided on perhaps the most questionable route, at least as regards the optimal exploitation of the console, or rather trying to insert the same game as the home consoles into the small cartridge, with the same structure and obvious showy cuts where the relatively poor computational capacity of Nintendo DS could not arrive.", "date": "2007-06-25", "grade": null}
