As we had already noticed in the beta testing phase, the game is direct and faithful to the line of pure, fast and no-frills fun. Although it has a considerable depth, this title does not bother to take care of the aspects related to the role-playing philosophy that often infects the most savvy RPG players. The game mechanism is simple and built around the need to provide the public with a product capable of guaranteeing maximum enjoyment in the best possible way and above all in the shortest possible time. The great worries of the MMORPG developers in recent years have been, in fact, those of guaranteeing play space for any player and avoiding that scourge that has always marginalized the player who has just landed on the server, subjecting him to the overwhelming power of the hardcore players. The question to ask is in fact the following. Is it possible to synthesize in a videogame product the desire to guarantee a massive multiplayer gaming experience and the need to preserve the ludic enjoyment even for those players who don't dedicate an inordinate amount of hours to the game? Before finding an answer to this crucial question it is necessary to understand its intrinsic importance. MMORPG, we hope not to be redundant, means creating and ensuring the presence of a persistent virtual world in which a community of gamers can flourish, possibly creating, with its very presence, new game stimuli in order to make the offer always different and tempting. In this order, at the dawn of the phenomenon, the hated and loved philosophy of PvP was born, which provided for the possibility of direct clashes between players. This type of approach to the game, obviously, forcibly excluded the occasional player, the one on Sunday afternoon, or the hour in peace after work and before dinner, subjecting him to the law of the strongest and thus crushing the experience under the aegis of the protectorate by self-styled clans or guilds. The solution came, albeit not quickly, by cutting the bull's head off and skipping the problem of interaction between incompatible players by level and experience. The instanced quest, Egg of Columbus Starting from the assumptions analyzed above, DDO presents itself to the public with the important stance of putting before the problem of the growth of the characters and the advancement of occasional players looking for short but comprehensive online gaming experiences, the instantiated. Instantiated quests mean entering a persistent online world made up of areas whose access is governed by character status. DDO presents itself to the public with the important stance of putting before the problem of the growth of the characters and the advancement of occasional players looking for short but comprehensive online gaming experiences The instanced quest, Egg of Columbus In other words, while the city areas interest all the players who can tread the ground, as well as the taverns and points used for commercial exchanges, once a quest is activated and you reach the place where it will come to life, you will find yourself magically in a place dedicated to the player, or to the party to which he will belong, to live the real player-friendly gaming experience. Although sometimes we tend to distance the trivial truth, upon a more in-depth analysis we will realize that an MMORPG with instanced quests is nothing more than a hybrid between MMORPG and RPG in multiplayer. In fact, the ~common~ world is trodden by all the players who have logged in to a given game server, the ~rooms~ instead are the scene of party adventures. Warforged yes, Artificers no Eberron is the setting that Wizards Of The Coast (current publisher of D&D, now a branch of Hasbro) has chosen for this new consecration of D&D on the altar of great videogame projects. Having set aside for once the classic universe of the Forgotten Realms is one of the main novelties of this latest D&D production. Eberron is a high-magical world where the classic social and racial order known from D&D is slightly revolutionized. In addition to the numerous differences in terms of the plot (consisting of a totally new story and disconnected from that of the Forgottem Realms), the new setting offers a new playable race, the Warforged, and a new class, that of the Artificers. Although the release of the Eberron manual dates back to just over a handful of months ago, only the first of these important innovations has been introduced in the videogame adaptation made in DDO. The Artificer class, a kind of item charmer capable of applying their own overpowersmagical skills on the creation of enchanted objects, has been set aside for the moment, probably due to the difficult surrender that would have resulted from a videogame transposition so devoted to action. The Warforged race is already the master on the servers, offering an even more imaginative alternative to the classic Half-Orc Warforged yes, Artificers no The Warforged race, on the other hand, already dominates the servers, proposing an even more imaginative alternative to the classic Half-Orc. In fact, these gigantic magical metal and wood constructs cover the role of ~beater~ race in the world of Eberron, divinely lending themselves to those uses in which the use of hands and brute force is indispensable. This makes the Warforged a race dedicated to Warrior or Barbarian activities, while not excluding any other employment. The bad guys out! One of the further peculiarities of the game is that it does not present the possibility of playing characters with an evil alignment. Having noticed this peculiarity initially left us disoriented. Nonetheless, we think we have correctly interpreted the will of the developers, believing that this choice was made to preserve the linear structure of the game and completely bypass the issue concerning PvP. In a game in which direct confrontation between players is excluded a priori, it would in fact make no sense to provide the participants with the pretext for creating enmities linked to the orientation of the characters. DDO's philosophy is entirely oriented towards the collaboration between characters aimed at pursuing the common goal, namely the repression of the evil forces that rage on the regions of the planet. Even the structure of the quests, which provides for an equal plot for each player, must be able to follow this script, and for this reason there is no reason to follow the development of the events in a different way. DDO's philosophy is entirely oriented towards the collaboration between characters aimed at pursuing the common goal, namely the repression of the evil forces that rage on the regions of the planet The bad guys out! In fact, this series of choices has led the title to move far away from pure RPG, which at this point remains a distant mirage. DDO is very much a title based on action, rather than on the interpretation of the character, and in summary it could almost be defined as an MMOG. MMOGs and RP? Of D&D persist the peculiarities related to the creation of the character, the management of environmental interactions, combat, casting spells and activating skills. After all, the role-playing aspect has been completely or almost abandoned, relegating it to a simple playful context. The character is in fact immersed in a world permeated with typical elements of the classic RPG, starting from the story and the dialogues proposed by the bots scattered on the map, but this does not find continuity between the players who interact with each other only in order to form a party competitive enough to tackle the next dungeon to strip. At this point, let's go back to the already analyzed concept according to which DDO should not be experienced as a massive RPG experience, but as an immense, finely structured Action Game, which offers the possibility of organizing real multiplayer game campaigns alongside other players. Wow is an exclamation! And it really makes me want to say it. From the technical side DDO really leaves you breathless. To the detriment of a graphic engine that is not always light, especially in the moments dedicated to loading the area and consequent swapping, the final result on a latest generation machine is nothing short of spectacular. The light effects, transparencies and particle animations, as well as the presence of high-quality textures make total immersion in the game world possible. Some criticism should be made more than anything else to the creation of the command interface, especially that relating to skills and spells, which is not very adaptable and dynamic; there is often the risk of confusion and resorting to the wrong skill. The simplification-based combat mode leaves a huge chunk of success in battle to the player's dexterity; the resulting result is that, when camera management doesn't get in the way, you can easily knock out an opponent of equal power. from the technical side DDO really leaves you breathless The choice of wanting to anticipate entry into the areas used for quests with audio tracks containing agitated readings of the atmosphere as if to give voice to an improbable omnipresent Dungeon Master makes us smile. DDO is a constantly evolving world, and there is no shortage of constant updates. The latest arrival in this sense, egpious, guarantees a deeper gaming experience by greatly expanding the accessible game areas, adding new plot twists and the imposing presence of draconic creatures ready to roast our adventurers. Considering the young age of the game, these initiatives bode well for a future of continuous renewal that will always give new life to the gaming experience. Final comment Following a close contact with DDO, and a long-lasting gaming experience that has led us to follow the game since the beta testing phases, we can express the most impartial judgment possible for this long-awaited title. At this point, an editorial dilemma arises. If we had to vote for the role-playing game itself, or a title that boasts the D&D brand with such honor, we would necessarily have to scrape the lowest rungs of the rankings. So let's be clear once and for all, in our opinion it is difficult to find a profound component in the sense of RPG in DDO. Nonetheless, what we have before our eyes is a valid game from every other point of view, first of all, and it is no small thing when it comes to video games and therefore entertainment, from the point of view of fun. DDO is a game oriented more on action than interpretation. What DDO brings home is a largely positive judgement, weighed down only by a few stains which, in our opinion, have distanced the highest steps of the classification, remembering that it is the sacrosanct right of every player to play for fun and DDO guarantees both fun and it is guaranteed for every level of player and related, from time to time, to the player's direct experience. And that's not much. Pros Graphically impeccable You enter the action in a short time Action for every need Cons The RPG essence is almost missing Graphically impeccable... but the engine sometimes stumbles Game interface not always close to the user We have finally arrived at the long awaited moment. D&D Online is ready to take the field and confront the main rivals in the battle for the biggest share of the MMORPG market. Just over a week has passed since the official opening of the first European servers and we didn't miss the opportunity to get our hands on a valid copy for entry into this virtual world made up of magical heists and underground exploration.", "date": "2006-03-20", "grade": null}
