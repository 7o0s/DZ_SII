{"name": "Macross M3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/macross-m3.html", "text": "Mechs are back in fashion Unfortunately this trend has not yet taken off and, as often happens, we are faced with mediocre titles that exploit easy licenses, hoping to attract the greatest number of buyers by showing off famous names. Even Macross M3 does not escape this modus operandi and sorry to say, the idea that programmers still today are not able to make the most of SEGA hardware is not acceptable, especially after having seen titles of the caliber of Shen Mue and Soul Calibur, only to name two of the best known. The version I tested is obviously the Japanese one since there is still no talk of PAL conversion. This is not a huge problem since the game is basically a mech shooter seen from behind, and the story can be guessed even without knowing how to read the kanji. Macross enthusiasts will surely be able to interpret the events better than myself, so I will limit myself to a purely technical observation of the product. A robot for everyone Initially we are offered a mediocre presentation made with a polygonal engine different from that of the real game and interspersed with cartoon scenes that do not blend well with the CG. Arrived at the main menu we are offered the possibility to choose between four options: the story mode, a free mission, the connection with the large network and finally the classic configuration mode. The story mode begins with a static cartoon-style presentation followed by the mission briefing, or by the explanation of the mission's purpose. Before starting the actual game we are asked to choose the mech we want to drive; obviously only one vehicle will be available for the first mission, but going forward you will be able to choose from several models (about 8, obviously excluding the secret ones ....) which will greatly influence the continuation of the game. I say this because, just to give an example, already from the second level if you choose the robot that is unlocked you take part in a mission let's say ~terrestrial~, while if you continue to use the initial one you find yourself in a level equal to the first , i.e. set completely in the sky. What am I turning into today? As already mentioned, the game is a classic 3D shooter, like Ace Combat, with your vehicle in the foreground, a single shot and the ability to move freely in all directions. Graphically speaking, the title is mediocre, with poor backdrops and poorly defined and quite simple textures. The degree of detail is in fact below average with mechs that are poorly characterized and sometimes jerky in their movements. Even the characterization of the enemies is not exciting, on the contrary ... I repeat and I will never get tired of saying it, how is it possible that even today, about three years after the marketing of the SEGA jewel, there are still programmers who are unable to squeeze the console deeply?! For example, there is one thing that shouldn't happen on a machine with DC potential, that is the frequent appearance of very annoying slowdowns in the event of agitated clashes with many mechs, which greatly damage the playability, raising the level quite a lot. of gamer frustration. However, the possibility of changing the shape of your vehicle at any time (in pure Macross style of course) respectively into: jet, half robot and half plane and finally only robots is nice. These transformations obviously affect the game tactics, but the slow response of the command system ruins everything, making the action often confusing and almost giving the impression that one's alter ego is only in name but not in fact. For enthusiasts... The difficulty is within the norm without ever going beyond either frustration (apart from the slowdowns ....) or too much simplicity. The music is nice and catchy but nothing more. Finally, if we add the lack of involvement and the flatness of the missions, one can only say that the game certainly suffers from a hasty and superficial programming that binds it to an audience of fans of the Macross series. For all the others, I recommend viewing it from your trusted dealer, especially given the fact that the game is only Japanese and you know, the yen costs ......! Dreamcast finished? Despite the premature ~death~ of the very valid SEGA console, Dreamcast games are still coming out, and they will certainly come out in the future, both in order not to abandon the millions of users in possession of the white box, and because the hypothesis of a possible compatibility with the X-BOX has been mooted (let's remember that the Dreamcast is compatible with Windows CE), which will certainly give new life to Dreamcast's videogame production and will push the software houses to produce games always on top of the situation", "date": "2001-04-02", "grade": null}
