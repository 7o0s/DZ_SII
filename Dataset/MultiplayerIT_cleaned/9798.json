Hybrids between single and multiplayer enriched by online components that offer the possibility of playing for free, facilitating the experience through microtransactions for a few euros. Obviously EA has also landed in force to assault this new frontier of PC video gaming which, although not a certain investment, as we have seen with Tiger Woods, has given several surprises including D&D Online, reborn thanks to this formula, and the recent Need For Speed Online, which started for a fee when it reached one million users, has also opened access to a free mode. And if there's a title that can crunch numbers and survive thanks to microtransactions, it's definitely Fifa Online. It is no coincidence that EA Sports has spent a lot of resources creating a game that certainly does not live up to the classic series but is pleasant to look at and very rich in terms of content. In fact, Fifa Online allows us to manage a team to play both in single player and in multiplayer through single matches, friendlies, special events and real tournaments that include the world cup. All surrounded by now classic elements of the genre such as friends list, matchmaking and chat rooms. All football minute by minute Fifa Online is played on the field, at the tip of the mouse, and is based on gaining experience to increase the rating of the team and of the players who can equip items and level up as in an RPG. Certainly it is not particularly realistic to see Del Piero increasing his skills at 35 but it is a solution capable of increasing the complexity and longevity of the title. But it is not possible to win relying only on one's own skills, in fact the managerial component is essential to be competitive both in single player and in multiplayer mode. Among the management elements, the most relevant is the division of the finances that we can earn by winning games, or by paying with real money in the final version, and which allow us first of all to instantly recover energy from the players and pay their salary to avoid inopportune abandonments . Furthermore, on the occasion of particularly difficult matches, it is advisable to purchase some bonuses which enhance a specific sector of the team by some points. The maximum number of bonuses that can be equipped for the team is 6 but each player can wear specific items of clothing that can give him personal boosts that add up to those of the team. Obviously, to circulate the money and make purchases of virtual currency with real money attractive, the objects last 5 games and disappear, furthermore the players' energy drops very quickly and the difficulty rises just as quickly. Thankfully, while we don't know how the monetary issue will be balanced in the final version, there are some shortcuts that allow you to remain competitive without squeezing the team's finances. In fact, the victories, of normal and special matches, which allow us to win objects and to unlock, for each dominated match, a purchasable player randomly drawn from three possibilities. Furthermore, careful management of the transfer market and the team's academy allow us to bring home good players, and there are 15,000 to choose from, without spending a fortune. But it is also possible to rely on luck by purchasing the packs: closed boxes of 400, 800 or 2400 coins which may contain useless or already owned objects but also special items and bonuses of a value higher than the cost of the package. Undoubtedly we are faced with a rich title that does not lack massive support for the online part. The Fifa Online experience is in fact enriched by special events such as Happy Hours and Live Events. The former are periods of time in which winning specific challenges, such as a 1vs1 game or a multiplayer tournament, guarantees greater bonuses such as gaining double experience and double game prize. Live Events, on the other hand, are special matches that compare two teams chosen by the guys from EA Sports and can be played by all Fifa Online players. The sum of wins and losses from all games played decides which team will win and which players will get the match rewards. Extremely intuitive Fifa Online can also be played with the keyboard but there is no doubt that the timing and type of game have been shaped with the mouse in mind. In short, a desk football, less frenetic than the classic Fifa and easier to manage. And even this setting results in slower reactions as Fifa Online is unbeatable for intuitiveness. When one of our players has possession of the ball, just click the s button onceleft to make a pass close to the ground, by holding it down instead it is possible to lift the ball from the ground and cross while with the right button you shoot. The cursor allows you to select the precise point where to shoot, the player to pass the ball to or where to launch through balls, never so precise before, and also allows us to select a player when we don't have control of the ball. To run, simply move the pointer away from the player and to discard it's all a matter of pulse and timing. Even the game mechanics are simple and stick to the classic canons of the series. Shooting on the run is more wasteful and difficult and to cross on the fly you run towards the baseline and change direction suddenly by lifting the ball. To steal the ball you can simply carry it away by hovering over it or activate tackle mode by holding down the left button or risk a right-click tackle to blow it away from a flying attacker. So we can say that Fifa Online has it all, albeit implemented in a different and somewhat more naive way. Certainly the technical degree and the complexity of the physics are much simpler than the Fifa 11 counterparts but overall the experience is good and offers an exceptional variety of goals, thanks to the possibility of aiming directly at the point where to shoot using the pointer of the mouse. Work in progress Fifa Online is an experiment and is still completely free. Therefore, changes regarding the management component are not excluded, especially as a function of microtransactions, when the title comes out of beta. Also missing are several tournaments, formations and statistics from the 2010/2011 season, a complete player trading market and a whole series of prizes and achievements that will be implemented with the next updates. It should be emphasized that matchmaking will also be optimized and refined to reduce waiting times and find players who are as compatible as possible with our skill level. Pros and cons Regarding the difficulty, initially the computer is all too simple to beat and the goalkeeper's ducks are wasted but, after the tenth level of difficulty out of the twenty available, the degree of challenge becomes demanding and the artificial intelligence grows making the defenses less vulnerable and the less rash CPU-controlled players. Plus the multiplayer challenges aren't almost never simple to deal with and will become increasingly complex with the growth of the manual skill of the players and the level of the teams. On the playability side, the slowed changes of direction stand out, which are functional to the type of game but cause some problems during fast actions, especially when there is the need to stop a launched player. A situation in which we often find ourselves forced to commit a foul even when in theory the situation should have been resolved cleanly. Furthermore, the rule of advantage seems to be automatic and it is a choice that makes some situations too fake. Also worth noting are some flaws in relation to collisions that often show players who clash rigidly, almost as if they were ducks in a bathtub. But of course we must remember that Fifa Online is free and that despite the spartan public and the glassy eyes of some players what is shown on the pitch is not bad. The player models are more than recognizable, the number of animations is high and there is no lack of celebrations, facial expressions of the players, spectacular replays and all the cameras necessary to make the football experience complete. And the scalability of the engine is also excellent, allowing you to reduce the graphics to a minimum and make the graphics engine digestible by rather dated systems. But the real surprise comes from the sound sector complete with commentary, albeit in English, accompanied by voices on the sidelines that are spoken in the language of the team we have chosen. Also, as icing on the cake, EA has surprised everyone with a soundtrack that lives up to the main EA Sports saga and is characterized by high quality original songs.", "date": "2010-09-20", "grade": "8.0"}
