This review covers the second and third, and is reasonably spoiler-free. Last note: the rating is not an average of the two episodes but evaluates the series up to the point it has reached as we write. Since a lot of time has passed since the review of the first chapter, let's take an overview of the series, now that it has reached the central point. Dreamfall Chapters proceeds on two narrative tracks separated in space and time but destined to cross: that of Kian and that of Zoe. Kian lives in a medieval steampunk, while Zoe is a citizen of a cyberpunk metropolis. Kian is a rebel and a fugitive, a traitor to his own people, while Zoe is a smart and wealthy girl who ends up unwillingly embroiled in a history of corruption and intrigue. However, both find themselves fighting from below against the dictatorship and its armed wing, in Kian's case the army, in Zoe's the economy. Control and oppression are recurring themes in the two narrative lines, which have many points in common and in some ways are a reflection of each other. But what makes Dreamfall Chapters so fascinating is the addition of a third global, dreamlike, surreal, often cryptic plot that envelops the stories of Kian and Zoe. How these narratives are related to each other is still a mystery. Furthermore, to complicate matters further, a third character is added, a little girl named Saga, born from the union of a human man and a woman with magical powers. We only discover something about her in the course of brief interludes between the stories of Kian and Zoe and her role on the chessboard of events is currently indecipherable. From a narrative point of view, Dreamfall Chapters is therefore very ambitious, especially if we think that the player has the opportunity to make decisions that have serious repercussions on the stories of the characters. The system of choices is enriched by the possibility of listening to the reflections of Kian and Zoe on each of the possible decisions. These brief internal dialogues give us important insights into Kian and Zoe's character and the nature of the dilemmas they face. The game also takes care of telling us at the end of a chapter and at the beginning of the next what was the reason for our decisions and how much they are weighing on the story. Sometimes even a text appears while we play to warn us that what is happening on the screen derives from a decision we have made previously. We therefore feel the weight of destiny that changes under the blows of our will, although at the moment it does not seem to have caused cataclysms of any kind. Maybe our freedom is more illusory than we think, or maybe only in the end we will be able to review our past and understand where it has led us. What matters is that the choices are perceived as meaningful. Up to here we are however still in the realm of games like The Walking Dead or Life is Strange. Where Dreamfall Chapters really stands out is in the amount of missions the characters have to go through. There is therefore a world to explore and plenty to do. So let's go in order and start with the second episode, the least successful of those published so far. Dreamfall Chapters is a narrative world worth exploring in every branch Pony Express The second episode of the series is a jammed engine. After his escape from prisons, Kian encounters resistance, but none of the characters who join his journey stand out for their originality. Above all, we fail to clearly understand what are the personal motivations that drive him to action. Sculpted physique, character forged in steel and face of marble, Kian seems like a mere tool in the hands of the rebels, but this external solidity contrasts with his inner world. We would like to get to know him better, but instead the torments of this warrior monk's soul are not expressed. Adding to the feeling of detachment is the fact that we spend most of our time as delivery boys. Take this and that, discover the traitor, blow up the weapon crates; all in no particular order, as if we were walking around the shelves of a supermarket with a shopping list in hand. The entrance of a mysterious red-haired woman dressed as an RPG thief doesn't improve the situation of the cast, who have already seen enough clichs. The only character who resolves the situation is the Mole, who, however, has a secondary role, however touching. Unfortunately we also lose touch with Zoe's narrative line, afflicted like Kian by a series of missions that force her to traipse up and down from one refuge to another in search ofi a little girl, visiting scenarios that are too similar to each other. Furthermore, both in the city of Zoe and in that of Kian, which we see here for the first time, the pleasure of discovery is replaced by the frustration of not knowing where to go. It must be admitted that when the story finds some space, the cosmic breath that had conquered us in the first episode still transpires, but the predominant feeling is that of two separate games, the narrative interaction on one side and the action on the other. inside the scenario on the other. If we want to look for a strong point in the second episode we have to turn to the topics covered. Genocide and racism are linked to the plots of power that we began to discover in the first chapter and expand the gray area in which the characters must make their moral choices. Unfortunately, all this stops at the level of exposure. We talk about it, we tell facts, but when it's time to take action, we put our courier uniform back on and go back to making deliveries. Fortunately, everything changes with the third chapter. Finally big In the third chapter, the series finally embraces its potential to the fullest. The pace of the narrative increases, as does the movement of the story, less expository and more focused on staging the themes and conflicts that have been fueled up to that moment. It can be said that Kian and Zoe finally go on the attack, taking on the responsibility that fate has entrusted to them. Continuing to maintain an interesting parallel between the stories of the two characters, the game shows us the time that has passed through the look of Kian and Zoe. The former has put on a little beard and hair, which make him less grim and remote, while the young girl of the future has a fashionable cut which, on the contrary, rejuvenates her but also makes her more self-confident, taking away from her that respectable air that he carried with him. The aspect therefore reflects the emotional evolution of the two protagonists, who we don't just wait to see one in front of the other to find out what planetary upheaval will result from their meeting. The good news is that it may not be long. In fact, Zoe finally decides to use the dream machine, and when she does, she finds herself in none other than Marcuria, the city where Kian's story takes place. With an elegant touch of direction, the game shows us how the two characters miss each other by a whisker, surprisingly and logically at the same time. There is no place for chance and shortcuts in the third chapter. The writers have done an excellent job of bringing out the personalities of the two protagonists, which are finally readable in their desires. Kian has emerged from the glacial shell of indifference and Zoe is more determined than ever to get to the bottom of it and get the answers she seeks. It took many hours of gameplay and two episodes to set the stage, but now the main characters lead the narrative without hesitation. To make the gaming experience even more satisfying is the ease with which the consequences of the choices made in the previous chapters are understood. In order to make them so clear, the writers had to make them perhaps a little obvious, but it is a good compromise compared to the vagueness of other similar games, and helps us to enter even deeper into the game world. And speaking of setting, the scenario is finally opening up to new horizons. Zoe explores a vast network of never-before-seen environments while Kian's story offers us the chance to enjoy the game's first panoramic view. It is as if the series has broken a dam, thus exploring previously unknown territories, both in the geography of the places and in the inner map of the characters. The only weak point remain the missions. Even if the deliveries by deliveryman have given way to more intelligent puzzles, their simplicity clashes with the thickness of the narrative sector. At the end of the episode, however, we both felt the sense of satisfaction for the hours of intense narration experienced and the anxiety of knowing where Kian and Zoe's stories will take us. If the developers continue to be receptive to criticism and courageous in writing, Dreamfall Chapters could become a new adventure classic.", "date": "2015-07-17", "grade": "8.0"}
