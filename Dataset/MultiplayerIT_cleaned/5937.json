The Dark Gods have finally united behind a common goal, to unleash their madness upon the world as never before. [...] And so, as the Chaos moon, Morrslieb, shines full in the sky, echoes of shrill cries resound in the tunnels under the Imperial cities, from which a gigantic horde of Skaven emerges.The event occurs first in the city of Ubersreik, with a a squealing mass that consumes everything in its path and quickly transforms the place into an ossuary, buried under the evil shadow of the god of rats~. This is the incipit of Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide, the cooperative action game developed by Fatshark under license from Games Workshop. In a seemingly desperate situation, with a huge army of anthropomorphic mice intent on destroying everything, five heroes stand up to defend the world: the witch hunter Victor Saltzpyre, the witch of light Sienna Feugonasus, the dwarf ranger Bardin Goreksson, the sentinel elf Kerillian and Imperial soldier Markus Kruber. Each of them is moved by different motivations and their nature is often conflicting, but they find themselves united in the fight against the Skaven and our task will be to help them prevent the end of time. Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide is a fast-paced and fun cooperative action game Five heroes, an avalanche of monsters Do you know Left 4 Dead? Well, because Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide actually represents a reinterpretation of the same formula, in this case with a focus on melee rather than on ranged attacks, present but not predominant in terms of gameplay. Certainly the five selectable characters - one of which, however, is destined to remain out of the game, as multiplayer is limited to four participants - are very different and boast precise peculiarities that make the approach effectively unique depending on the choice made. The Imperial soldier, who we often preferred during the tests due to the extraordinary power of his warhammer, can also equip sword and shield and change the secondary weapon, switching from a wide dispersion rifle to more precise tools, so as to hit even distant targets. The witch, Sienna Feugonasus, on the other hand, does not need ammunition for her fire projectiles, with which she can burn enemies, but which require a ~cooling down~ maneuver to prevent the flames from damaging her, while the sword she wields reveals itself equally effective for decapitating Skaven and lopping off their limbs. The dwarf ranger Bardin, as expected, is a marvel from short distances and his ax really hurts, as is the precise shot of his crossbow, while Kerillian, belonging to the body of the Waywatcher, is infallible with the bow and very fast in lunges with the double dagger. Finally, the witch hunter knows how to assert himself by hitting his opponents with his double pistol and brandishing a large sword. Different approaches, we said, which however are not difficult to assimilate in a few minutes, and which significantly increase the variety of a gameplay that does not struggle to conquer, proving to be very simple in its prerogatives: finding the right path in the scenarios and killing giant rats in large quantities. ~Beat the hammer, I take who I take!~ If in Left 4 Dead there were situations where you had to flip a switch and then resist a large wave of undead, the same happens in Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide, even if the emphasis on melee makes these situations different . In one of the missions, for example, you have to defend four magical banners from the attack of rats, in another, transport explosive barrels along a route to blow up structures, in yet another, grab supplies and put them safely on a cart. before escaping. The similarities with the title produced by Valve, however, do not end there: there are special classes of Skaven that can capture team members and damage them until someone saves them, but also units equipped with chemical bombs or powerful Gatling guns, to be taken down as quickly as possible to avoid taking too much damage. And then yes, there are also the tanks, in this case gigantic anthropomorphic rats that descend with fury on the battlefield, charging the heroes and slamming their fists on the ground to cause dangerous shockwaves. In theory, the numbers of the Fatshark product on paper are more substantial, with thirteen different missions instead of four, to be unlocked as we complete those initially available and with varying degrees of difficulty, but their structure is not episodic and therefore the final number of hours could be identical. Some room has been given to looting and crafting, with each character being able to carry three items (a medkit, a potion and a bomb) and gain extra equipment at the end of the levels (randomly, but not too much). , to be used, upgraded, fused into a new weapon or simply resold for currency. This aspect of the experience substantially changes the ~look & feel~ of the five heroes, who can therefore fight wielding heavy or light weapons, lend themselves to impact or precision maneuvers, depending on what we think best suits the our style or with the needs of a specific mission. In terms of pure gameplay, the rendering of melee is in some cases a bit slippery and it would perhaps have been possible to enhance the impacts more, but considering all the elements involved, one cannot complain and it is not even possible to slash at head down without covering, as it will take very little for the enemies to take advantage of a moment in which we are discovered. The best strategy therefore remains to strike by calculating the times well, raise your guard, possibly push away your opponents and then repeat, perhaps taking out your rifle to quickly shoot down some targets. Give it to the mouse It is interesting to note how the Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide beta has attracted players who are already quite expert, who know the dynamics of the levels and therefore know when it is time to advance and when instead it is wiser to hide and fall back, where to position oneself during waves and what is the location of supplies. If you happen to have one or more of these users in your team, the bulk is done, while naturally finding yourself playing with newbies or, even worse, people who think they are invincible and always leave the group, without providing support where necessary, can make the very frustrating stuff. By default the matchmaking works very well, matches start early and we noticed very few latency issues. As always for multiplayer titles, however, the best thing is to get organized with friends and structurally tackle the various missions together. For the rest, the judgment on the game is very positive but not enthusiastic due to a general lack of originality, combined with the use of effective but now obsolete mechanics (Left 4 Dead was released seven years ago), and a series of shortcomings in terms of refinement, specifically polygonal interpenetrations that lead to unpleasant situations (an enemy who has grabbed us with a pole but who is on the other side of a wall and therefore cannot be hit, for example), an ugly interface , an obviously basic artificial intelligence (but it's there, after all we are fighting against a horde of mice) and graphics devoid of personality, which is based on generic assets and meager animations, therefore struggling to hit and aiming solely at functionality. The music, on the other hand, is beautiful, but it happens that we listen to it too rarely: it would have been appropriate to enhance it.", "date": "2015-10-27", "grade": "8.0"}
