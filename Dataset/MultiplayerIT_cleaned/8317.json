In fact, with the advent of the Epic title, a more mature product arrives on a smartphone for the first time, created with tools born entirely in the gaming field (the versatile Unreal Engine) and destined to be considered much more than a pastime that drives away thoughts. Since then, the panorama has evolved even more and both on smartphones and tablets we have seen increasingly refined technical and gameplay solutions, such as to convince (almost) all the previous detractors of these platforms. Precisely in the illustrious groove traced by the best seller Infinity Blade (and its sequel) stands Infinite Warrior, yet another fantasy reinterpretation of the fight between good and evil by Empty Flask Games. Next Infinite Warrior can easily be classified as an ~endless running~ game, however much more action-oriented; in fact, it is already clear from the title that there is no official end to the main adventure but, as always happens in these cases, to unlock the next level it is sufficient to reach the pre-set intermediate objectives. The story that, in a very weak way, accompanies the events narrated refers to the return of an unspecified ferocious tyrant, eager for revenge and for this reason the author of a massacre among the troops of the kingdom. Obviously the only remaining survivor will be the protagonist of the game, a formidable fighter capable of knocking down entire enemy garrisons by himself. Beyond the undoubted paucity of the narrative, once the application is started we will be immediately catapulted into the battlefield, on which the warrior automatically moves forward. The interactivity with the player is essentially resolved in two moments, one linked to the actual combat, which is carried out with a simple slide of the finger in the direction indicated by the arrow on the screen, and the other in the collection of coins and gems scattered along the way. Both input systems are essentially borrowed from Infinity Blade but, compared to the Epic masterpiece and although the protagonist is always on the move, the sensation transmitted is that of a lesser general dynamism. In fact, combat is reduced to a single movement of the finger, always following the indication that appears in the center of the screen; once you learn the right timing, you essentially witness a series of increasingly violent but almost mechanical and absolutely no bite killings. In fact, it was useless to recreate, thanks to motion capture sessions, realistic and truthful assaults with white weapons if the game interaction is so limited; a timed slide is equivalent to a kill, without variables of any kind, bonus scores, etc. The differences with Infinity Blade are therefore marked, although both games share the same concept; in that case, in fact, you fight standing still but at least the duels last longer and offer some variations, which unfortunately is not present in Infinite Warrior. The money collected allows some upgrades to weapons and armor, above all useful for lightening the equipment and therefore making movements faster, and to pay for access rights to subsequent levels once the minimum standard objectives of the current one have been achieved. As can be easily understood, this second option leads to the usual in-app purchases, not essential but as always very useful if you want to save time accessing all the scenarios. Finally, a few words on the technical aspect, very good especially on the new versions of iOS devices and masterful, as already mentioned, in the animations and stop-motions present in case of spectacular killings. From the multiplayer front, nothing to report, apart from the possibility of comparing the statistics with Game Center friends.", "date": "2012-09-19", "grade": "5.8"}
