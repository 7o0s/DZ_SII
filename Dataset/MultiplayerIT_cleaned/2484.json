{"name": "Globetrotter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/globetrotter.html", "text": "Around the world! Globetrotter is a video game created by Deadline Games and distributed by Vision Park in which, in the role of a bold young man or a nice girl, you will have to climb the heights of the Globetrotter Club, becoming its president, even though at the beginning you are absolutely nobody. We start from Rome with the task of taking pictures of some famous places in our beautiful capital but it is only the beginning: if your climb to success goes as it should, you will also arrive in remote eastern islands, you will travel around America and so much more. Your photos, your commitment, will be well rewarded but beware of various factors: fatigue in the first place. To move from one part of the city to another, especially when you are starting out, you will have to walk a long way (on the map of each city), thus getting tired. Losing energy, at night it will be difficult to escape from some bad guys or you will need to rest in a hotel if the jet lag has exhausted you. As you walk here and there icons will appear on the map which will allow you, depending on the symbol bearing on these icons, to recover energy or money, a pity that it is not a very easy thing: as long as you are in Rome the questions will not be irresistibly difficult but when arrive, say, in the Galapagos Islands, it will be difficult for you to know everything about the religion, city, etc. Around the world! Unfortunately, as long as we talk about our art, our cities and so on, frustration does not take over but the total number of questions (4000) is of little use if the overwhelming majority of us Italians will give random answers in an abundant 70% of cases! Of course, those who persist will have acquired a not indifferent culture but knowing the Italian videogame people, very few will spend the infamous cent for Globetrotter. Again, the idea of visiting (for now virtually) places that perhaps one hopes to go in the future is attractive, but one must see for how long and with what intensity. Once you have started, the economic aspect also takes over: you go to the hotel to relax (if located, or rather, go over its icon on the map), you use the plane to get to your workplace earlier (there they are even metro and taxy) and so on. The questions are generally accompanied by beautiful photographs taken all over the world and are also 4000 while the photographic missions are a hundred. Graphically it was obvious that you shouldn't expect much so with a mid-range P2, 64 mb of ram, 4 mb accelerated video card (oh!) and 200 mb of hard disk space it already plays great. Longevity should settle on about sixty hours, ~upgradable~ by downloading extra missions from the manufacturer's website, which are currently in hiding. What's now? I don't know how much a product of this type can capture the attention of the average gamer... it's not a bad game, the fact is that I don't even know whether to call it a video game, in the strict sense imposed by ourselves gamers. There is, as far as I know, a playable demo of Globetrotter, so I advise those interested to try it if hesitant, it could turn out to be a surprise For true men of culture! Even before consoles, PCs, Japanese cartoons invaded a considerable amount of my time, the hours of leisure between one question and another in middle school were spent playing the most varied board games of which I had (I don't know anymore where they are, sigh) a more than decent collection. Among these stood out the Trivial Pursuit that I personally hated, as opposed to an exterminated amount of people who have consecrated it as a bestseller in that sector. It's true, for me going to school at the time was almost an obligation imposed by the upper echelons of the family but going forward things have changed drastically, so much so that before going to sleep I'll soon read a song of the Divine (adjective added only in followed by Boccaccio) Dante's Comedy, for pure pleasure certainly not for imminent examination. All this preamble served to introduce the group of gamers who might feel attracted by the Globetrotter here, certainly not attractive to those who are only looking for dungeons to explore, monsters to slaughter or prefer to spend their time in an arena happily fragging their friends.", "date": "2001-06-15", "grade": null}
