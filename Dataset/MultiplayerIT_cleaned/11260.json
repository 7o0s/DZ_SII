{"name": "Sonic ai Giochi Olimpici", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sonic-ai-giochi-olimpici_a.html", "text": "It's truly an ~Olympic~ year for SEGA, which has so far taken full advantage of the official license of the Beijing Olympics, engaging their most popular characters in the operation. After Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, therefore, here is another spin-off that sees us control Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy in a series of races in which we don't collide with ~visible~ opponents, but with a series of records to beat. The comparison with Beijing 2008 is merciless for the official mobile game of the Olympics, which has practically half the number of sports compared to the SEGA title. For the rest, the basic setting is the same and draws heavily from the world of party games, whose accessible and immediate mechanics have been highly sought after by mobile video game developers for some months. In Sonic at the Olympic Games, however, each discipline makes its own story, perhaps with the same incipit but with a different development of the action depending on the specialization. There is only one game mode available, and it allows us to take part in running competitions over the 1500m, 400m hurdles, triple jump, discus throw and javelin throw. For all sports, a simple rule applies: we are in the Sonic universe, not in the real Olympics, and the laws that govern physics in this case are a little different. Let's take discus throwing for example: after loading the shot by pressing the 5 key when indicated on the screen, with greater precision which corresponds to greater power, we will see a bar fill up at the bottom of the screen. Once the disc has started, this bar will represent the energy available to make the launch regain altitude, useful for two fundamental reasons: firstly, the longer the disc remains in the air, the further away it will land; secondly, controlling the altitude of the launch will allow us to ~collect~ the rings scattered along the route. If the javelin throw takes place in rather similar ways, the discourse relating to the disciplines involving the race is different: after the judge has decreed the start (be careful not to start before...), we will have to press the 5 key corresponding to with the ~buttons~ that scroll along with the journey, gaining speed in direct proportion to our readiness. In the obstacle variant, this structure is enhanced by the presence of jump areas, positioned immediately before each obstacle: in this case we will have to press the joystick up at the right time, make the jump and collect the rings placed in the air. The four characters differ slightly in performance, e.g. Sonic is the fastest while Tails is better at jumping, etc. Each discipline has four different phases, for each of which you must ~qualify~ through a series of good performances. The technical realization of the game is discreet, functional to the action but far from exceptional. The sprites of the various characters are drawn faithfully and have a good set of animations, but don't expect fluid movements because the goal of the developers was clearly to make a product that runs on as many devices as possible, without excessive demands on hardware terms. The use of colors is good, the various locations have a fairly well-crafted scenario and scrolling takes place on different levels in parallax.
