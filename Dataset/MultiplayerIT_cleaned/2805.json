A little less often it happens that the developer is only one and that the video game itself is so ambitious as to attract the attention of the general public. Bright Memory's review talks about a title that was born from the intuition of a single Chinese developer who, with dedication and passion, undertook the creation of a first episode, before being placed in the spotlight and consequently deciding to transform it into something much broader Pending the release of Bright Memory Infinite, which will be launched on the market during 2021, that first particular episode arrives on the Xbox Series X, also turning into one of the very few launch exclusives of the new Microsoft console. We've played it and are ready to tell you what we think. A strange story Bright Memory is weird. There's no rain on this. We are still talking about a title that mixes multiple genres with passion and knowledge, tending to create a particular hybrid that recalls other games such as Shadow Warrior in many respects. Even the premises of the story are no different, lightly combining science fiction and folklore, futuristic elements with ancient ruins, even putting us in front of a series of frightening creatures, whether they are undead or werewolves . We play Sheila, a member of the SRO - Science Research Organization - a department dedicated to researching the supernatural. The premises are certainly not the best and it is immediately evident that our task will require us to prevent the undead, as well as dozens of other absurd creatures, from taking over and putting an end to the world as we know it. A 2036 that no one would clearly want to live in reality, but that Sheila will find herself facing with all her training and determination. There isn't much else to know regarding the incipit of this first episode, which will then be revived in some way in the Bright Memory Infinite reboot. It is to all intents and purposes a taste of what is to come, but which unfortunately ends even before being able to give its best, leaving the player eager for a continuation. An experience that realistically won't take you more than an hour to complete. We don't feel like obsessing over this detail, thanks to the work of a single person and the willingness to restart by improving everything on the basis of the accumulated experience, but perhaps we would have liked the price to be adjusted even further downwards compared to the 8 euros it costs. Stylish shooter Bright Memory is a mix of the passions of its own creator. Although it is possible to find in him some details of other games, such as the aforementioned Shadow Warrior, one cannot however hide the creative flair of those who have managed to unite so many distant elements together. The work almost immediately launches the player into the fray, with the risk of leaving him confused and not giving the opportunity to better perceive the mechanics, but it takes just a few minutes to understand the direction chosen by the developer and the will in terms of variety. Basically what you are asked is to shoot as much lead as possible at the handful of different types of different enemies, with the possibility of interspersing firearms with melee attacks and a series of skills to be unlocked as points accumulate experience. The whole system works fairly well, despite some approximations dictated by the production possibilities limited to Bright Memory's own development. In practice it is a question of interspersing combat with small exploratory phases, based on a basic and not at all brilliant level design. It is actually this aspect that really leaves us dumbfounded. Bright Memory tries to amaze by inserting within its stylish FPS system, made up of scores and votes based on one's own actions, also an interesting platforming and puzzle solving phase, but which translates into a series of elements that are not very amalgamated with each other and even mildly frustrating. Skills such as the prolonged jump, which is not very manageable, are of little use; or the grappling hook, with a very unintuitive range of use and management. In general, it is a journey that is far too short even just to sum up an almost non-existent variety and the creation of a couple of bosses that turn out to be simple and not very differentiated. It clearly doesn't help a shooting system with little feedback and a set of sketchy elements, as it is obvious for a first episode.AAt the same time we cannot hide our curiosity for the future of a project which could certainly offer surprises, above all in the light of a total overhaul and the probable raising of the bar, also and above all from the point of view of the budget used. It will only be at that point that we will be able to really judge the progression, the variety in fights and situations and above all the growth based on currently sketchy and approximate skill trees, which in some cases simplify the experience too much. A half technical disaster If all the rest of Bright Memory can be understood and the effort can be paid in some way, it is evident that from a technical point of view the problems are more pronounced. Beyond a not exactly very solid frame rate, which has the strange peculiarity of stabilizing with the passing of the minutes but which in the early stages is somewhat worrying, what really doesn't work is the console porting itself. We found it difficult believe it, to the point that in more than one we have tried to find a solution, but the reality seemed to us rather incontrovertible: the Xbox Series X version is literally the same one we have known for PC. This means that there is no real cursor dedicated to the pad, just as the game settings slavishly reproduce the graphics settings page of the PC version. Regardless of the size of the production, this type of lightness is in any case not very respectful towards the user who spends even just a handful of euros for the purchase. On the purely aesthetic front, it cannot be said that the commitment has not been there . The characterization of enemies, areas and bosses is interesting and successful, despite a polygonal count, especially for the models of the protagonist and some types of enemies, which clashes with arrogance with all the rest of the work carried out. Some elements of the soundtrack are interesting, which, however, is resolved quickly, in a few constantly repeated turns and which do not always accompany the action in the best possible way.", "date": "2020-11-11", "grade": "5.5"}
