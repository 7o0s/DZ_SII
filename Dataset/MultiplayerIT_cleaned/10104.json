In Space Miner: Space Ore Bust we find ourselves playing the role of a young and enterprising space miner, who goes aboard his spacecraft every day to a new sector of space in search of asteroids to crush. The gameplay of the new Venan product is clearly inspired by the classic Asteroids, with which it shares the central theme, but adds to the experience a huge load consisting of upgrades, licenses to be obtained, missions to be completed and a plot without a doubt interesting and engaging, told through text sequences that are very reminiscent of some famous video games of Japanese origin (Phoenix Wright, Super Robot Wars, etc.). Uncle Jeb's space station is our base, and it is from there that we can leave for new areas to ~clean up~, represented on the map in the form of square sectors complete with a percentage of completion. The action takes place in the most classic of ways, that is with our spacecraft which must shoot towards the asteroids to shatter them and then pass near the explosion to automatically collect the spilled minerals; all in an inertial context that requires a little patience during the early stages, but which after a few games no longer constitutes a limit for our movements, even when we have to move very quickly. Star sheriffs The gameplay based on the simple destruction of increasingly large and numerous asteroids, as well as on the collection of minerals, is gradually enriched by the arrival of new threats. At a certain point in the plot, in fact, a multinational company demands an enormous amount of money from Uncle Jeb and to pay off the debt it assumes the right to send its mining robots to work in the same sectors as us. To remedy this injustice we will be able to open fire against these automatons and destroy them to steal their ~harvest~, with a gradual increase in the difficulty that will be able to us in the more advanced missions to really have to better manage our ship and its defense systems. Our collection unit has limited space, so after a while we will necessarily have to leave the space sector we are cleaning up and return to the base to unload the minerals. The money earned in this way can be spent on boosters, harvesting systems, more powerful weapons and shields, as well as energy generators capable of running all our equipment (the consumption values of individual elements are indicated by a number) . Each add-on produces obvious effects right away: the enhanced weapons crumble the asteroids (or our enemies) with fewer shots, and in the same way the advanced collection systems manage to hook the minerals even from a certain distance. The game control system is completely based on the touch screen, with a virtual stick on the left side which determines the rotation of the spacecraft and two buttons on the right side which are used respectively to operate the thrusters and weapons. The inertial context to which we mentioned above constitutes a variable of no small importance in the economy of our movements, indeed it is a factor that must always be taken into due consideration: too much enthusiasm can make us crash into obstacles, to the detriment of our shields , and every shift must always be counterbalanced. This problem is particularly felt during some extra missions, when we have to approach objects on the map and stay in the same position for a few seconds. The hard life of the miner. Space. Although the gameplay is simple and sometimes repetitive, Space Miner: Space ore Bust amazes with the progression that is perceived when completing space sectors and moving towards new areas. The whole system of upgrades, with the various components that can be mounted or sold, is implemented very well and has the great merit of producing immediately visible results. Therefore, depending on our approach to the game, we can make our ship very fast and agile, focus on its offensive characteristics or invest all the money in collection systems to be able to extract minerals much faster. The extra missions, intertwined with a very nice and interesting storyline, succeed in adding variety to mechanics that actually get boring after a while and don't find enough elements che increases its thickness. At a certain point, then, there is a sort of ~jump~ in difficulty which makes the internships more complicated and can catch us off guard. Technically, an excellent job has undoubtedly been done: the characters appear very well drawn during the text sequences and the general design denotes a mature and effective style. The actual game action uses spectacular solutions in terms of explosions and light effects, while the scenarios are differentiated only when we change areas. The sound compartment provides a high quality musical accompaniment, perfectly themed, enriched by nice effects. The tested version is 1.1.1 App Store links", "date": "2010-04-01", "grade": "8.6"}
