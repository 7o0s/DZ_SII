Although it had all the makings of being one of the most impressive iPhone games ever, a dirty control system, some graphical glitches and a poor variety of situations didn't allow it to stand out in that teeming anthill of software that is the App Store. So, in order for everything to go smoothly, the guys from the German FishLabs team decided to take a good two years to develop a sequel which, in addition to correcting and improving the original formula, expands and enriches it immeasurably with a series of novelties, both in game mechanics and in the amount of activities that will keep the player busy throughout his adventure. In short, those who love starfighter clashes but were disappointed by the repetitiveness of Star Battalion or the inconsistency of Star Wars: Trench Run, perhaps they finally have a valid reason to go back to traveling in hyperspace. An immense galaxy The incipit of Galaxy on Fire 2 seems to want to wink at the Alien film series, and more specifically at its third chapter. The mercenary Keith T. Maxwell, former protagonist of the previous Galaxy on Fire, falls unconscious during a mission, only to wake up many years later in the other corner of the galaxy. Predictably, a big mess has happened in his absence, and an alien race is bringing death and destruction to the universe. It is therefore up to you to find a way to return safely to your home planet, seeking help from the numerous space stations and surviving the constant ambushes of space pirates. And it will not be a trivial matter, since the development team is committed to creating an immense galaxy that can be explored from top to bottom: the result is a path that leads you to cross 20 star systems and more than 100 space stations, on a journey that, if we consider side missions and side activities, keeps us busy for almost 10 hours of play. It's amazing how you never get tired of traveling from one system to another, thanks mainly to a couple of good ideas from the developers. For example, pointing to an asteroid or a station for a few seconds allows you to activate the autopilot, while doing the same with a distant planet you can jump into hyperspace and arrive at your destination in just an instant. In addition, the latest version of Galaxy on Fire 2 has added a key to speed up travel on autopilot, in order to further lighten the sporadic downtime. Those who want to take a break can go at any time to one of the many space stations around the galaxy, where it is possible to buy mechanical components or sell the treasures collected on their travels. The arrival of increasingly tough enemies will soon make it necessary to upgrade your ship, strengthen its defenses or increase its speed, and fortunately the developers have made available a huge set of parts and weapons to buy, making the customization phase much more meaningful and fun than in the first Galaxy on Fire. In the space stations it is then possible to meet other mercenaries and travelers, ready to entrust you with alternative missions or small tasks to increase your bank account: ranging from escorting a freighter to collecting minerals from asteroids, from speed races to the destruction of enemy ships . The enormous work done by FishLabs is palpable, not only in the variety of missions proposed, but also in the moral nuances they acquire from time to time, and which could lead the player towards one faction rather than another. The controls have also been improved compared to the previous chapter, and you can easily choose between the precision of the virtual stick or the involvement offered by the use of the accelerometer. In space battles pinpoint accuracy is not required to hit an enemy fighter, but this does not mean that the clashes are simple or trivial: the enemies always try to get out of your range of fire, making sudden maneuvers to disorient you and get behind you . Unfortunately, there is no possibility of performing spins or other stunts capable of giving a pinch of epicness to the battles, but compared to what we have seen so far on the App Store, Galaxy on Fire 2 is certainly among the most rewarding experiences on the square . On a technical level, the game is truly remarkable, although there are some flaws: with its splendid nebulae, the numberif stars and its wonderful planets, the galaxy has never been so lively, and on Retina Display it is even more spectacular; however the almost amateur quality of the illustrations of the characters clashes with the rest, while the same goes for the fluctuating dubbing, which goes from spot on voices to others that are unlistenable. The tested version is 1.0.2 Price: 5.49 App Store LinkN.B. Version 1.0.2 of the application has a bug that causes the game to crash when started. To work around it is necessary to access the device settings and change the language to English.", "date": "2010-11-11", "grade": "8.8"}
