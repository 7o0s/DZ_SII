The development team born from the idea of Dan Paladin and Tom Fulp has quickly climbed all the ratings and the credit certainly goes to the absolute quality of their productions. Battleblock Theater for example, but also Alien Homind and above all Castle Crashers, are three very entertaining titles and, what is even more particular, they belong to very different genres. When The Behemoth then announced that he was working on a new game, curiosity grew so much that we didn't miss the opportunity to try Pit People when it was still in the Early Access phase. After more than a year of patches, changes and improvements, the title has finally made its debut on Steam in its full version and we've come back to it to be able to give a definitive judgment. Ready to ride this bizarre new story? Space bears and petous mushrooms Two things set The Behemoth titles apart: the art style and the madness of the storytelling. If we will talk about the first later, it is good to start immediately by making it clear that yes, even Pit People is the standard-bearer of hilarity and surreal scenes, things that a sane mind would hardly be able to give birth to. A giant space bear, in a parallel universe, crash lands on the planet where blueberry farmer Horatio lives with his son. The impact completely changes the game world, giving life to a rain of deadly green blood and activating what for many has every impression of being the apocalypse. In all this commotion Horatio's son is kidnapped, the king of the realm dies, and a cyclops named Joseph joins the epic hoping to find his second eye. Madness, to be precise, but it's that kind of story that can't help but always keep you glued and eager to know what could happen even stranger. Trust us if we tell you that throughout the course of the adventure the situations you will experience will be borderline and no mission, not even the most trivial, will be told in a superficial way. There is always a comic aspect, an absurd solution for a simple task, in short, more than valid reasons to continue taking all those secondary quests that dot the production and will accompany us towards the end credits. So to say how long-lived Pit Peolpe is is extremely difficult. You could finish it in a handful of hours if you rush to complete the main storyline of Horatio without exploring anything in the game world, but you can also spend dozens of hours on the title exploring, building your perfect team, completing quests and collecting and collecting all the objects in possession of your opponents. Pit People shows two interesting faces: on the one hand we will have a game world covered by the fog of war to be explored, made up of imaginative and surreal scenarios, made up of rivers of orange soda and hills made of microchips where pizza squires and magic mushrooms coexist regularly . It's a colorful and completely hand-drawn scenery, full of things to discover and hidden areas to visit, all while racing aboard your magical chariot. Movement on the map is completely free of constraints and not limited by turns or time, you can go around at will stopping to face enemies or stunning them with rockets to continue without being disturbed: in a nutshell, absolute freedom. One more game If up to now the title may not have completely convinced you, wait to find out what The Behemoth has reserved for you for the heart of the game, that turn-based combat that refers so much to small pearls of the genre, unfortunately without ever reaching those peaks of depth . Pit People, in addition to the cartoon and demented frame, is in fact a well thought out strategic where your party of six characters will have to face enemies on hexagonal game grids in mortal combat. Each unit therefore has its own movement values and statistics which, based on the equipment chosen, vary the attack power, damage at a distance or resistance to blows. It's all very simple to understand and elementary to play, with the only sudden variable introduced by a sort of free will of our characters who, in the event of multiple targets available, will independently choose which one to attack. The impression that the title thus conveys is that of having live heroes in your hands and not just small puppets to manage on the screen, an excellent but impractical sensation if we analyze the pure strategic side. Then the classic rules of encirclement, damage to the shoulders or sides and other details that have now become canonical for titles of this genre are missing, leaving that aftertaste of good in the mouth but with something that fails to completely convince.To give greater depth to the tactical choices, the composition of the party must think about it, this one really full of hidden strategies. Every enemy you're going to face on the battlefield can in fact be captured, becoming an integral part of your army. You will thus be able to enlist poisonous mushrooms, explosive fairies, dark monsters and so on and so forth, each with specific characteristics and unique attacks, to then be modified in turn through an infinite plethora of equipment. The trick, in order not to get bored, is therefore to try to modify your group as much as possible, to adapt to the battles and to try to vary your strategies frequently. On balance, however, one inevitably ends up becoming attached to certain characters, essentially playing the entire adventure always with the usual party, unfortunately flattening and nullifying the great variety on offer. To put some spice then, the definitive solution is to activate the crazy mode, where the deaths will be permanent, requiring even more planning and above all forcing you necessarily to vary the structure of the team after each fight, collecting and capturing as many enemies as possible to never run out of characters. Mommy what a style! All this of course while your warriors take on the strangest forms, with absurd headdresses in pure The Behemoth style. The quality is what we have become accustomed to and the traits, as well as the cut scenes and animations, are always of the highest level, all crowned by a localization in Italian that can only make you happy and a truly sublime narrative voice. The game, available on PC and Xbox One, is extremely light and even on our configuration it showed no signs of letting up. It is perfect to be played in hit and run sessions but long afternoons in the company of Horatio are not to be disdained either, capable as they are of always arousing with that desire to play a new game before stopping completely. Multiplayer then takes care of expanding the already good longevity, which is certainly worth a few extra points for the production. In fact, you can face the adventure in two players locally, challenge each other in PvP arenas to try new tactics and strategies or throw yourself into challenges against artificial intelligence in the company of another player, all elements of absolute value given the current videogame overview , intent as it is on pushing the experiences for solo players ever further.", "date": "2018-03-06", "grade": "8.0"}
