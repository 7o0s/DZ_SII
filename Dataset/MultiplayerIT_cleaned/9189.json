For those unfamiliar with it, the story written by Hans Christian Andersen is about a one-legged toy soldier who falls in love with a paper ballerina. It does this during the night, when everyone is asleep in the house, and the toys come to life. A spring puppet with the features of a devil, jealous of the two, curses this new love, so much so that the following day he throws the toy soldier out the window and makes it fall into the rivulets of water that have formed in the street after an intense rain and who drag him to the sea where he is eaten by a fish. Fate wants that fish to be sold to the mother of the child who has lost her toy, who thus returns to the beautiful and sweet ballerina. The angry devil decides to spite the poor soldier again and causes him to end up in the fireplace. Except that, as he is sadly melting, a gust of wind makes the paper ballerina float beside him, merging together forever in a heart of lead. Although it has a bitter ending, the lead soldier has become a famous story for the little ones that inspired Rogue Sun, a team born from the developers of Lionhead (the creators of Fable), to create a video game where the tin men are the protagonists. In this Tin Hearts review we will tell you about a puzzle that takes us back to childhood among wooden toys and the story of a father's love for his daughter. Tin heart Tin soldiers come to life in Tin Hearts In Tin Hearts there isn't a ballerina to fall in love with, the story is based on the love of a master toy maker father for his daughter, while the levels of each puzzle are a piece that makes up the avenue of memories of this man, between carefree and happy moments alternating with tragedies and loneliness. The game revolves entirely around puzzle solving: the toy soldiers have to go through the creation studio to reach a small door, the goal to go to the next level, and to do so you have to use the toys that surround us. Being a puzzle game, the path to reach the end of the level is full of obstacles, and our task will be to correctly direct the march of the toy soldiers with the help of wooden molds to position and fit correctly, or move the trains in the right position. The levels that make up all of Act 1 are used to help us understand the rather simple and intuitive game mechanics, in order to continue and learn about the story that the Rogue Sun studio has decided to tell us. Continuing there will be new mechanics, going from the simple positioning of wooden shapes to the use of balloons to make the toy soldiers fly or the drums where the cute tin men can bounce to reach the highest and most distant surfaces. The elements to interact with are only those necessary to pass the level, an element that makes what we are called to do extremely intuitive. Everything in its place Although Tin Hearts is a puzzle game in all respects, the main story is its strong point In Tin Hearts we play as Albert, the father of little Rose, a famous inventor and skilled craftsman, capable of creating amazing and innovative toys. Each level leads us to discover something more about the story of this family, which initially presents itself as a happy family fairy tale, but which unfortunately will have to face rather difficult moments. Although it is a product in which most of the time we will find ourselves positioning objects correctly, the narrative plays a key role, adding depth to what is essentially a series of puzzles. Since these are memories, Albert's form is ethereal, making us understand right away that what we are experiencing belongs to the past and, thanks to the help of his inventions, we can discover what happened in his life. The point of view is always in the first person and this choice is justified not only by trying to make the experience more immersive, but also because Tin Heart, in the summer months of this year, will also arrive on Meta Quest and PlayStation VR 2. Despite this, the experience is extremely enjoyable on Nintendo Switch, where it is already available, but also on PC, the version on which we tested the game. The gameplay, in fact, is pleasant with both the mouse and keyboard and the controller. The first-person perspective and the essentiality of the required movements should go perfectly with virtual reality. At marching pace Although very creative, the ways to complete each level, in the long run, are rather repetitive The game takes approximately 6 hours to complete, a countio that can vary depending on your skill in intuiting more or less quickly the arrangement of objects in each level. As mentioned above, the story is the main reason that prompted us to continue from level to level, given that these, although original in their resolution, in some cases are quite repetitive, due to the reuse of some interactions and the setting background. The scenario is almost always the same and even the furnishings and elements on stage tend to repeat themselves with each puzzle, simply changing the correct arrangement to get the toy soldiers to the goal. To speed up the resolution of each level, a clock is used as a tool capable of increasing the speed of the incessant march of the tin toys, or to break boredom, observe them more closely by following them with a dedicated shot. At the same time it is possible to rewind time to fix a badly positioned wooden mold or recover the poor toy soldiers that ended up over the edge, shattered on the ground. The biggest help provided is the ability to pause time which, in addition to giving you time to think about what to do, shows the trajectory that the toy soldiers will follow once they leave the box that contains them. Thanks to this tool, the resolution becomes more immediate and manages to never make frustrating even those environmental puzzles that may seem more difficult to overcome at first glance.", "date": "2023-05-16", "grade": "7.5"}
