Following a path that goes through a splendid forest we are catapulted into a luxuriant natural environment that does not let us foresee the horrors that we will soon have to face. Having arrived at his destination, after lighting the fireplace, the man decides to go and get some water from a nearby well; on the way back, however, he discovers that a large sphere has appeared on the lawn adjacent to the hut. Intrigued by the mysterious object, he examines it but ends up on the ground passed out. When he wakes up he finds himself locked in a cage, in a place he doesn't recognize. Who brought it there? Why is there only death around him? What lurks in the woods? The sphere that ends the prologue and begins the adventure These and other questions form the background to the Lovecraftian story of The Land of Pain, which unfolds throughout the adventure. The game itself is instead a first-person horror that can be positioned halfway between Amnesia and Slender: The Eight Pages, with large moments of pure exploration linked to others in which you have to solve some puzzles, never too complicated (the only real difficulty sometimes it's finding the objects we need). The protagonist can walk, run for a few seconds and interact with objects by automatically picking them up or using them on others when carrying them. Obviously there is no shortage of a monster chasing us to kill us. But let's go in order and try to explain each point better. Caged As soon as we wake up in the cage we have to solve a first, simple puzzle to get out of it. In reality, already in the prologue of the hut we had a taste of how the puzzles of the game work and of the very simple interface that regulates them: they usually require the search for objects to be used in specific points to unlock passages. For example, you have to look for keys, or a ladder, or even crates to stack and so on. For the entire game there is only one mechanical puzzle that requires manipulating some valves. In general, the puzzles must all be tackled in a precise order and are built in a linear way, so that, when you have the overall picture of the area in which you are, you can proceed quite quickly in solving them. The trouble is that The Land of Pain is made up of often very large areas that force us to go back and forth several times to figure out what to do, often forcing us to walk for several minutes. This problem manifests itself above all in the initial part of the adventure, and then decreases in the final one, in which the areas become more dense. Just to give you an example, right at the beginning there is a blocked passage inside a house that requires a specific object to continue, an object that can be recovered at a certain distance, near another blocked passage. The atmosphere of the natural environments is well constructed Thus, after taking it, you go back to the first house, where you finally get an object to unlock the second passage, which requires another long walk to be reached. Another example is the mines, where you have to go back and forth several times along the tunnels that make them up to find what you need. After solving the first puzzles, the classic monster hunter appears who wants to kill us for reasons that will be explained by the various traceable documents and the protagonist's diary, in which the progress made is noted from time to time. At the first appearance we tried to evade the creature by playing up to it without succeeding. On the second attempt we tried to hide, but we were inexorably taken out. So we realized that it works more or less like in Slender and that the only way to save yourself when it chases us is to run at breakneck speed. Unfortunately this discovery, also linked to that of its territoriality (it appears only in specific areas), has somewhat reduced its impact, making us develop an action strategy that has proved to be effective for the entire game: run as soon as signs of his arrival are perceived on the screen (increase in intensity of the music and a slight blurring of the image). Areas of interest are highlighted by torchlight or candlelight Only in two advanced stages did the creature give us a few more headaches: these are areas in which the protagonist's breath is not enough to escape him and it is therefore necessary to make him take regenerative breaks, always keeping an eye on his approach. For the rest there is little to say about The Land of Pain, which from a technical point of view uses the CryEngine to create rich and convincing natural environments, while it sins a bit in the buildings, quite pbad on the outside and a bit poor on the inside. Even in this case, however, the best comes at the end, with better furnished homes and a few more details to enrich the scenario.", "date": "2017-10-16", "grade": "6.0"}
