A few weeks for the Temple Run 2 phenomenon to ~deflate~ a little (but the episode based on ~Oz the Great and Powerful~ is looming) and off we go, here is Hardlight (team already author of Sonic Jump) completes the development of Sonic Dash for an immediate release on the App Store (the Android version will follow shortly), offering it at an ~average~ price (1.79 euros, which will probably drop at the first good opportunity to boost sales) instead of adopting the rampant freemium format. All, however, without renouncing the in-app purchases, which in the specific case are used to purchase the red stars useful for unlocking the extra characters Knuckles, Tails and Amy, as well as for obtaining the various power-ups available in the integrated store: higher incidence of some items, start assist, boost that loads faster, and so on. Speaking of boost, the system adopted for Sonic Dash is practically the same seen in the latest work by Imangi Studios, with a bar that must be loaded and which, once full, allows us to shoot for a few seconds without worrying about chasms, obstacles , enemies and so on. But let's go back to the virtual currency for a moment, because if the red stars make up the valuable variant, there are also the traditional rings that the blue hedgehog can collect along the way, and which accumulate at the end of the game to allow us to make some purchases. Of course, unless you lose them by making contact with a trap or an opponent, in which case you would find yourself in the absurd situation of preferring a shorter distance traveled and a ~clean~ game over rather than losing everything you have. picked up in that stint. Dancing hedgehog The first thing that catches the eye of Sonic Dash is undoubtedly the graphics, colorful and full of elements, able to follow the style of the classic episodes both as regards the design of the enemies and the path, which as per tradition starts from the green glades of Greenhill. Sonic does not have to face curves like those of Temple Run and therefore the gaming experience appears much closer to that of the excellent Subway Surfers, also due to the exclusive use of the touch screen for the controls, which therefore do not involve the accelerometer for lane change (which must be done with a horizontal slide). The classic ~slide~ of the character in this case also becomes an offensive maneuver, with the blue hedgehog curling and rotating, eliminating any opponents in his way, while the jump left us a bit dumbfounded due to its lack of predictability. especially when the pace begins to increase and the obstacles come and go quickly, making it almost impossible to calculate distances well. The third-person shot allows itself a couple of variations on the theme when you go through the inevitable loops and when you come across a trampoline. At that point Sonic is projected into the air and can perform ~stunts~ based on the gestures indicated on the screen, then land on the next portion of the track to continue his run. The idea is not bad and shuffles the cards on the table for a moment, but on the terminal of our test (iPhone 4S) we have found quite evident drops in frame rate on several occasions, which indicate the presence of large margins for improvement in terms of optimization, which we hope will be filled by update. This inconvenience, in some ways marginal, is unfortunately coupled with the lack of strong concepts, capable of giving Sonic Dash its own recognition in the crowded panorama of endless runs.", "date": "2013-03-11", "grade": "6.8"}
