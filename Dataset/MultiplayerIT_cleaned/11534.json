The feeling of inadequacy and insecurity about one's abilities is a prerogative that accompanies this particular age since the advent of mass schooling (if not before), which has trained these individuals in order to place them in an increasingly vast world of work and varied, eradicating, over time, the idea of community in favor of extreme individualism. Which in turn has obviously become a source of considerable concern for those who should enter this forest that looks at the individual rather than at the group. The short narration of No Longer Home unfolds precisely from these problems. Developed by Humble Grove, a gaming collective formed by Cel Davison and Hana Lee, the title is inspired by the true events that saw the two developers protagonists in their last weeks as university students, before being thrown into the engulfing socio-cultural world English (but not only). Let's see together if the game managed to hit the mark in this review of No Longer Home. Find your own way No Longer Home: generational insecurity at the basis of the story created by Humble Grove The story of No Longer Home is divided into two distinct sections: a prologue and a macro-sequence lasting a couple of hours which contains all the narrative material of the title. The stories told are those of Bo and Ao, two university students who are about to leave their apartment in South London, since they have finished their studies. The relationship between the two is a mix of intimacy and friendship that does not follow binary canons and behaviors that many would define as ~normative~. After spending the last year together, the two find themselves forced to separate, as Ao cannot reside in England beyond the period of study due to his Japanese citizenship and the visa about to expire. narration and its staging is that this apartment is as if it were lost in a universe far from any problem, a metaphor both for the substantial period of ~hospitalization~ of the couple, stuck in a space practically deprived of any time coordinate, and for the distance of the two from the life that awaits them, unexplored and full of unknowns. A short story No Longer Home: sooner or later the time comes to say goodbye to friends and follow different paths No Longer Home is certainly not distinguished by the complexity of facts and events. The game is easily completed within a couple of hours, while fully exploring the game scenarios. The level of interaction is what we usually find in the most varied point and click, with the added possibility of rotating the map following the four walls of Bo and Ao's apartment, which makes it possible to discover new points of interest that contribute to slightly delve into the dynamics between the various characters. Despite this, the story seems only superficially sketched, ~inhabited~ by characters to whom it is hard to become attached due to the little time spent in their company. The feeling of fleeting encounter is something very difficult to balance. In this case, we have been in too little contact with the stories and concerns of these characters for them to become ours too. The end result is to find yourself in the end credits too soon. Perhaps, it was precisely this sense of incompleteness and sudden detachment that the two developers were interested in exploring, but the overall execution does not enhance this characteristic, rather the lack of a narrative compactness that justifies its implementation in videogame form. Derivative style or free inspiration? No Longer Home: the continuous metatextual reference to the videogame world (and not only) runs the risk of being cloying Right from the main menu, the influence that titles like Kentucky Route Zero have had on the Humble Grove duo's conceptualization of No Longer Home is evident. On the one hand, it is more than right to be inspired and guided by works that have profoundly marked our experience, but we must be careful not to overdo it. Here we find many elements in common with the Cardboard Computer title, from the management of textual elements to the updating of some sequences, with trolleys of the game room that lead to literally opening the scenario and revealing elements that are hidden or not very evident at first. as well as a dreamlike and ambiguous atmosphere that marks some key moments (never fully explored, in this case). The final result has the air of being extremely derivative and already seen, even if it still tries to find its own stylistic line through a rich chromatic palette and a particularly fascinating stylization (despite also has been influenced by other works, both videogames and otherwise). No Longer Home: the story of Bo and Ao is interesting, but often not valued properly However, we appreciated the desire to cite in the acknowledgments all those works and authors who inspired and helped to conceive the title and who are easily identifiable in the very structure of No Longer Home, from Japanese literary writings to films by Wong Kar-Wai and of the late Tarkovsky.", "date": "2021-08-29", "grade": "6.0"}
