With every microscopic step forward, the whole industry screams at the miracle, with people getting heavily wet in front of yet another, as majestic as adolescent filmed in computer graphics passed off as a video game or yet another scripted sequence forcibly inserted in the middle of the gameplay, which it's almost astonishing to see how Thirty Flights of Loving by Blendo Games has been received, simply one of the best narrative titles made so far. It's not a question of means, since it will be quite clear to you just by looking at the images that we are dealing with a very small production, with no pretension to amaze with giant textures, special effects, slaughters or falling helicopters; but it is a question of language, or rather of the ability to exploit the peculiarities of the videogame medium to tell a story, albeit a very short one. Thirty Flights of Loving has no cutscenes, no supporting text explaining what is happening on screen. You can interact with different objects scattered along the narrative arc, getting small details not bad, but you can't die. The plot begins and ends in a matter of minutes. We took about fourteen to the first full game. It is likely that many will find it difficult to call it a video game, but it is honestly difficult to try to associate it with any other medium. Yet how can we fail to be fascinated by such a skilful use of flashbacks and the editing of played sequences to create a spiral narrative that leads up to the grand finale? How to remain insensitive to one of the best stories expressed in videogame form? The Alternatives If you are interested in titles like Thirty Flights of Loving, let's call them art games, then you can't miss the equally experimental Dear Esther (link), in which you walk around an island reading the letters and texts written by the protagonist, trying to decipher history. Going a little further back, we can't fail to point out The Path by Tale of Tales (link), which uses the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood to tell a story about the growth and end of innocence. Finally, give a chance to The Void (link) by Ice-Pick Lodge, a title as complex as it is fascinating and introspective which is now found at bargain prices almost everywhere, online and offline stores. Not what you tell, how you tell it The Greek tragedians were well aware that it's not so much what you tell that makes a story, but how you tell it. Thirty Flights of Loving doesn't have a particularly original or elaborate storyline. We can summarize it in a few sentences: a theft gone wrong with a subsequent and dramatic escape attempt by the three who organized it. Then the game starts and you find yourself moving the protagonist from a first person view, with the classic WASD controls, then you advance quickly in a montage of sequences that reveal the facts with a delicate touch, leaving the player the pleasure of putting together the pieces of the different parts to recompose the overall narrative fabric. We start from the past, then naturally we experience the present, then we go back to the past. Slowly the plot clears up, but never completely. As users we are only witnesses of the story, which is enriched by the numerous details revealed by examining the different scenarios. There are firearms, but no shots are fired, at least directly. In the few minutes that it lasts, there is really everything: death, love, sex, friendship and despair. A complete fresco. There is also a pinch of irony, given above all by the choice to create cubic but particularly expressive characters (a choice already made by Blendo Games in the previous title of the same series of which Thirty Flights of Loving is part, or Gravity Bones), an intelligent and useful choice to mask the explicit productive limits (isn't this narrative wisdom too?). Many may complain that it is very short. It is true, but if you are looking for a long-lasting product that keeps you busy for hours and hours, perhaps collecting all the same objects by killing all the same monsters, just to increase the DPS, then stay away from Thirty Flights of Loving. If we want to give it a definition, let's understand it as an experimental videogame short story, something that you can only love if you are curious to understand how far videogames can go in storytelling. If you don't focus on this aspect, you risk generating the usual chatter about nothing. Let's leave those exclusive for triple A, come on.", "date": "2012-09-04", "grade": "8.9"}
