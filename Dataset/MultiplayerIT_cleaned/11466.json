{"name": "Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/naruto-uzumaki-chronicles-2-recensione.html", "text": "We're all a bit used to seeing the most famous Japanese manga and cartoons transformed into video games, but it's a trend that has only given rise to the birth of games of a certain quality in recent years. Furthermore, for some time now, the most popular series have given life not to a single transposition, but to various different products. If we take Dragon Ball Z into consideration, for example, we can see that Akira Toriyama's manga has not only inspired fighting games, but also RPGs, card games and action games. Being Naruto a series with a well-established success, it is clear that he deserves a similar treatment; and so here is that next to a classic fighting game like Clash of Ninja we have a different interpretation of the same genre, represented by Ultimate Ninja, as well as an action game under the title, precisely, of Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles. Developed by the Cavia team for Namco Bandai, the game allows us to control Naruto but also a large number of other characters, in a structure that mixes exploration and combat. The Chronicles of Naruto Uzumaki On the occasion of the release of this sequel, the developers decided to keep the same setting as the first episode, but to make a big change in terms of graphics: the characters are now made in cel shading, following in the footsteps of the other titles based on from the same anime. An introductory episode shows us the incipit of the story: Naruto finds Kankuro (Gaara's older brother, a skilled puppeteer) trying to escape a group of warrior puppets. The enemies are defeated and Kankuro is taken by Tsunade, the current Hokage, to witness the attacks suffered by the Sand Village. The architect of the violence has not yet manifested himself, sending his powerful puppets and a small army of bandits hired for the occasion. So Naruto, together with some companions, will have to leave immediately for the Sand Village and free it from the siege, in order to then understand who is behind these actions. The main mode of the game sees us control Naruto and other characters, moving on a map that gets richer as missions are completed. At the same time, new modes appear on the start screen: it is possible to access single missions or face only the bosses, even in multiplayer mode. The management of the characters is typical of role-playing games, in the sense that each one has different characteristics that must be enhanced both by fighting (with the level up, therefore) and by spending the objects and money earned during the clashes. You can work on the effectiveness of attacks (close or ranged), the power of magical techniques and the level of health and chakra. Furthermore, by spending a little money, you can access a sort of ~inventory~ with a different shape for each character, which must be ~filled~ with various types of power-ups, to be positioned so as to fill the spaces a bit as if we were faced with a sort of Tetris. The strength of the group As mentioned, the characters can be upgraded and can equip various kinds of bonuses, using the objects and money earned during the fights. It is clear that this applies to the character who actually takes part in the clashes, while those who remain ~at rest~ will remain empty-handed. In Naruto Uzumai Chronicles 2, this has a particular meaning, given that (again as in RPGs) we will run by controlling a single ninja, with the possibility of immediately replacing him with one of his companions by pressing a back button. It is a solution that has pros and cons: cornered, with low energy, we can at any time be replaced by a fresh and perky warrior, able to finish the battle for us; at the same time, the idea of powering up all the characters in the same way will prove to be bizarre from the beginning: the amount of objects and money that can be collected is limited, therefore it is better to concentrate on leveling a single ninja, moving on to the next one only when the first has nothing more to fear. Naruto and his companions have always different offensive combos, as well as unique special moves, all those seen in the cartoon. In reality, controlling one or the other character makes little difference, given that the controls do not change one iota, and unfortunately mediocre visual management is suffered in the same way, capable of making the conduct of the fights very cumbersome. Our ninja always runs, moving quickly, and often the offensive maneuvers are a matter of ~hit and run~, until all opponentsi don't stay dry. Rapid movement puts the virtual camera in crisis, which must be centered manually because it is unable to manage the situation independently. Given the level of the opponents, including the bosses, who can be defeated simply by attacking them at the right moment (perhaps when they get up from the previous assault), in the game it seems that the camera is our most fearsome enemy... Technical realization The transition from ~standard~ polygonal graphics to cel shading was not painless, given that the difference between characters and settings is now felt, and a lot. It must be said, however, that Naruto and his companions are made really well, with models with an excellent level of detail. These are probably the versions most faithful to the original ones seen in a tie-in of the series, and it is a pity that the same cannot be said for the animations, which do not shine for quality where at least they can have their say for quantity: each ninja has many unique attacks, even quite spectacular. The situation of the scenarios fluctuates, but often we are faced with very small stages, characterized by simple polygonal constructions, with good textures but little else. Let's say that the most beautiful things are seen in the ~forest~ locations, with bodies of water and so on, while the cities and maritime cross-sections are really bad, moreover with an always low level of interaction. The sound starts by default with the awful English voices, which thankfully can be switched off in favor of the original Japanese ones. The rest is a bit of a side dish: effects and music are average and accompany the action with the minimum wage, without high notes. Comment Of the video games based on Masashi Kishimoto's manga, Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles is certainly the most ~particular~: a mix between action game and role-playing game in which ~random~ fights are only a vehicle for character enhancement, in view of comparisons more significant. Wanting to take this interpretation for granted, therefore with the various fights with puppets and bandits acting only as ~training~ in view of the boss fight, one wonders why even the most important fights, in the end, are resolved in the usual sequence of offensive maneuvers, which often enough to produce with the right timing for things to be resolved in the best way. As long as the view allows it, of course. This sequel takes up the structure of the first episode, without enriching it or solving its problems. Technically well done, with some of the best cel-shaded characters seen in a Naruto game (contrasted with often mediocre backdrops), Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles 2 stands as an interesting product for fans of the leaf ninja, who will be able to try their hand at a unpublished storyline and control all the most important characters of the series. If you are not a fan of Naruto or expect a lot from this tie-in, however, it will be better to wait for the next episode. Pros: Beautifully crafted cel-shaded characters Numerous RPG elements that add depth to the game Fresh and interesting storyline... Cons: ...told through boring and endless sequences Terrible camera management Simplistic combat system", "date": "2008-04-22", "grade": null}
