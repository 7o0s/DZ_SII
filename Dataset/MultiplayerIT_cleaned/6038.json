{"name": "Hyper Void", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/156088-hyper-void-spazio-nostalgico.html", "text": "Hyper Void is the surprising creation of two talented brothers, Homan & Wessam Bahnassi, with several years of experience in the studios of Electronic Arts Montreal, released under the indie label INIFramez Technolgy. The title struck us instantly for its resemblance to two timeless classics: Gyruss and Tempest by Jeff Minter. From the second above all for the psychedelic style and the obligation to move the spacecraft on a pre-established grid, while from the timeless Konami masterpiece it draws the idea of movement based on an imaginary circumference. You will have understood that we are talking about a shooter, or more technically a ~tube shooter~, an incredibly little inflated genre, given that there are not many exponents except those mentioned. Hyper Void puts us in the role of a pilot driving the RM-24 spacecraft, traveling through space in search of clues about a mysterious virus, of probable alien origin, capable of taking control of any electronic circuit. In short, between one shooting and another there is also the claim to tell a story, an absolutely irrelevant detail in the economy of the title, but appreciable. The RM-24 has the ability to move through space-time tunnels that justify the famous ~grids~ of Minteriana memory. The problem is that these grids are infested with enemies of all kinds and we have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts to emerge unscathed from their assaults, all along about thirty levels which also include spectacular bosses. Hyper Void is a moving homage to great classics like Gyruss and Tempest Amazing journey Hyper Void is characterized by a decidedly varied and never predictable level design, despite the structural monotony, thus being able to keep the player's attention on. The shuttle has three types of attack distributed on special buttons on the controller: standard shots (which we will use more often), a slightly more powerful but slow double shot and a devastating laser capable of unloading a destructive trail. All shots have automatic fire, so just hold down the button to shoot, but be careful as they overload a bar on the right side of the screen, progressively slowing down the burst. This means that it is advisable to shoot only when enemies are in sight on the horizon and never for free. The enemies themselves show themselves through various forms but they all have in common that they are satellites, probes or anti-shuttle mines. Some are apparently invincible and can be destroyed only in certain circumstances, others explode with a volley of homing missiles to be carefully avoided, still others leave a persistent trail along the entire ~radius~ of the circumference, thus blocking the path and making the journey traumatic. maneuver. However, the RM-24 has one more asset: it can perform a quick side evasion, during which it is invulnerable. This move is achieved by pressing the back triggers, but this is also limited and should be used sparingly. The usefulness of the maneuver becomes crucial in the fights against the bosses, who have some attacks without free zones and therefore impossible to avoid normally. The shuttle has rechargeable energy shields, which can absorb a maximum of three hits, however direct contact with a boss can result in instant death. And speaking of the bosses, it is impossible not to mention one of the many ~mid~ that we can find in the middle of the level, a very fast probe equipped with a lethal circular blade that clearly recalls Saturn and is yet another reference to Gyruss. Needless to mention the animation of the shuttle moving towards the center of the screen at the end of a level. I bend you but I don't break you The INIFramez Technology title also impresses with the variety of levels; the RM-24 not only crosses the tunnels, which are always different, but also alternates sessions in space where the shuttle is anchored on the horizontal axis. To mention a specific part, where we have to survive a crazed asteroid discharge, but the programmers are never dry in terms of imagination. The infamous virus of history is revealed in the more advanced levels, hitting our spaceship and causing some side effects: it can happen to have the weapons completely blocked, moving at excessive speed and other similar situations that force us to adapt. For this reason, in the end, although well balanced, the playability of Hyper Void is based more on instinct, improvisation and the ability to move, while the bosses, some truly spectacular, obviously require a more analytical approach to understand their patterns. attack and weaknesses.Also noteworthy is the presence in the levels of special colored spheres which, if destroyed, confer various additional bonuses: the classic smart bomb, total invulnerability and a combined attack of the three types of shot available, which bring a high offensive power. After the first warm-up loops, the game inserts increasingly complex elements and conditions, raising the bar of difficulty. After the tenth stage, Hyper Void becomes a very challenging title, but never frustrating thanks to the efficient checkpoint system and infinite lives. In essence, there is no real game over, but the section of the level where we got stuck is endlessly faced until we can pass it. There are no difficulty levels but, on the other hand, once you become familiar with the controls and get into the right spirit, everyone can get great satisfaction, especially after having knocked down an end-of-level boss. Playstation 4 trophies Hyper Void features 15 Trophies with rather original objectives. Some are unavoidable, such as ~Mr. Anderson!~, obtained after contracting the terrible virus protagonist of the story, others require much more extreme maneuvers, such as a 10-second ceasefire against the level 9 IPA_IRecon boss, far from a health walk! The 90s Technically, Hyper Void is a bare-bones but beautifully crafted product that takes advantage of PlayStation 4 to some effect of undeniable impact. The game runs at sixty frames per second without stuttering, presenting a psychedelic style with typical 90s colors and at the same time building an unstoppable nostalgia for the golden era of arcade cabinets. Despite the indie nature, the various visual touches of class and the beauty of some grids amaze, as well as the very particular general characterization, which often refers to the vector graphics of the Vectrex era. Less relevant in comparison the music, rather bland and repetitive; a production like this deserved a more inspired soundtrack, even if the techno-trance arrangements set up to accompany the action are still adequate. The only flaw that we can detect is the absence of a quantity of content that justifies a good longevity of the product. After the 29 levels, all that remains is to face them again in Hyper Mode, where we cannot count on energy shields. Some multiplayer options would have been desirable, at least through the online rankings which in these products always represent a nice stimulus. Finishing the missions doesn't take more than three hours, after which, although getting to the end is not a walk in the park, there isn't much to do. To compensate for this content defect contributes the very low price, less than 8 euros, which still makes it more than interesting for enthusiasts.", "date": "2015-09-15", "grade": "8.0"}
