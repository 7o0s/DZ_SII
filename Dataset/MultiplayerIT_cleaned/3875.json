{"name": "Book of Demons", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/book-of-demons-recensione.html", "text": "Diablo is the first game that should be mentioned in any Book of Demons review. After all, the Thing Trunk title starts right from the Blizzard game, trying not so much to renew it, but to exploit its basic formula to offer a completely different gameplay. The start of the title is really familiar: we are in a village, similar to Tristram, where some characters, similar to those who populated Tristram, tell us about a danger hidden under an ancient cathedral, similar to the one that once stood in Tristram . At the beginning of the adventure we are presented with an outline of the underground levels that we will have to overcome to reach the conclusion, complete with the main bosses. Needless to say, the final villain is a big red demon, while on the way you will have to face other well-known creatures, such as a giant butcher armed with a cleaver. Diablo's 'quotes' don't end there, given that the dungeon settings are identical to those of Blizzard's title, as are many enemies. The visual style is different, with the non-player characters, the hero and the enemies that are represented as if they were sheets of paper, but the general feeling is decidedly that of Diablo, from which you don't get away throughout the course of the game. adventure. The soundtrack also comes from there, with light touches of acoustic guitar to accompany the action and songs that unmistakably recall those of Matt Uelmen. Fortunately, the game mechanics are very different. Book of Demons is an action RPG, but with a very particular setting. Firstly, the main character is not free to move around the entire area of which a level is formed, but must follow well-defined corridors / tracks. When any object, including enemies, enters its range, it becomes interactive. For example a chest can be opened, a vase can be smashed or an opponent can be attacked. Fighting is very simple: click on an enemy and hold down the attack button until you've killed him. Depending on the skills available and the class chosen at the beginning of the game (warrior, thief and mage) you can carry out different types of attack, such as hitting with the weapon held, using area attacks, shooting arrows and so on. If the enemies are too many or too powerful (as in the case of the bosses) you can retreat as needed, in order to try to take as little damage as possible. The lower part of the screen houses the energy and mana bars, and the card slots, the real core of the gameplay. In fact, it is the latter that determine the capabilities of our hero. The more you advance in the adventure, the more you get and the more you can build a multifaceted and personal character. Cards give effects only when they are assigned: if they are red they have a limited amount of charges, if they are blue they are linked to the classic mana bar and if they are green they give passive skills, which are always active. With the continuation of the adventure, the basic cards become ineffective and must be replaced with new ones, or they must be upgraded. In this way a funnel is essentially created that channels the player's choices towards a very specific style of play: in fact, it is not possible to enhance all the cards that are found, even if they are the main character growth system. In reality, by killing monsters you also level up, but with fairly limited effects, given that you can only choose whether to increase life or mana and, moreover, it is possible to go to the village and pay to have the upgrade discarded. If in its general elements Book of Demons is quite successful, some more specific ones end up making it anything but memorable. In particular, we think of the repetitiveness of the action, with the fights that repeat themselves identically for the entire game, albeit varying in intensity. In the long run they end up tiring. Some new peculiar mechanics crop up here and there, but let's say that the bulk is all shown during the first few dungeons. Even excessive adherence to Diablo can be disturbing: it is true that the developers have never made a secret of what their main inspiration was, but at the same time knowing practically always what to expect impoverishes the whole experience, which ultimately long ends up having a strong taste of leftover from the night before. To say: the whole game is so eager to let us know that it has copied Diablo that it immediately reveals its most iconic elements, so as to leave no doubt (think of the aforementioned bosses). Not that Book of Demons doesn't have its moments, on the contrary, but its being a gigantic quotation inevitably limits its imagination. mThe flexiscope deserves special attention, a system that allows you to create batches of variable length (minimum 10 minutes) with all the elements condensed and dosed as needed. It was designed for those who occasionally want to play but don't have much time. The flexiscope also reveals how Book of Demons was actually conceived, that is, as a kind of pastime for Diablo fans. Those disappointed by the announcement of Diablo Immortal will probably like it a lot.", "date": "2019-01-02", "grade": "7.0"}
