The World: The Game Complete Ediition comes more than ten years after the release of the original version of the game, released in 2010 on PS3 and Xbox 360. It is indeed a remaster strongly desired by old and new to the comic created by Bryan Lee O'Malley and the funny film based on it, and who had been waiting for such an announcement for a long time. Ubisoft therefore did not hold back and answered the call, remastering the peculiar scrolling fighting game and placing it within a complete edition of all the DLC with the extra characters and the online cooperative multiplayer. As the brave Scott Pilgrim, are you ready to face Ramona Flowers' seven evil ex-boyfriends again? Graphics and music: style to sell The first thing that strikes you about Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game Complete Edition is undoubtedly the pixel art graphics, which have aged quite well precisely because of their craftsmanship. Visible pixels are obviously wanted, it's all a great tribute to the arcade classics of the early 90s but also to the aesthetics of the 80s: a very colorful and sensational mix, which is embellished between one stage and another by drawings by O'Malley himself. The great abundance of characters is surprising, and we are not referring only to the playable ones. There are Scott Pilgrim and his girlfriend Ramona Flowers, but also band members Stephen Stills and Kim Pine, as well as a couple of nice add-ons to unlock (in the case of Knives just connect to your Ubisoft Connect account to get it). However, the reference is to the abundance of enemies, divided into various types, each with different attack patterns; not to mention obviously the bosses, who are introduced in an increasingly spectacular and multifaceted way. Then there are the scenarios, also quite numerous, scattered within seven worlds that we will be able to navigate through a Super Mario Land-style world map and which are each divided into two zones, freely accessible after having reached them for the first time with a specific character. They range from the snowy streets of Toronto to the film sets of Lucas Lee, from the building that hosts the Clash at Demonhead concert to the train on which we will find ourselves chasing a mysterious ninja, from masquerade parties to parks. Our wandering within these locations is accompanied by a set of amazing chiptune-style music, which immediately enters the head and never leaves. Of course, a greater variety of tunes would have helped since at a certain point the themes composed by the Anamanaguchi inevitably become repetitive, but nevertheless there are some turns that we found just as exciting as ten years ago. Gameplay: strengths and weaknesses If the technical sector of Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game Complete Edition has kept up thanks to the hand-drawn sprites and the excellent animations made with traditional methods, the same cannot be said exactly of the gameplay, which after ten years from the original publication it feels even more the weight of certain shortcomings. Let's be clear: we are not saying that the game is not enjoyable, far from it. Both in single and above all in cooperative (on Nintendo Switch possible locally even by holding a Joy-Con each, as well as obviously online), the Ubisoft remaster takes up the classic mechanics of scrolling fighting games and does it competently, but placing a number of important limitations. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game for PS3 and Xbox 360 was a very difficult title, even at the lowest challenge level of the three available, and its hardcore approach hasn't changed a bit. This formula translates into very tough enemies and used to parrying our blows, with an all too short reach, as well as retreating to escape any offensive. As long as the clash is even, there are no major problems in defending yourself by managing punch, jump, parry and the inevitable special that consumes vital energy, as well as lateral rejects to exploit the three-dimensionality of the scenarios in order to avoid damage. However, when the opponents become many or use tricks to gain an advantage, such as the momentary stunning of our character, the situation becomes chaotic and frustrating. A rather stingy collision detection does not help, which sees us sensationally miss the target when we have an overlapping enemy, as well as the presence of the same edges of the original game, which Ubisoft has not thought of smoothing out on the occasion of this remaster. And so it becomes impossible to direct punches quickly from side to side, within an in movement systemwhich it is frequent to get stuck somewhere. The ruthlessness of the structural rules, on the other hand, must be seen from the perspective of an approach that does not want to diminish the experience by granting us infinite checkpoints and continuous. No, each stage is faced several times, at game over you start over but there is a clear progression to mark the skills of the roster, surprisingly well differentiated: you can carry out a playthrough for each protagonist, to the full advantage of longevity. Extra mode In addition to the original campaign, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game Complete Edition also includes four extra modes accessible from the home screen. It is respectively a boss rush, a zombie-based survival (much more resistant than normal enemies), a versus and a dodgeball-based minigame in which we will be able to knock our opponents down only by throwing the sphere at them. Nice additions, but which don't weigh too much on the overall quality of the experience.", "date": "2021-01-13", "grade": "7.5"}
