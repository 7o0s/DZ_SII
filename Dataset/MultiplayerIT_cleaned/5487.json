And considering that it was a modernized version of Kirby Superstar for SNES and Kirby's Adventure for Wii, it may seem counterintuitive. However, in recent years, incumbent developer HAL Laboratory has taken the trouble to explore new avenues with gaming's favorite pink wad, only to find that Kirby fans crave old-fashioned platforming far more than experiments with touch screens. We shouldn't be surprised, then, if Kirby's outing on Nintendo 3DS this year draws heavily on Triple Deluxe. And we're using an understatement: Planet Robobot is, to all intents and purposes, the spiritual sequel to the platformer released in 2014, so similar in structure and features that it almost seems like the same game. On the one hand we were very happy with this choice, on the other we could not help but turn up our noses at the lack of courage of the Japanese software house ... Kirby: Planet Robobot is a fun and well thought out platformer, but it tastes a little too much of what has already been seen Independence Kirby Once upon a time like any other day in Dream Land: Kirby is taking a sound nap, as usual, when a giant spaceship arrives from space. While King Dedede and the others try to defend themselves against the invasion with cannon fire, Meta Knight drives his flying vessel right into the mechanical monstrosity, only to end up sunk beyond the horizon. Upon awakening, Kirby finds himself in a world that is almost completely unrecognizable. The alien spacecraft has begun a terraforming process that is transforming the verdant Dream Land into a cybernetic planet, so all that remains is to attack the enemy directly, destroying the five mechanical legs that have sunk into the ground to change it at a molecular level. Five paws for five ~worlds~, in short, divided into about six levels each: five normal stages, to which are added a special stage and one dedicated to the end-of-the-world boss. The latter are unlocked by collecting the Code Cubes hidden in the previous stages, exactly as happened in Kirby: Triple Deluxe with the Stones of the sun. The structure of the game is substantially identical, as you may have understood, and the story is revealed through short cinematic sequences starting from the third world: it is certainly not an RPG script, but it still offers a small incentive on the narrative front, especially thanks to certain twists that bring back into the spotlight some characters that fans of the franchise will surely recognize. Unfortunately the game in and of itself is less surprising, and it follows the usual sequence of thematic stages that we have been used to for years: we start from the verdant regions, we move on to industrial complexes, cities, ice cream and sweets factories, deserts and underwater caves. Fortunately, on this front Planet Robobot immediately appears much more varied than Triple Deluxe, given that the stages tend to diversify from each other, offering different themed mechanics and puzzles from world to world. Anyone who has played Kirby's previous adventure on Nintendo 3DS will instantly recognize the most endearing ones; you still have to steal powers from the right enemies to light fuses, power batteries or melt ice, but new enemies soon enter the scene and give Kirby some truly bizarre powers. Among others, the pink wad can transform into a doctor and hurl pills at enemies, or absorb creepy sorcerers to blow poisonous clouds and spread acid on the floor. The laziest can also scan their amiibo to instantly unlock powers and regenerative foods, but the level design tends to place the right enemies in the right place, so that a quick glance is enough to put two and two together and understand how to solve the environmental puzzle of the moment . The 3D effect The HAL Laboratory guys once again prove to be true wizards of three dimensions: the stereoscopic effect is implemented excellently and the added depth plays a leading role in many stages, perhaps when facing certain bosses or puzzles. Too bad that every now and then it noticeably reduces the frame rate. Kirby unit 01, lift off! Compared to Kirby: Triple Deluxe, in fact, the Japanese developer has taken a few steps back in terms of general difficulty. Not that Kirby's previous adventure was a particularly difficult platformer, mind you, but he still managed to make us think a few more seconds about the various environmental puzzles, especially when crossroads, treadmills and timed sequences came into play. In Planet Robobot, however, the solution athe various puzzles is literally a phone call, and when the game doesn't place an electric enemy next to a socket, it draws huge boards directly in the background that suggest the order of the buttons to press or the steps to take. The bosses have also been slightly scaled down: they remain action-packed and layered battles, but defeating them is much easier, not to mention that some powers - such as those of the archer or psychic - have overly powerful abilities. Planet Robobot's big feature, however, are the mechs. From the very first internships, Kirby can pilot real mobile suits, mechanical exoskeletons that give him resistance and strength... superhuman, so to speak. Aboard a mech, our hero can simply punch previously indestructible obstacles, or interact with the environment to solve simple puzzles or finish off mechanical bosses, unscrewing them piece by piece. As if that weren't enough, even mechs can absorb the powers of enemies, scanning them and visually transforming themselves: by absorbing the power of the swordsman, the mech grows two huge blades that can cut chains, while the power of the stone installs two gigantic big hands with which to push crates and vehicles to use as new platforms. In short, the mechs are in Planet Robobot what the Hypernova power was in Triple Deluxe: a simple ~gimmick~ that allows you to progress in the stages. Unfortunately, however, they are a much less surprising feature, also because the game rarely allows you to choose whether to use them or not: in most cases we are forced to board a mech, asphalting every enemy or obstacle along the way as if they weren't even there. More rarely, however, it happens that you have to choose whether to continue aboard the mech or not, aware that one of the two possibilities will lead to a code cube or a secret sticker. The latter replace the Triple Deluxe keychains on the collectibles front: there are two hundred of them and, surprisingly, it is possible to apply them on the mechs to customize them. The idea is delightful, too bad it's also ridiculously limited since it is only possible to modify the arms of the mechs with one sticker each. Beyond these considerations, the level design still remains stratospheric, thanks also to the use of depth and levels of parallax in the structuring of the stages. Between scrolling shooter-style missions, mad racing and underwater tunnels in which to swim, there is certainly no lack of variety, and this makes the experience decidedly satisfying, thanks also to a technical sector substantially identical to what was seen in Triple Deluxe, but noticeably more elaborate and lively in terms of details and animations. Closing the circle are the inevitable extra modes: two special campaigns that are unlocked by finishing the game, and on which we won't add anything else so as not to spoil the surprise, as well as two mini-games that are anything but obvious. Challenge 3D Kirby is rather trivial, to tell the truth: it is a series of isometric stages in which we have to wipe out waves of enemies and bosses by spitting out as few stars as possible. Team Kirby in Action, on the other hand, is delightful. It is a kind of ~arena~ thanks to which it is possible to face some of the historical enemies of the pink wad that do not appear in the story mode for once, such as Dadopagos and Whispy Woods: we can control Kirby in fantasy-themed variants that recall the games of classic roles, such as the barbarian, healer, mage and knight, and level up with each victory to make life easier against the toughest bosses. In this mode it is also possible to play in four by connecting as many Nintendo 3DS: only one cartridge is needed, so it is an ideal mini-game if you share a passion for Kirby with some good friends. Kirby and amiibo As we have already said, Kirby: Planet Robobot is compatible with the amiibo distributed so far by Nintendo. Up to ten amiibo can be used per level at any one time, and each amiibo grants Kirby a certain power that depends on the figurine being scanned. Nintendo was kind enough to send us two samples of the brand new Kirby Collection amiibo line, namely Waddle-Dee and King Dedede. Kirby Collection amiibo not only give Kirby the powers of his enemies, but also a unique appearance. For example, scanning Waddle-Dee will give Kirby the power of the umbrella and make him orange, complete with a bandana on his head. The King Dedede amiibo, on the other hand, turns Kirby blue, wears a hat and gives him the power of the hammer.", "date": "2016-05-26", "grade": "8.0"}
