Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Tested version: iPhone Sometimes wishes come true! Owain Weinert, ten years old, suffering from leukemia, was able to realize the concept of a video game for the iOS platforms thanks to the collaboration between the Make-A-Wish Foundation and PopCap Games, which ~lent~ the internal team 4th & Battery to the directives by Owain. The developers found themselves being spurred and inspired by the child, who went several times to check that their work adhered to what he had in mind, which is a mix of tower defense action and strategy that pits the stellar police forces against three enemy factions, within as many scenarios: Earth (degree of difficulty: novice), Mars (degree of difficulty: veteran) and finally Flamiar (degree of difficulty: insane). The gameplay of Allied Star Police, which can be downloaded for free from the App Store in the iPhone or iPad version, is extremely simple and straightforward, so much so that you can jump into the action right away. The battlefield consists of four ~lanes~ (very similar to Plants Vs. Zombies, therefore) that separate the base of our troops and the enemy. Well, our goal is to overwhelm the opponent's forces, completely cross the space that separates us from his position and then destroy it. The undertaking will not be simple and indeed will become substantially more complicated depending on the scenario chosen at the start, with not indifferent peaks of difficulty on the inhospitable planet Flamiar. My vehicle is bigger than yours The control system of Allied Star Police is completely based on the touch screen and makes use of a very understandable interface. In fact, in the lower part of the screen we find a series of buttons (seven, when they are all available) that allow us to produce four categories of vehicles and three special weapons, clearly spending an increasingly higher amount of money. If we press the button relating to a vehicle, we can then place it on the battlefield by touching the ~lane~ on which we want it to move, and at that point the vehicle will proceed from left to right, automatically attacking all the enemies it encounters until it the armor of the hostile base. The first vehicle available, the ATV, is reasonably fast and has a consistent rate of fire, but has poor armor, which prevents it from reaching far; the second vehicle, the Sniper, is a much more resistant armored vehicle that fires a single cannon shot, albeit more effective; then there is the Tank, a balanced solution between speed, resistance and power, capable of resolving very complicated situations; and finally the huge WCSV, a generously sized tank, very slow both in moving and in firing, but resistant and deadly. As we eliminate the enemies and earn money, we can therefore continue to produce vehicles and place them in the four lanes, trying to outnumber the enemy troops and close them near their base. The action is frantic and fun, with a precise response to the commands and a perfect management of the camera, which automatically snaps to where something happens, but which we can move by dragging the screen. The additional weapons (a ~boost~ to be assigned to a vehicle, a series of bombs or a deadly satellite laser) complete the picture of a not infinite but very well differentiated arsenal, capable of giving rise to even rather long battles, especially at of higher difficulty. All this is accompanied by a pleasant soundtrack in hard rock style and excellent bitmap graphics, colorful and well designed.
