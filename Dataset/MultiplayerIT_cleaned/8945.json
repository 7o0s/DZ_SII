The first reason for the existence of the Microsoft console, and a mirage for Apple players for years, Halo: Combat Evolved has weaned the competitive FPS on the console and has given us one of the most epic campaigns in the gaming world. It is no coincidence that many players have felt the desire to replay it, in a modern version, as they relived the early stages of the war in Halo: Reach. On the other hand, the two titles are directly connected and the desire to redeem the first defeat by taking back the last remaining Spartan must have stuck in the brains of the guys from 343 Industries. And so, with the collaboration of Saber Interactive and Certain Affinity, the new makers of the saga have brought the progenitor of the series back to life by developing a new graphics engine to be applied directly on the old one. The multiplayer issue is different, the structure of which is that of Halo: Reach and which we deal with first. Two sided multiplayer Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary includes 7 multiplayer maps that are compatible with Reach multiplayer and can be loaded directly onto hard drives, or purchased separately on Live by those who don't intend to buy this anniversary edition, to be bundled directly into the multiplayer experience of the latest Halo. Curated by 343 Industries, which has already demonstrated its ability with maps, the 6 competitive arenas come from the first two chapters of the series and can be played in classic mode, i.e. in the old form and with the classic power ups, or with multiplayer of Reach which includes perks and new modes and also involves several changes to the structure of the maps. Some elements can also be modified with the forge which allows you to alter various map objects including teleports. Battle Canyon is the third appearance of Battle Creek with some slight differences from the famous map that already appeared in the first and second Halo. With two symmetrically arranged bases, and several secondary passages, this map, while small, allows for quick detours and looks quite fun in capture the flag. Damnation is instead the remake of Penance. Already shown several times by the team is a map arranged on three levels which in team slayer rewards those who manage to conquer the highest positions. Obviously in Reach mode the jetpacks allow the trailing team to continuously assault the upper positions. Ridgeline is set in nature and is taken from Timberland, a map for Halo PC which in this new form, in addition to being surrounded by the ruins by the creators of the ~rings~, sports more imposing trees and is shorter. This makes it easier to move quickly from one part of the map to another making it particularly suitable for lightning-fast capture the flags. It is no coincidence that the only vehicles available are Warthog and Ghost. High Noon is based on Hang'Em High and is a map set in a semi-closed structure. But the absence of vehicles and the extremely large spaces make it suitable even for 16 players. The commanding elevated position allows you to control the expansive lower level, but the replacement of the concrete with glass, compared to the one present in the first Halo, allows players below to keep an eye out for lurking enemies. Breakneck is an urban map, but with large spaces, which takes up Headlong, the famous 16-player arena of Halo 2. Dominating in this case are undoubtedly the means with the Gauss Warthog which can be lethal with its hit and run and its ability to spread the Banshee in no time. Of course dealing with the Scorpion is another matter and a seemingly open road can become a death trap in no time at all. Solitary is the remake of Prisoner and a classic multi-level arena where the raised area allows you to control large portions of the map and make the lives of inattentive players hell. Obviously, also in this case the possibility of climbing quickly with jetpacks significantly alters the gameplay even if the ascent of the levels has already been made easier, in Reach mode, compared to what it is in the original map playable in classic mode. The seventh map is the only novelty of Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and is of type Firefight. Installation 04 also introduces a novelty represented by AI-controlled allied soldiers and ODSTs. The degree of challenge seems lower, at least on normal difficulty, but the news is welcome as it refreshes the novelty. Generation leap Let's go back to the main experience which, in what is obviously a nostalgic operation, is undoubtedly the campaign. Relive the debut of Master Chief, preferably with a friend, is a real joy thanks to the new graphic design that completely revolutionizes the visual sector of the title. Obviously here and there evident traces of the past re-emerge, especially as regards the macrostructures and vegetation, which prevent the title from reaching the aesthetic rendering of the next gen chapters of the series. But the gorgeous lighting, state-of-the-art water, and completely redone models bring a whole new flavor to the defining moments of Halo: Combat Evolved - Anniversary. To check how big the jump is, simply press select to switch to classic graphics mode. But in doing so we also realize another thing, namely that the animations and backgrounds of the old Halo are still able to amaze, despite the fact that it is obviously a title released at the beginning of the last hardware generation. Obviously these considerations melt like snow in the sun once you apply the new textures, new models and new lighting that give shape and visibility to hills, valleys, covenant bases and so on. The arrival in flight of the Silent Cartographer mission is heart-pounding and a whole new world opens up before our eyes which makes us a little less unsettling, given the greater luminosity, but which gives a completely different look to the repetitive corridors in which the central part of the title takes place and which also makes exploration through the environments made less anonymous and decidedly more vital by the generational leap more pleasant. Added to this is the possibility, exclusive to the Kinect, to scan and collect information on the ~ring~. Made with a sci-fi cut, this feature is obviously marginal but helps to immerse us in the title. Dated gameplay or classic gameplay? Perhaps, from a gameplay point of view, it would have been better to make the modifiers related to the skulls available immediately in order to give players the possibility to immediately replay the campaign in an altered form. On the other hand, the formula is the old one and therefore lacks elements such as the dual wielding of weapons, the possibility of assaulting vehicles or the complex melee combat introduced later. Thankfully some elements, such as the sniper rifle, have been completely updated with the visor on full display even when the zoom is not activated. But the more limited physics engine (but still surprising when the explosions follow one another and the bodies are thrown everywhere) and the fact that some monsters, like the Hunters, don't necessarily have to be hit in vulnerable points, force us to force a The experience is limited both compared to that of the last chapters of the series, which introduced vehicle maneuvers and articulated melee, and compared to modern flagship FPSs. Yet even without novelties, without sprints and without perks, and with that damn series of corridors all the same that characterize a couple of missions, the gaming experience remains damn captivating with unique weapon feedback, the sensational battles in the open field and the AI of companions and enemies that is still superior to that sported by many modern titles. A good machine gunner on our Warthog can in fact be an extremely valuable resource for eliminating the crowds of enemies who continue to descend on the ring. In addition, the enemies quickly outflank us, perform unsettling dodges and put pressure on us even on normal difficulty. It is no coincidence that at maximum difficulty the cooperative is highly recommended to avoid frustrating situations and this time, fortunately, it is also possible to play with a friend online, in full screen. Not to be underestimated is the addition of the 10 terminals, one per mission, which contain unpublished sequences full of information about the history of the ~Halo~ and the arrival of the Covenant. The search for the skulls then highlights the vastness of some maps that must be explored far and wide (but it is also possible to wait for the classic video guide on Youtube) to find the bare skulls capable of activating the gameplay modifiers (unfortunately not supported by a point mode). A size to which we are undoubtedly accustomed today but which 10 years ago, with those graphics, was a rarity. In fact, the first Halo was not only able to refine the FPS experience on consoles, carefully calibrating the semi-assisted aim and controls, but it gave us extremely large environments, crossed by immense structures and without loading of any kind, and above all a vehicle experience never experienced before in the genre. It is therefore not surprising, but still striking, that by updating almost only the graphics, the title is still extraordinarily playable today. The feeling you get when shooting is aico and makes it immediately clear how this title has convinced and enthralled millions of players. It's not just a matter of glance, vehicle physics, the charm of the Spartan uniform and whatnot. It's pure gameplay, tactile response, feeling of control of the character. In essence, the gameplay of Halo has aged quite well and supports the new graphics engine worthily. Xbox 360 goals With multiplayer being shared with Reach and all eyes on the campaign it's only natural that all goals are tied to single player/co-op. Most of the objectives are of the progressive type and ask us to complete the game on various difficulties but there are also some more demanding challenges which sometimes include a high mortality rate. In any case, the full loot, or the thousand points, is quite simple to conquer, especially with the help of a cooperative partner. The donut hole Even if the generational leap is clear, the splendid lights that illuminate the windows of the Pillars of Autumn cannot distract too much from the fact that outside there are not the burning skies crossed by the Reach spaceships. In short, the transformation of Halo is incredible but the structure of the latter, however advanced for the time, weighs on the overall yield when compared with the titles of the current generation. Here and there, especially in cut-scenes and indoors, elements emerge that make one's nose turn up and cushion the general amazement. Furthermore, there are some technical problems such as the pop up of the shadows, some glitches in the textures and several shots during the cutscenes. In any case, it was perhaps impossible to ask the developers for more without forcing them to create a completely new title and the work done is truly massive with suggestive glimpses, an incredible leap into detail and dozens of lights that dynamically illuminate trees, rocks and patterns. In short, while failing to reach the heights of Reach, the Saber engine brings us much more than a simple restructuring and even if the gameplay, fortunately, is unchanged, most of the game environments have been so enriched as to be unrecognizable. On the contrary, the multiplayer is just that of Reach, graphics and modes included, so much so that we can consider this sector of Halo: Combat Evolved - Anniversary as a DLC included for free in the package. It is no coincidence that the maps are also sold separately, for users who only have Reach, for 1200 Microsoft Points. The remastered soundtrack (you can also listen to it in its original form) is an obviously welcome addition. In this way the atmospheres of the time are maintained, guaranteed by a damned suggestive soundtrack, gaining in quality. The dubbing in Italian is confirmed among the best in the mistreated videogame sector. There is obviously no shortage of jokes from the marines who insult each other or underline what is happening around us and, while also using improbable formulas such as ~bastard ally~, give depth to the situation. Finally, the exclamations of the Covenant also return to cheer our auricles and with their shrill voice they begin to create the myth of the Master Chief, the demon who can wipe out an entire invading force.", "date": "2011-11-14", "grade": "9.0"}
