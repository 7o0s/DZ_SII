One of his most successful projects is undoubtedly Slayin, a small and simple Flash arcade distributed for free on PC and inspired by the mechanics of Fairune, another freeware game that has only recently arrived on iOS. Unlike the Japanese Skipmore, however, Schreiber has opted for a side view and a shorter and more frenetic action. The result is a significantly different experience, perfect for a mobile version that is not long in coming. Non-stop RPG The mechanics that underlie Slayin are those so simple as to be almost banal, yet at the same time surprisingly original and attractive. It's one that doesn't need much explanation to throw the player into the middle of the action. On first launch you can choose only one of the three game modes and only one of the three playable characters, the knight. Sword drawn, the diminutive hero automatically moves left and right on the screen, eliminating every enemy he encounters along the way. All the player has to do is reverse the direction of the walk and possibly jump to overcome traps or hit flying creatures. Enemies who touch the knight's blade are instantly eliminated, while those who manage to get behind him, surprise him from above or emerge from the underground can damage and possibly kill him. Thus we make our way through hordes of slimy monsters, zombies and skulls, and there are even battles with more or less elaborate bosses. Killing after killing you level up and face waves of increasingly fierce opponents, earning more points but above all collecting money and treasures. The accumulated coins allow you to buy, always during a game, upgrades for the character, such as armor, more powerful weapons or food to restore energy. A very successful idea is the combo meter: killing enemies at a rapid and constant pace increases the value of the coins collected, thus creating a frenetic, relentless and absolutely spot on formula. In order not to find yourself in difficulty in the more advanced ~levels~, you need to unlock the best upgrades in the shortest possible time, but to do this you have to take risks, throw yourself into the fray and make a handful of treasures even at the cost of losing precious energy. Or you can opt for a more cautious approach, with the risk, however, of slowing down the growth of the hero and paying the long-term consequences. There's a subtle strategy to buying upgrades, as you often decide whether to spend some of your loot to regenerate your health or risk and save every coin to buy new weapons first. Yet, unless you are a freak, the ever-increasing waves of monsters eventually overwhelm the player, killing the protagonist and depriving him of all the hard-earned experience, weapons and skills he had earned. . In the next game you start from scratch, but this time you try to surpass the previous record, accumulate more money and go further and further. And who knows, with the right amount of tenacity and patience, you won't be able to get to the end of the hundred levels and the battle with the huge final dragon. At the end of each game you are rewarded with a handful of Fame Points, which can be spent in a separate menu to unlock more or less useful content. These range from a handful of decorations to additional modes (one Advanced and one Boss Run), but most importantly you get access to two additional playable characters, each of which has unique abilities and requires a completely different approach. For example, the Sorceress is unable to jump and is unarmed, but she can transform for an instant into a cyclone with which to make herself invincible and damage enemies, being able to count on alternative magical abilities, such as fireballs and freezing rays. The Villain, on the other hand, protects himself from both sides with two blades, and compensates for his low resistance with a high level of luck, thus managing to collect much more money than the others. Passing from one hero to another, the feeling changes completely, and once all are unlocked, it is the player who can experiment and choose his favourite: in our case, we found it more fun to take on the role of the Sorceress, above all because the need to defend oneself and the learned spells give her a somewhat more active and dynamic role. Compared to the PC original, Schreiber has made an orexcellent work of enrichment, and not only from the graphic point of view or the music created by Matt Cremer: in a similar way to Jetpack Joyride, for each game three different ~missions~ are proposed to be completed, mini-objectives that go, for example, from killing monsters a certain way to surviving without ever jumping. These little challenges not only reward the player with additional Fame Points, but add a little more variety to each game.", "date": "2013-04-08", "grade": "8.8"}
