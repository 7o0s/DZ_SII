{"name": "Northland", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/northland.html", "text": "Every Viking is unique! There is no better phrase than this - which is the title of one of the game's tutorial missions - to indicate the philosophy on which Northland is based. In fact, its strong point - as well as its unique peculiarity - lies precisely in the attention that must be paid to every single element of one's community during the various phases of the campaign. In fact, this strategic places an unusual emphasis on the ~career~ of the Vikings that the player controls, and although it is far from the mix with RPG elements mentioned in the promotional descriptions, it must be admitted that it is a decidedly original and interesting approach. The soldier, the merchant, the simplest laborer cease to be anonymous units produced by this or that structure, always replaceable and of little significance from a global point of view; on the contrary they are all important pieces of your micro-society, each with its own name (which you can even change at will), its own history and many possibilities for evolution. At the start of the campaign you will have control of a handful of untrained civilians, each capable of learning various trades and gaining experience by working. The greater the experience, the better the work performance of the individual character, who with experience will be able to access new levels of skills and new professions. For example, the farmer can become a miller, and then a baker and so on. It is therefore necessary to plan the working structure, training new characters to go and fill the positions left vacant or to increase production. Each character must then have not only a purpose and a profession, but will need a family, a home and a livelihood. And for each of these things it will not be enough to build the canonical Warcraftian farm, but to organize the construction of houses, to make the worker meet a gentle maid and to ensure that they contribute to increasing the birth rate of the population (although I must admit: the option make son/make daughter sounds so bad taste). And so you will have new citizens, you will see them grow and you will be able to decide what their future profession will be. In addition, you will also have to regulate the production of tools, food supplies and equipment (such as shoes, oil and other commonly used goods) to be crammed into warehouses and with which to improve the level of well-being of the population. Every single citizen or soldier will be able to draw from the warehouses to find the necessary objects  if you hadn't understood, they won't do it alone: there is a special interface to manage the equipment (the ~inventory~ if you like) of the single units that you'll have to manage entirely on your own. And then don't complain that it's not a detailed game... Even the expansion of the settlement requires planning. Each building has its own function, and becomes available only if other specific buildings are present, according to a series of technological ~trees~ not unusual for this type of game: starting from the most rudimentary activities, you will move on to the more refined ones, building increasingly more important. In the appropriate menu it will be possible to view which buildings (grouped by activity) are accessible and which are not, and in this case what the necessary requirements are. For each building it is then indicated which products and technologies have been discovered in order to improve the quality of life of the tribe. If the management part is the flagship of this game, it is also true that there are sore points, which we will immediately take into consideration Immo Spappari!! Here you are ! Here comes the fearsome horde of ferocious Viking warriorssort of. The military part of Northland fits into the complex management system just seen, with the difference that for soldiers there are different training structures and times, and you need to have more regard in equipping your men. It is true that an army of nice mustachioed smurfs does not inspire much fear. But it is not so much this that leaves us a little disappointed, as the low weight of the tactical part in the global perspective, which is sacrificed compared to the management aspect of the game. There are three types of units, spearmen, archers and swordsmen. Aside from the experience they gain from fighting, these are the only soldiers you will have, except for heroes. As with civilians, managing each individual soldier will require patience and meticulousness, having to train, equip and assign them to their patrol zone. Then there are the heroes, stronger and above all unique warriors, who will progress in the story in the Campaign, while in the single maps or in the multiplayer they will needjust to give that ounce of extra edge to your troops. It goes without saying that you will need to have a fair number of swords, bows, armor and so on in your warehouses, all supported by blacksmiths, forges and other essential elements of your productive town. It is also possible to recover equipment during battles, collecting them from the corpses of enemies. In this regard, it is perhaps worth emphasizing how the unfolding of a battle is not exactly a very strategic process, given that it is the most approximate component of the game. Soldiers will attack like mad any enemy unit, with little hope for you to direct them precisely. There are no options to manage attack formations or other refinements of the. You will only have the consolation that the survivors, with their baggage of experience, will become stronger and more fearsome warriors, and can be trained in the barracks to gain even more experience. Even the diplomatic part is not developed in depth, presenting only the possibility of deciding with which tribes to be allies, neutrals or enemies, without even providing for a system of treaties and offers or tributes. Comment Northland is an atypical game: it presents certain characteristics in an almost ambitious way, but does not fully satisfy the expectations raised by the premises. It is undeniable that the gameplay structure is decidedly refined, at least as regards the management and organizational aspect. However, it is also true that there are many aspects that leave something to be desired, and which end up ruining the final effect of a product that otherwise would have been really well made. As if to say, the picture is needed, but also the frame; in other words, the concept, original yes, but insufficient, alone is not enough to bring this story of Vikings to the threshold of the videogame Valalla, relegating it to a decidedly inferior position. The graphics certainly aren't up to the highest standards  and I'm not just talking about the cartoony design, which can be passed over  and appear coarse, lacking in detail at the highest zoom factors, and nevertheless manage to weigh down the engine gameplay at critical moments, making it virtually impossible to accurately manage units. Even the sound is not surprising for its originality and variety, remaining average to anonymity, while including a fair range of noises and background effects. In summary I would say that we are dealing with a micro-management game rather than a real time strategic game: a very attractive game for those who let themselves be fascinated by its complexity and want to forge an almost emotional bond with every single bearded Viking in the his city, but which many may not like. Pros: High complexity In-depth management of single units All in all short learning curve Cons: Graphics a bit too coarse The plot of the campaign is not the most original War section not taken care of Fierce Viking warriors or lovable Smurf clones? From the creators of Settlers 2 comes the interesting sequel to Cultures 2, which continues its story right where it left off. A group of heroes, a proud Viking people, a divine conspiracy that will throw the world into chaos. Basically the usual stuff. Except that, in hindsight, there isn't much epic at stake. Watching the pompous introductory movie, one might expect a game with a fierce look and a design worthy of the more serious RTS and instead  instead we find ourselves in the company of many nice big-headed Vikings, chibi versions of Asterix and Obelix or far away mustachioed relatives of the Smurfs Not that this bothers me, but I find that it clashes a little with the pretentious epic atmosphere that we wanted to give to the game. But so be it. The story of the game begins in the distant lands of Arabia, where the hero Sigurd has come to reunite with his former friends, from whom he has been called to help them against an invasion of demonic creatures that threaten their kingdom. Among the different game modes, the Campaign allows you to tackle the missions structured in such a way as to go through the plot up to its epic conclusion, using, among other things, the heroes who are the protagonists of the story. Since the latter is strongly intertwined with events related to the Viking pantheon, it is possible at any time to call up a series of textual extras that tell the various myths and legends of Nordic culture, just to have some knowledge of the facts Then there are also other game modes, as in any self-respecting strategy game. In addition to a well-structured tutorial it is possible to play thevarious maps as single games, or jump into a multiplayer game via LAN or TCP/IP with up to four other players. Finally, there is also a mission and map editor, which allows you to create new scenarios, to be played in single player or multiplayer mode.", "date": "2004-04-01", "grade": null}
