{"name": "Dark Age of Camelot - Ita -", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-age-of-camelot-ita-.html", "text": "For many but not for everyone The healer on Midgard (just to give an example that concerns me closely, no, I'm not a dwarf, but my character does) has three lines of evolution: mending or healing, augmentation that is the casting of spells that enhance your companions and pacification, which would be the ability to block the enemy). The more points you invest in an evolution line and the more powerful spells your trainer will teach you. As in any RPG, there will be quests and drops (items dropped by mobs or monsters) that will allow you to earn valuable wearable or usable items (armor, weapons, rings, gems and much more). Many items will be magical and increase your stats. A fundamental part of the game will therefore be exchanging the collected objects with the other players of the realm, and possibly trading in order to have those that enhance the most important attributes based on the chosen class (there are eight attributes and they are strength, constitution, dexterity , agility, intelligence, empathy, devotion and charisma). The game within your realm obviously offers much more: a series of chats with which to dialogue with other people in the realm, the possibility of learning how to build objects yourself (armor, but also siege objects, of which you I'll talk later and weapons), the ability to move between areas on horseback (walking a realm could take a long time), trade with the vendors you find in each city and much more. For many but not for everyone All this (which basically had already been seen in another online role-playing game) is mounted on an amazing 3D graphics engine (just look at the screenshots). The graphical interface is also excellently done, supported by a command line which enriches its potential (it is also part of the evolution of your character to learn slowly how to use the interface and command line instructions). The surprising thing is that from the first minute you can start having fun, and the exploration of the infinite possibilities that the game offers will be completely gradual (create a personal chat, add a last name, automatically follow a person, ask the guards where someone is found and so on). I realize that I might have already intrigued you, but I still have one card to play in favor of Daoc (then the flaws will come too): the three realms are not completely separate.. You won't believe that the ultimate goal of making your character evolve is to kill the monsters of the realm faster? Of course not. Each realm has borders where in addition to the usual mobs, you can also find invaders from other realms. Invaders are your primary enemy and it is to fight them that you have trained within your realm. The ultimate goal of the game, however, is to defend the keeps within your own border and try to occupy the keeps in the enemy borders and bring two relics (which are located within the most defended enemy keeps) into your realm. Bringing relics into one's territory, in addition to bringing honor to one's land, will give bonuses to all fighters in one's realm. The game is structured in all its parts in order to favor the interaction with other players and if I have to be honest the strength of Daoc is given by the players themselves (and the program from this point of view is an excellent means of interaction between people who want to have fun). Conclusions I certainly can not overlook the flaws of this game: the evolution of your character is quite slow and often the effort to pass the level (level up) is frustrating. If you bear in mind that when you die you will lose experience (in practice you lose part of the progress you have made), you will understand that there is a possibility that the player will get nervous (often sending the hell out of the party mates he was fighting with, perhaps guilty I've made some mistakes). Another small problem is the heaviness of the engine, which in the presence of many characters (it happens for example when you try to attack an enemy keep) becomes unsustainable and makes the gaming experience decidedly unusable if you don't have a powerful computer last generation. In addition to a bad memory management (after a couple of hours of play, the framerate drops dramatically) and some minor engine bugs (rarely the character gets stuck somewhere), I have to point out a good Italian translation of the game (too bad only having to wait months before having the patches: the slowness and the massive translation work forces the italian serveror to have a version of the game that is significantly older than the American version). P.S. Daoc is one of those things that is addictive (perhaps worse than drugs), but for the very modest price of around ten euros a month you will have access to the Italian game server (where at least a thousand players meet every night). See you on Midgard, and if you meet a grim-eyed dwarf healer wielding a purple hammer, that's me (and if you're invaders, run away.. or I'll be forced to). Mmorpg, more than an RPG I had already written the classic review that is used to do for all other games. But rereading it I realized that it didn't focus attention on what Dark Age Of Camelot really is. I start this new draft starting with the most important thing: Daoc is not a game, but a multiplayer experience built on rpg foundations. I speak of experience and not of game because once you enter the persistent world of Daoc, you will forget that you are playing on the computer (with a keyboard and a mouse, behind a monitor). You will be one of the many characters of your boundless realm (there are three of them, Albion, Midgard and Hibernia, all three completely different graphically). Your life will be dedicated to your realm (the only one you can play in after choosing it at the beginning of the game). Your life will be dedicated mainly to training the art of combat (depending on the class and race chosen, your style of play will vary). You can be a Midgardian warrior troll (strong in hand-to-hand combat and resistant, but very slow), you can be a Firbolga shadow on Hibernia (fight without being seen and attack enemies by surprise), or you can impersonate an Albion Breton sorcerer ( with the ability to manipulate the elements of fire, ice, earth, and air). Each realm has a dozen selectable classes (ranging from wizards to warriors, from healers to archers), 4 races and infinite overall combinations. In fact, by killing the monsters that you will find in your realm you will earn points that will allow you to decide how to evolve the character.", "date": "2002-06-05", "grade": null}
