{"name": "F-Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f-zero_a.html", "text": "Game menu Grand Prix The fulcrum mode of F-Zero, in which to engage in authentic last-boost battles against ruthless opponents in grand prix structured in five tracks for each of the three classes. VS Battle As the name of this feature explicitly recalls, it is a race against human opponents, with the possibility of racing in all available tracks. Time Attack It's a fight against time where, to get the best times, you will have to hone your skills in search of the perfect trajectories. Practice It's the classic way to practice and memorize the various layouts. Story Structured in missions with interludes in FMV this mode offers a great diversification from the GP, placing the player in different situations that will require all kinds of skills. Customize Where you can buy Story missions, as well as the components to assemble your own cars and customize them using textures already supplied or creating them from scratch. Options Where to make all the necessary settings. Unfortunately in this circumstance the sub-menus are totally in Japanese. Profile The story of every driver featured in the game. Here too we note, with great regret, the exclusive presence of oriental characters. The very first screen after the Gamecube logo is certainly electrifying: the Nintendo and Sega brands, stacked on top of each other, together to highlight a strong, massive collaboration. Veteran players will get a gasp for this, for sure. Having reviewed all the sentimentalities of the case, we arrive at the presentation screen and, after having ~pressed~ the start as requested, we enter the game menu, all in English and made up of nine icons, three of which will certainly attract attention of users: Grand Prix, Story, Customize. The GP mode is the classic one of the old episodes, in which you compete shoulder to shoulder against fierce opponents on each track and within a ranking that will be updated after each challenge. Always in perfect style with the prequels is also the subdivision into cups, which will initially be three and will boast five slopes each: the Ruby Cup will be the competition in which the difficulty of the slopes will rise decidedly gradually, mixing less difficult slopes with others slightly more difficult; the Sapphire Cup will be the intermediate competition, in which the tracks will offer much more than an obstacle; the Emerald Cup for its part will be the competition that, among the three, will offer the most difficult slopes. Furthermore, before entering the race, the level of difficulty will also be requested, initially divided between Novice, Standard and Expert, which will influence the AI of the opponents, making them increasingly aggressive and faster. The task of diversifying the game action will be up to the Story mode, a real new entry in the world of F-Zero. The structure is based on missions, the latter interspersed with FMVs that will see the key character of the game, or Captain Falcon, juggle the various situations, which will range from the funniest to the most dangerous. The missions will require all kinds of skills, varying each time in order to train the player to complete the game successfully. However, it will not be rose water like the canonical tutorials, far from it, it will be a challenge in which to give free rein to one's pilot skills, in a succession of circumstances that will require an abundance of skills and reflexes. If the first test will essentially be nothing more than a circuit to be completed in the pre-established time by choosing the best trajectories, from the second onwards everything will change: from the unpublished scenarios to the required skills. At the end of each mission successfully completed, as well as at the end of each grand prize won, points will be awarded, real bargaining chips in the shop within the Customize mode. It will thus be possible to buy the unlocked Story missions, new cars to drive as well as the mechanical parts necessary to build your own car, divided into three categories: the driver's seat, the car body and the reactors. In order to assemble a machine, all you have to do is buy a piece for each species, carefully looking at the characteristics of each one such as weight, grip, speed and resistance. The characteristics will be judged using the US voting system, which will go from the lowest E to the highest A. In order to build a respectable machine, it will therefore be necessary not to overdo the weight and try to obtain, in the general characteristics, sufficiently good marks. tall. Once the car of your dreams has been designed, it will be time to customize it, thanks to an editor that will put auser's disposal prefabricated textures to be applied on the car as well as the possibility of creating them from scratch, through a sort of paint that will bring to mind the much acclaimed Animal Crossing. The time has therefore come to warm up the engines and get out on the track, and to do this, just look a few lines further down. We have just left behind a paragraph full of features, where Sega has really outdone itself to give the game that pinch of variety necessary to keep the player's interest perennially alive. But all these appetizing features would be nothing if there weren't a solid driving game at the base, able to keep up the challenge and motivate the user more and more to go beyond any barrier, beyond any limit... but let's go step by step . Before each race it will be essential, using a handy graph, to select the setting of your car according to the track you are going to race on, in fact you can opt for more massive acceleration at the expense of top speed or viceversa. Once this is done, we get on the track. The game screen is divided into various icons representing the faces of the six drivers who lead the race, our position, the state of health of the vehicle and the speed at which we are proceeding. In Grand Prix mode there will be three laps to be completed for each circuit, where only once the finish line of the first lap has been crossed will the car boosts be enabled, attributed to the Y key, which will draw on the car's own energy. In the first lap it will therefore be necessary to lose the least number of boosts present on the various tracks, also because the opponents, especially in the Expert level, will hardly let one slip away. From the second lap onwards, the question will literally become more difficult, as, in addition to choosing the most advantageous trajectories, a wise use of the boost integrated into the car will be necessary. The boost is nothing more than a violent acceleration capable of taking the vehicle to maximum speed, so its use before a tight curve or a steep hairpin could be regrettable, while it is highly recommended in the straights or in the final rushes. A wise use of the boost is one of the keys to becoming a great F-Zero driver, requiring a considerable strategic component. The energy of the car will also be logically affected by impacts against the guard rails and opposing cars, where, thanks to the X key, it will be possible to create a barrier capable of repelling the opponents' clashes with the help of the left analog stick. In addition to this it will be possible to perform real attacks, with Z and the left stick, in which your car will become an authentic top capable of causing damage to the opponent and, depending on the impact, even knocking him out of the race. The other pilots will also be able to make attacks and barriers, especially in the more difficult levels where the AI will be at the top. The A and B keys are assigned respectively the accelerator and the brake, while the steep steering is assigned to the L and R backbones. There will be many types of view, selectable via the directional cross, which will range from subjective to purely top view, even if in the latter there are some framing problems in tunnel passages and whenever a structure passes over us . The track design is the most beautiful and complex ever seen in such a game, and here we have to bow down, for the umpteenth time, to Sega. Each track is made unique by the myriad of components that characterize, and have characterized in due course, F-Zero; a world characterized by pyrotechnic leaps, sandbanks, loop-the-loops, spins, waxes, claustrophobic tunnels and we could go on and on. What makes all this truly unique is the expertise put by AV and Nintendo to properly assemble all these elements. Everything is in the right place at the right time. Technically speaking we are faced with an authentic showdown by Sega, Nintendo and its home console. The thirty cars on the screen whiz around the F-Zero circuits at blazing speeds, where it is precisely the sensation of going at such speeds that causes a sensation. The 1000 and more kilometers per hour are all felt on the skin with an almost disarming fluidity, granite nailed to 60 frames per second even in multiplayer, when the screen will split into two or more boxes. It has a certain effect to see a game from the coF-Zero's polygonal complexity won't miss a single frame along the way. In fact, if the cars are made with a certain care without however impressing, the backdrops are the most futuristic ever seen on consoles. Architecturally impressive, the backdrops are anything but static, offering a truly impressive eye-catcher. In fact, we will pass through tornadoes of sand and giant worms in Sand ocean, neon and holograms in Mute City, giant chips and centurion statues in Vegas Palace, thunder and lightning in Lighting, lava and blazes of fire in Fire Field. All in the name of style, a futuristic style bordering on the psychedelic. Furthermore, the quality of the textures is of the highest level both for what concerns the backdrops and for the cars, where the textures will be applicable, in perfect Panini sticker style, following the various ripples of the vehicles. Even the polygonal models of the various characters, visible during the selection, are decidedly accurate and offer hilarious animations. Some points are lost by the sound sector which offers remixed versions of the most characteristic songs of the prequels, as well as new tracks that range between a couple of musical genres. Unfortunately, apart from a few decidedly well-crafted pieces, such as the initial track and the legendary one of Mute City, the others wander through rather anonymous conduits, without towing or respecting that adrenaline with which the game is cloaked. Final comment What to say about a game that borders on perfection if not: ~Buy it with your eyes closed~. Of course, the genre may or may not like it, but this test of power by Sega and Nintendo could literally bring anyone closer to this type of game. An imposing challenge which, however, is never frustrating, constantly stimulating the player to make evolutions considered, at first, unimaginable. However, the advice is to wait for a version in an understandable language, the US one on the doorstep, in order to enjoy every gem that the game has to offer without having to grope for the menus almost entirely in Japanese. F-Zero is back, this time cubed. Pros: Stunning graphics. A challenge from another time. Long lived. In multiplayer it's a blast. Cons: Sound not always up to par. Assuming that we have in our hands a dictionary of synonyms and antonyms exclusively based on the world of video games, going to browse the pages concerning the F, under the heading F-Zero we will find a few but representative words: speed, adrenaline, challenge. The latest generations of Nintendo consoles have all boasted in their line up at least one chapter of this now legendary futuristic racing arcade, and, once again, the big N does not deny itself by bringing one of its historic franchises to the Gamecube, this time called F-Zero GX for the occasion and twin brother of AX designed especially for arcades in the noble attempt to relaunch the coin op in the world. In recent times Nintendo has developed a policy which, if it hadn't brought excellent results, would certainly have ended up under fierce accusation, namely delegating world-famous third parties for the development of some of its flagship brands. It happened for Capcom, it happened for Namco and, for this F-Zero GX, it happened for Sega; more precisely Amusement Vision, one of the nine divisions inside the house of the blue hedgehog, which more than once has demonstrated its particular feeling for the Gamecube. Heavy burden therefore for AV to bring, in close collaboration with Nintendo, F-Zero to the top and above all at maximum speed.", "date": "2003-08-04", "grade": null}
