The Russians of Gaijin Entertainment apparently are particularly fond of their heroine, so much so that they want to re-propose her as the protagonist of their latest effort which can be considered in all respects as a sort of spiritual sequel to the previous title, with which however it shows since the at first glance a clear stylistic discontinuity. Blades of Time has had a troubled gestation since its inception. In fact, the developers had their work cut out to find a publisher for their action game project focused mainly on the ability to manipulate time which appeared too cumbersome in the eyes of many insiders. The success of games such as Braid was providential, which convinced Konami to patronize the Russian Gaijin, making it possible for Ayumi to return to the home consoles that first knew her. Fantasy stereotypes The contextualization of the narrative component of Blades of Time immediately appears just enough, enough to support the action and the fighting representing the true heart of the production as a pretext. In an unspecified guild of warriors are waiting for their chance to enter the dimension of Dragonland, a place where it is said there are priceless treasures and great power for those who venture there. Before the ritual reaches its climax, Ayumi and her partner Zero burst into the scene and, thanks to the use of force, it is precisely the busty blonde who is able to use the magical sphere that catapults her into the dreamlike dimension of Dragonland , intent on obtaining the legendary treasure of the Dragon Temple. Certainly originality was not a priority for the screenwriters but after all in an action game the fundamental characteristics on which to concentrate efforts all reside in the playful component, which in Blades of Time offers peculiar characteristics. The combat system is based on the use of two keys, one used for the blows of Ayumi's inseparable twin swords and the other for kicks and choreographed pirouettes, the combination of these two commands translates into a frenetic, rapid and dynamic ballet, thanks also the absence of a parry, replaced by a sudden sprint useful for evading the attacks of the opponents and subsequently also for jumping on selected enemies. With such athletic and offensive skills Ayumi proves to be a perfect adventuress, less convincing is the feeling that the actions on the screen transmit, with each jump the protagonist looks like a crazed splinter making the few and elementary platform sessions extremely difficult only because the leap parable. Even the blows inflicted and those suffered do not convey the necessary physicality so that the actual damage inflicted and the one suffered is not always well understood, risking falling into frivolous button smashing for its own sake. Alongside the edged weapons, a rifle is soon added, useful for ranged combat but with a not too happy semi-automatic aiming and control system which, slowing down the movements of the protagonist and making it impossible to dodge during aiming mode, clashes a little with the dynamism and speed that represents one of the most appreciable characteristics of the entire production. Continuing the adventure, Ayumi can acquire new techniques and spells, active and passive, through some altars to which she can donate the souls of slain enemies. In truth, the number of souls collected is not quantified at all and the obtaining of new skills occurs automatically whenever new altars are found along the levels. We even soon notice how rapid the acquisition of new offensive skills is, given the numerous altars we are going to encounter, so that the player finds himself in the paradoxical situation of having an oversized range of techniques without ever having the possibility of exploiting them all and metabolize its effects through experience. Each new spell is exploited by filling sections of the fury bar, which can also be used for the healing function and, through combinations of the two attack and/or jump keys, unfortunately, in the midst of the most agitated action it can happen that the game literally lose some of our commands nullifying the combos or worse still the recourse to the curative action leading to frustrating game overs, a symptom of a lack of optimization of the mechanics which in a combat system necessarily need to be as perfect as possible to enhance albeit good starting points. Xbox 360 goals There are 17 obiesActive secrets to unlock, mostly related to story progress. The rest of the points can be obtained by killing multiple enemies at the same time, doing their utmost in combos and collecting objects and weapons found in the chests. The unlockable loot in the multiplayer component is small. I think I'm a clone now As the title suggests, Blades of Time focuses much of the attention on Ayumi's ability to be able to rewind time. However, this feature does not materialize in a similar way to what was seen with the Sands of Time by the prince of Persia but rather is more similar to the dynamics seen in the small masterpiece Braid. Ayumi, in fact, by rewinding time, will create one or more clones of herself that will faithfully replicate her latest actions, obviously the greater the number of aliases created and the shorter their duration. This ability proves to be useful and well exploited against some enemies equipped with a frontal shield that need to be circumvented by keeping them busy fighting with one of our clones, or to face those creatures equipped with a magical barrier that become vulnerable if subjected to a higher sustained rate of fire Ayumi shooting at the same time. Time manipulation also proves to be useful for solving some elementary puzzles, among which the best use of this skill occurs during a desert section where the use of clones will allow the protagonist to manage the shadows that protect her from the scorching sun. however of sporadic cases compared to a much more frequent recurrence during the fights, especially when we are called to face very numerous groups of enemies. Managing aliases is initially cumbersome, so a little initial practice is required to become familiar with this fundamental function. Definitely unjustifiable is the bad camera that follows the action and that often does its utmost in absolutely meaningless shots, revealing how it is very difficult for her to follow Ayumi's rapid movements, all of which is aggravated by the absence of a key that shows the camera behind the protagonist's back which would have at least partially mitigated the serious shortcomings of the game's direction. During the adventure as a good treasure seeker Ayumi can, thanks to the help of a special compass, find chests containing various types of treasures, from new weapons to accessories that influence the protagonist's skills, while along the levels she proves interesting to recover the pages of the diaries of the adventurers who preceded Ayumi who tell us about their experiences in the singular dimension of Dragonland. Western Ayumi In addition to the renewed combat system Blades of Time stands out from its predecessor also and above all for the new design that characterizes the game, abandoned the cell-shading, which had brought X-Blades so much closer to the iconographic imagery typical of Japanese manga, now Ayumi sports a realization closer to the western style that best marries with the fantasy universe from which the entire production draws with both hands, without even bothering to decline everything in an original and personal key. The lack of artistic work is most felt in the creation of the enemies, uninspired and too often recycled, accompanied by a deficient Artificial Intelligence that shows its worst when we take full advantage of Ayumi's time management power. In general, the technical realization of the entire production does not cry out to a miracle, with a just sufficient polygonal mass and an almost spasmodic and invasive use by the bloom lighting system and a color contrast sometimes pushed towards the excess. Inexplicable are the frequent drops in framerate often unjustified by the presence of a few characters on the screen and the animations linked to each other in a coarse and not very harmonious way, while satisfying the light effects that always abundantly accompany the dynamic melee clashes. The rendering of the landscapes is a bit fluctuating where, in the face of all in all repetitive and uninspired internal settings, evocative and dreamlike landscapes alternate which represent peaks of excellence in environmental characterization which, if not maintained for the entire duration of the game, all in all they almost always offer a pleasant epic and evocativeness. A separate task goes to the brand new multiplayer mode (both cooperative and versus) which focuses on deathmatches where the goal is to destroy the opponent's tree of chaos. In the multiplayer component, the ability to manage time disappears for obvious reasons, replaced by a sort of fury mode that increases the offensive capabilities of the variousAyumi and there is also a system of rewards and skills that can be obtained by collecting kills, bonuses that become available only at the next respawn, mortifying the wait-and-see and prudent conduct of players who only rarely die in combat. All in all, it is an accessory mode without too many pretensions, characterized by the particular length of the clashes which can sometimes be seen to last even for half hours of continuous action.", "date": "2012-03-23", "grade": "5.8"}
