Dream League Soccer 2017 can therefore move with complete peace of mind, without resting on its laurels, and offer exactly those modes and features that football enthusiasts expect from such a product: solid gameplay, convincing ball physics, of the multifaceted and intuitive team, as well as the ability to try your hand at both a lengthy ~Master League~ style mode and a well-implemented multiplayer. The main screen allows you to continue the championship, challenge another user online, start transfers using the virtual money earned (by catching athletes from the present or the past) and finally manage the team in various areas: enhance players by investing in certain skills, check the achievements, change the formation, carry out a training session and even modify the city stadium so that it can guarantee more income. In short, a side dish of a certain thickness, capable of embodying that sense of growth and progression that will accompany our dream team towards success... inevitably passing through some bitter defeat! Dream League Soccer 2017 is a fun, solid and well-structured soccer game Pass the ball Once on the pitch, Dream League Soccer 2017 confirms the merits of a system that First Touch has further refined, although at first it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the reactions of the ball to our solicitations. The three buttons on the right side of the touch screen allow you to pass, cross and shoot when we have possession of the ball, otherwise they are responsible for tackling, tackling and changing the player. Loading each shot increases the degree of simulation of the experience, which therefore does not allow you to proceed towards the opponent's area with very rapid exchanges, but at the same time leaves the through balls, which are not always punctual, a little to chance. The orientation of the shot requires a little practice to be able to hit the goal, but when you ~take the measurements~ of these mechanisms, finishing and maybe scoring becomes a real pleasure, as per tradition for football games of a certain quality. The artificial intelligence of the teammates is unfortunately not beyond reproach and it happens that an opponent manages to cross our half of the pitch without major problems, but beyond this the players' reactivity appears to be discreet compared to the indications we can provide them, giving the team a more aggressive, balanced or defensive approach. The management of the strategies, the module and the changes is extremely simple and immediate, but Dream League Soccer 2017 gets along also from a technical point of view, thanks to graphics that are certainly not as detailed as that of FIFA, but nonetheless fluid and discreetly cared for.", "date": "2017-03-22", "grade": "7.8"}
