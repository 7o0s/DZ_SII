{"name": "Vane", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vane-recensione.html", "text": "Those who follow the indie scene with some attention will probably remember having heard of Vane for quite some time: the announcement is even from mid-2014, with a few more details that emerged at the Tokyo Game Show of the same year. Traces of him were then lost for a long time until the PlayStation Experience 2016, during which he reappeared with a new trailer. Another 12 months in silence to arrive at the 2017 edition of the same event when something more concrete had been seen, to then conclude last December with finally the release date, set for this January. In summary, it took about 5 years of development by the Friend & Foe team, an independent software house based in Tokyo (but made up of Westerners) with a curriculum work on stuff like The Last Guardian, Battlefield 3, Bionic Commando and Killzone . With premises like that, what could go wrong? Setting and scenery In summary: everything. Well, perhaps we are exaggerating, but the truth is that Vane is a huge, burning and painful disappointment, as well as the plastic representation of a type of independent game that tries to hide very serious game design problems under the veneer of a specious and at times cloying. The formula is essentially that of ~ICO~ games, although there are also obvious influences from Thatgamecompany and Playdead titles: the fundamental difference is that if in ICO, Flower, Journey, Limbo and Inside the aesthetic value was correctly supported on the one hand playful at least adequate for the purpose, although never the protagonist, in Vane the rarefied atmospheres and evocative graphics are like an empty and cold skeleton, without substance. The themes, allusive and never fully explained during the entire adventure, see as the main protagonist a bird with dark plumage capable of transforming, coming into contact with a magical golden powder, into a boy without a name or a voice. There are no dialogues or texts in Vane, leaving the player with the possibility of interpreting the meaning of a large part of the message delivered by Friend & Foe. The absence of a plot is certainly not an a priori defect, mind you, but it is inevitable to wonder whether this kind of narrative choices (or rather, non-choices) actually hide a subtext to be discovered or if they are not rather a clever way of exit from the responsibility of telling something interesting, or at least tangible and concrete. The fact is that the first few minutes in front of Vane are unquestionably pleasant, because they allow us to appreciate the desolation and misery of a world represented in an undoubtedly inspired way: if in the boy's first steps in a setting that seems to fall apart an overwhelming sense of anguish is inevitably felt underfoot, a few moments later it is in the flight of the bird over a desert, between arid mountains and deep canyons, that on the contrary one can feel a freedom that only creatures that are not anchored to the ground they can taste. All this represented through graphics that are certainly not sumptuous (indeed) on a technical level, but strong in a valuable style, which renounces textures and rich effects to replicate this depressing scenario in an effective and rather original way through the shaders. However, it is necessary to point out even heavy frame rate uncertainties also on PS4 Pro, as well as various imperfections probably the result of a very little cleaned up code. Gameplay with great difficulty In short, Vane from a graphic point of view has style and character, little to do. However, it seems that all the team's resources have flowed solely into this component, or rather that within Friend & Foe there are too many artists and few game designers. The flight sequences already show enormous limitations in terms of controls: slow, heavy and imprecise despite the fact that the bird's capabilities are actually very limited. In addition to being able to beat its wings to gain altitude, in fact, the animal can only land by leaning on certain areas and call any other birds with its song. Already the simple action of perching on the aforementioned points is an often unnerving effort, with the movements that seem closer to those of a tank than a light bird. In such an unrefined picture, the camera is then added, totally unable to effectively follow the action and position itself in the most useful angle, requiring continuous manual corrections. It doesn't go any better then in the role of the young human, because even in this case the movements always turn out to be tiring, imprecise, slippery and tremendously frustrating. If hidden under unfortunate controls there was an interesting game, it could all in all close an orcchio: unfortunately the reality of the facts is quite different. Vane from the perspective of level design and mechanics has few ideas, almost all modest both in intrinsic value and in realization. Trivial and repetitive environmental puzzles are structured in an incomprehensible way on a purely playful level, often forcing the player to wander for endless minutes within the large and dispersive environments in search of an object with which to interact in order to continue. It is useless to create such large areas to visit if there is practically nothing inside them. The result is a boring, very slow, irritating development, which makes the very modest overall longevity of the adventure seem like a blessing: assuming that everything goes smoothly, in fact, 3 hours are enough to get to the indecipherable final scene. Yes because, as if that weren't enough, Vane also suffers from the presence of devastating bugs, unacceptable after such a long development and within such a ~small~ game. In our experience we were faced with a scene between depressing and exhilarating, with the poor boy who, instead of walking normally at any moment, found himself practically lying down. This bizarre form of walking lasted a few minutes, after which the protagonist simply became invisible. Finding it impossible to continue further in this situation, we chose to exit to the title screen and reload, dramatically discovering that managing checkpoints is something unthinkable, which forces us to repeat huge sections of the game. Probably the only aspect of Vane free from criticism is that of the soundtrack, actually inspired and evocative, but which can do little in the face of so many weaknesses.", "date": "2019-01-18", "grade": "4.0"}
