{"name": "Il legame della famiglia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/172495-bound-il-legame-della-famiglia.html", "text": "Bound is a story of childhood fears, of family, of fragility, of disappointment, of anger, of forgiveness and reconquest. The protagonist is a young woman during the last days of a pregnancy: a fundamental moment in her life, destined to mark a turning point and therefore inevitably the bearer of thoughts and reflections on what will be and what has been. Many of us have boulders on our hearts, unresolved issues that willy-nilly affect our being: Bound revolves around one of them, with a concreteness capable of arousing a certain empathy in a large portion of the potential audience destined to play with it. The ~real~ world, in which the future mother walks very slowly on a beach the few steps that separate her from a mysterious house, represents the glue between the various levels that make up the adventure and which represent the most strictly playful part of the work of Plastic Studios. The Polish team, already author of the artistic experiment Linger in Shadows for PlayStation 3 and of the (slightly) more conventional Datura (the latter product linked to the certainly not unforgettable PlayStation Move peripheral), is not exactly a software house dedicated solely to the development of video games: the main activity of the long-lived group, founded in 1997, is in fact that of creating demos in computer graphics for various purposes, including an installation in the stand of one's country within Expo 2015 or the Catzilla PC benchmark. With a curriculum so lateral to the gaming field, the full success of Bound would actually have been a great surprise, and all this despite the fact that the publication under the Santa Monica Studio label and above all the first contact made a few months ago had left us some hope on the actual success of the project. Bound is an extraordinary audiovisual experience, which however offers too little from a playful point of view Dance is the solution Bound is an indie game that brings with it some of the typical stylistic features of the category, starting from the intimate plot to the creative and original approach as regards the artistic component. From this last point of view, the title of Plastic Studios deserves applause not only for the courage, but also for the effective final realization: turning a blind eye to the short and limited sections in the ~real world~, actually modest from the point of view technical to the point of being able to probably be managed on a PlayStation 3, the actual levels that make up the adventure are capable of leaving even the least sensitive users amazed from the first moment. Not so much for the stable 1080p and 60 frames per second, which in any case undoubtedly represent an element of value, but rather for the graphic approach adopted which clearly and indisputably recalls the works of Piet Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and more generally of the movement of Neoplasticism and Bauhaus, Suprematism and Concretism, of course with all due respect. The world in which the Princess moves, the heroine of this alternative reality who represents the alter ego of the pregnant woman, is in fact composed entirely of geometric shapes: parallelepipeds and triangles, spheres and trapezoids and a whole series of naked polyhedrons, with solid that give an extremely fascinating sense of coldness and desolation. Not only that: most of the elements on the screen change and move continuously, perhaps with the backdrop literally pulsing to the rhythm of the music or with structures, stairs and platforms that recompose themselves in front of your eyes a few moments before the passage of the 'heroin. It is certainly not a solution destined to meet everyone's taste, yet the aseptic and squared world of Bound nevertheless reveals itself as rich in personality and character, even if inevitably destined to appear a bit repetitive in the long run despite the efforts of the Polish artists. The plot revolves around a kingdom that is being destroyed by a huge and evil monster, and the Queen who entrusts her daughter with the hopes of salvation that pass through a surreal journey full of symbolism. An interesting aspect of the production of Santa Monica Studio is the possibility of tackling the levels in the order one prefers: each of them is in fact represented by the page of a notebook of drawings that the woman carries with her during the walk, and which can be found then to browse during stops. Each level represents a fear to be defeated, with that page which is then torn out in a sort of psychoanalysis whose meaning can only be understood at the end of the adventure. Within this dreamlike, stylized, hostile and disturbing world,the most effective element of Plastic Studios' work lies in the contrast with the elegance of the Princess, whose splendid and complex movements are those of a classical dancer walking on tiptoe, ethereal, as if pushed by a light saving breeze. The dance, as you will soon learn, is also the tool thanks to which the Princess can overcome the obstacles she will be destined to encounter during the levels: we are talking about ~obstacles~ and not enemies because in all respects the latter do not exist in Bound, and obviously consequently there are no fights, just as no real challenge factor is perceptible other than that of overcoming the platform sections. Not just graphics? The development of the play areas is in fact very linear and guided, so in essence it is simply a matter of going from point A to point B, dedicating oneself above all to appreciating the artistic work that supports the work, accompanied by the exciting soundtrack played on the piano. In reality, however, this also constitutes the main and most serious defect of the product, since the heavy imbalance towards the aesthetic component struggles to hide the shortcomings regarding the game design that inevitably emerge during the adventure. Let me be clear, we have nothing against games focused on history, ~walking simulators~ to be clear: the most recent example of ABZU, just to mention the latest arrival, confirms how even a so-called ~non-game~ can represent a experience of great depth and which deserves full consideration. But in Bound there are aspects that clash, starting with the same platform elements that should represent the main tool to move the product away from the world of demos and move it towards that of real videogames: the imprecision in the management of jumps, of the detection of contact zones and in the positioning of the camera make these passages often frustrating, despite the more than permissive management of the checkpoints which actually allows you to start over from exactly the same point. More generally, the levels are practically devoid of any interaction component, save for a handful of switches to flip and very little else. A cosmic void that soon makes the progression boring, as well as extremely repetitive: beyond the graphic differences between the individual levels - among other things destined to change according to the order in which they are faced -, all maintain substantially the same features without introducing any significant changes in game mechanics. The result is a monotonous progress of the entire adventure, strictly cyclical in its development (crossing the level, final dance to defeat the specific Fear, return to the beginning through a sort of long orange toboggan, vision of memory), which leaves the bitter in the mouth once the end credits are reached after just two hours. Little changes the presence of a level design full of numerous alternative roads and shortcuts to discover, since there is no real stimulus or gratification in going to look for them except that linked to the inappropriate Speed Run mode, to be unlocked once completed the game. More sensible is instead the one for photos, full of options and filters, thanks to which Bound can become an almost infinite source of extraordinary and evocative shots.", "date": "2016-08-15", "grade": "6.7"}
