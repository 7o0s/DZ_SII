What better occasion to launch a tie-in on the App Store and Google Play that includes not only the new characters, but also those of the classic television series, in a similar way to what was done a couple of months ago by Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Mega Battle ? Made by nWay and characterized by the traditional freemium format, Power Rangers: Legacy Wars offers a roster that sees the presence of old and new Rangers, with a view to multiplayer battles in real time with a progression very similar to that of the blockbuster Clash Royale : winning fights raises the level and allows you to obtain new cards with which to enhance your roster, passing to different scenarios after passing a certain level of experience. At first glance, the approach of the game seems the same as Marvel Contest of Champions, therefore an immediate frenetic gestural beat 'em up. However, things are different, as the clashes take place within a strategic system based on a set of cards that appear in random order in the lower part of the screen. An interesting, but also effective solution? Power Rangers: Legacy Wars is an interesting tie-in for fans of the series, but with some limitations It's morphing time! After completing a tutorial to learn the mechanics behind Power Rangers: Legacy Wars it is possible to dive into online multiplayer, which as mentioned works in real time and is not regulated by timers or anything else. The matchmaking is quite fast, and once on the field you put yourself in command of the leader of a team made up of three elements, two of which, however, only act as support and can only be called into action using the related cards. The combat system is precisely that of a card battler, but the action takes place ~live~ and it is therefore necessary to decide very quickly which moves to make, according to rather simple rules: the standard attacks can be blocked by the parry, but the latter it is broken by a breaker, but it is slow and leaves it vulnerable to standard hits. A ~circular~ solution that guarantees a minimum of tactical depth to the fights, given that at all times you have to think about which maneuver to perform, spending the energy points which recharge after a few moments and are indicated in the central part of the screen. But be careful: our opponent will do the same and could therefore perform counter-moves capable of literally cornering us and making us vulnerable to a devastating combo. Beyond the fights, the outline of the game is rich and includes the objects that are obtained after each match, the power-ups, the possibility of unlocking new characters and of developing up to three different teams. Unfortunately after a while the gameplay turns out to be repetitive and ambiguous situations are noticed, such as users who passively suffer our blows and others who instead, having spent some money, have substantially more effective attacks than ours. A pity, because the idea behind Power Rangers: Legacy Wars is interesting, even more so if you are a fan of the series produced by Saban, and is supported by a well-made technical sector, with detailed and fairly animated characters.", "date": "2017-03-29", "grade": "7.0"}
