{"name": "Dysmantle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dysmantle-recensione.html", "text": "The Finnish team 10Tons has already demonstrated its ability to expertly build game experiences starting from even slightly abused structures and it does not contradict itself even with survival horror with crafting elements, as we see in this Dysmantle review. Framing the game is not easy: its characteristics are all known, almost abused at this point, but the authors of Neonchrome and Tesla vs. Lovecraft have managed to amalgamate them in a truly optimal way into something peculiar. Basically it's a crafting party, but everything is placed within a large and stimulating setting, also supported by a truly irresistible progression system. The result is a survival game that also has something Diablo in the combat system and constant search for loot, all inserted in a mechanism of growth and expansion of construction possibilities that inserts us into a sort of web of possibilities and paths to follow to strengthen the protagonist and find new solutions to fight and survive the apocalypse. The premise is as classic as possible: after running out of supplies, the protagonist comes out of a bunker in which he has been closed for a long period of time to escape an unidentified catastrophe. The outside world is now destroyed and humanity has turned into zombie-like creatures (or more precisely to the infected of The Last of Us), but there seems to be hope in a mysterious evacuation system communicated through the radio systems that remained active. The aim of the game is therefore to abandon the island where we find ourselves, completing a series of missions that allow you to activate the evacuation systems and at the same time exploring the huge setting to obtain the resources necessary to achieve the goal. Everything is represented as a third-person action with a top view and variable framing by the player, with a characterization halfway between realistic and cartoonish and with a considerable variety of settings to explore. Explore, destroy and build Dysmantle, an image of a typical situation in the game The distinctive feature of Dysmantle is the possibility of destroying practically anything, with the right tool, to obtain more or less rare and precious materials to invest in the construction of new objects. From this point of view, more than a typical survival it is somewhat reminiscent of the basic mechanism of Terraria or Minecraft, with the compulsive collection of resources that remains a constant throughout the game. It starts with a crowbar with limited power, but later it is possible to upgrade it and also obtain other tools to destroy more resistant objects and materials and obtain further precious resources, to be invested in turn in the construction of objects, in the enhancement of existing ones and discovering new equipment. The gameplay loop is always the same: exploration, destruction of objects (with clearly visible results in the configuration of the scenarios), collection of materials and return to the camp to recharge energy and construction, upgrading and inventory management. certainly a repetitive and very little original mechanism, but it is paced in such a way as to be irresistible: free exploration allows you to reach very different environments, opening the door to the collection of new materials and therefore further construction possibilities, while the quantity of unlockable items and power-ups is impressive and allows for constant progression. To all this are also added some elements of lore that lead us to investigate abandoned houses and buildings in search of information on what has happened to the world and on possible escape routes, with quests to complete that also place us in front of situations quite different from each other, complete with puzzles to solve and mysteries related to the ancient origins of the island in which we find ourselves. Fight and survive Dysmantle, image with a section of fishing In addition to destruction and construction, the other constant element of the gameplay is the fight against the various mutant monsters that infest the area. These are creatures with different characteristics and fighting styles, ranging from the classic zombie with melee attacks to more sophisticated monsters capable of attacking from a distance with acid jets and other solutions, which require the use of different approaches and weapons . These are not exactly creative or very demanding clashes, being essentially based on the right timing in delivering blows and in using dodging, but the variety of beings that can be found still makes exploration quite stimulating and also requires the use ofdifferent weapons, as happens especially in correspondence with the bosses. Fighting and completing quests guarantee the collection of experience points that unlock further growth possibilities for the protagonist and his inventory, while in all this there are also ~rogue-lite~ elements, so to speak, in the possibility of saving progress at each camp and being able to restart from these every time the character dies, with the opportunity to recover the lost materials if you manage to reach his corpse. The survival then emerges with other gameplay features such as the collection of food and ingredients, which can be expanded by unlocking specific tools and additional knowledge, fishing and cooking. The latter also participates in the whole game structure set on the search for resources, but in this case focused on the collection of ingredients useful for completing the recipes that are found around the map. Once the appropriate tools (pots and similar objects) have been built, it is possible to cook various dishes capable of modifying the protagonist's statistics, making him obtain some very useful bonuses and modifiers.", "date": "2022-06-06", "grade": "7.8"}
