{"name": "NieR: Automata Game of the YoRHa Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nier-automata-goty-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Two years have now passed since the release of the last chapter of the Nier series. The cornerstone of the cosmology created by the author Yoko Taro, made up of video games (which also include the three chapters of Drakengard), plays, comics, novels and almost every form of authorial expression present on this planet. After a long period of little global success, also thanks to the low quality with which the former developer Cavia made his own games, the union with Square Enix and Platinum Games was able to give us one of the strongest and most successful experiences of this generation. For the writer, Nier: Automata is even the most important title of this now closing cycle and returning to talk about it now, after two years, can only move something inside, making everything a magical memory. The story of how we wanted to become human From a narrative point of view, Nier: Automata travels in close contact with its playful structure. We are in a distant future in which the human race has now abandoned the earth, totally left to itself and on which only a handful of androids of the resistance resist. Every territory is in decline, for the total use and consumption of those machines that have taken control of it. That small part of humanity still alive has taken refuge in a remote place in the galaxy, away from prying eyes, delegating all the most ignoble tasks to a new category of androids: the YoHRa. Very powerful and advanced anthropomorphic machines, these are managed through an orbiting station from which they depart on a mission to complete their tasks on earth, all in the name of the greatness of that humanity they never knew existed. It is difficult to delve into this relationship without risking ruining a series of twists which, despite what is believed, are revealed at the end of a first run which is only the tip of the iceberg. This is because one of the game's many ingenious inventions lies precisely in its cyclical structure: completing a ~first round~ is not enough to know all the events, but you will be called to replay the title three times. For those unaware of this element, before you close in the throes of boredom generated by this idea, know that, if it is true that the second run retraces in a certain sense what we have already experienced (but from a different , both narrative and gameplay), the third will continue the story until its definitive and tragic conclusion. Over the thirty hours needed to complete the entire journey, you will hardly feel like the same person who started it, and this is the best quality that Nier: Automata brings as a dowry. The prologue, and its intrinsic dose of reflective and philosophical moments, opposed to a gameplay action that mixes white weapons with bullet hell, is enough to understand how we are faced with a communicative and design masterpiece. There is no dialogue, encounter, boss fight or setting that does not reflect an inner growth of the android you are controlling, or an in-depth study of a cosmology that addresses important issues: from the meaning of life, to belonging to a group, passing for the inconsistency of the lie and the tragedy of the betrayal. The advice is to immerse yourself totally in one of the most profound and touching experiences on the world videogame scene. The gameplay and the GOTY edition Let's talk briefly about how Nier: Automata behaves from a purely playful point of view. The game reflects the canons of pure Japanese third-person action, albeit adding to this a series of elements that make it a unique and unrepeatable title. Alongside the clashes in an open world that is actually not very extensive and technically poor, there are a series of design gimmicks that raise it enormously. This is how, seamlessly, from the classic third-person camera through which to fight with your own white weapons (or by exploiting the skills of the pod that we carry with us), we suddenly find ourselves running in a sort of horizontal scrolling title , or even to fight inside a mech in the most amiably retro style possible. The fundamental elements of the gameplay can be found in the dodge (similar in management to that of Bayonetta) and in the insertion of special chips inside the android's equipment slots. These can be of many types and uses: from the one reserved exclusively to see the experience necessary to level up, to those that allow you to extend the duration of the slow motion after a perfect dodge. It is precisely the chips and the possibility of equipping and upgrading different weapons that characterize the RPG componentof Nier: Automata, not particularly deep, but useful to greatly differentiate one android from another. The possibility of spending only a specific number of chip points requires the player to make choices regarding his own specialization, which will come in handy even in the most particular situations. The presence of secondary missions, in sufficient numbers to give a fair longevity to the experience, are also important with a view to deepening some interesting narrative lines, which are unlikely to leave lovers of conspiracies and strong emotions unsatisfied. The GOTY version - Game of the YoHRa - adds a series of small extra additions to the initial package, as well as the now inevitable DLC. The latter does not particularly shine in terms of quality and quantity of content, forgetting the importance of that progression on which Nier lives a little along the way. The fact remains that it represents a discreet addition, in which a finale makes its way if possible even more beautiful than the main arc. Reaching it is not exactly a walk, but we assure you that the effort will repay you. Mobile budget for a questionable technical side From a technical point of view, Nier: Automata lives a double nature, as often happens with low-budget Japanese titles. The settings are bare and not very detailed, the map is very small by today's standards and the artificial intelligence does not make you cry for a miracle. As if that weren't enough, the balance of difficulty is not without flaws, making life difficult in the initial phase (especially if played at one of the last two difficulty levels) and gradually softening, almost eliminating the degree of challenge once you find a right build with chips or taking advantage of the lack of level adaptation for enemies in already visited zones. The boss fights on the contrary, albeit fewer than expected, are satisfying and, in some cases - like the doll - even created following an extraordinary stylistic intuition. This is because the artistic side and the details of the main models represent one of the spearheads of the production, to which are added a soundtrack so exciting that it will never leave your mind and a variety in game situations that are difficult to believe for the genre of membership.", "date": "2019-03-01", "grade": "9.0"}
