We don't need to look too far back since this form of alliance, probably very profitable for both parties, dates back to the launch of Wii, DS and 3DS at the latest; all systems that have highlighted a certain change of attitude in Nintendo, which has materialized with a greater openness towards third parties also thanks to a better cadenced management of the various franchises that have made the Kyoto producer famous. Ubisoft didn't stand idly by with Wii U, proposing a handful of video games for the new console, including conversions and exclusives, once again establishing itself as the publisher with the most titles at the launch of a Nintendo platform. And so alongside the various ZombiU, Your Shape, Sports Connections and beautiful company, Assassin's Creed III also makes a fine show of itself, the mammoth title of the French house that arrives on the market with a very interesting conversion capable, at least on paper, of elevating the hardcore appeal of the new console alongside a Darksiders II already reviewed in recent days. Is there any news? But just compared to the good porting work done by THQ in terms of use of the GamePad, Ubisoft limited itself to carrying out the homework focusing above all on technical optimizations. And not that that's a bad thing, of course. But before focusing on the novelties of this Wii U version and on the conversion work, it is imperative to refer you to our complete and detailed review of the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions made by Antonio Fucito where you will find every single information on the story and the gameplay, in addition to the inevitable graphic disquisition. In purely content terms Assassin's Creed III for the Nintendo console is in all respects identical to the other editions mentioned above. Both in the field of the full-bodied single player, which is presented here unchanged in its length and in the arrangement of the missions as well as in its strongly sandbox nature, and as regards the multiplayer which arrives immediately complete with all the modes already seen elsewhere and with support for the exact same number of players. Finally, the same also applies to future DLCs that will be released, identical, also on Wii U probably simultaneously with the other versions. And finally we come to the use of the GamePad, probably the only sore point of the entire Ubisoft production, obviously when compared with the expectations of those who have just bought the new console and trust in massive use of its main feature. From this point of view, Assassin's Creed III is quite innovative: the map of the game area is constantly shown on the touch screen, including all the various icons enabled in the dedicated menu which can be accessed with the + button. The only exception is represented by cutscenes, during which the screen of the pad reflects exactly what you see on the television. Unfortunately the map cannot be moved to your liking by dragging it with your finger but only and exclusively zoomed in on two levels by double-tapping. Even if the convenience represented by this visual solution is indisputable, given that it allows you to play the title in a much more fluid way having to resort to the pause to open the enlarged map on the TV screen to a much lesser extent, we would have expected enhanced management of the same on the touch screen. In addition, it is always possible to recall Connor's horse by pressing a special button and in fact freeing up a weapon slot which, in the versions for other consoles and PCs, must be occupied by the whistle in case you want to recall the steed. Finally, by activating the paraphernalia selection radial menu, it becomes possible to select the offensive tool or the equipment to be assigned to the quick keys simply through the touch, a bit like on PlayStation Vita with Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. In short, the precise design direction of Ubisoft is evident, which has staked everything on making the gaming experience on Wii U as identical as possible to the other versions, introducing a truly minimal use of the GamePad and exclusively relegated to greater comfort and fluidity of the gameplay . Does this shoot too? We immediately respond with a hesitant no, which however requires some additional explanation. The Wii U conversion of Assassin's Creed III has a frame rate that is certainly lower than that seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but nothing that leads to excessive slowdown phenomena in grado to affect the rendering of the gameplay. This means that all those who have already tried the title on another platform will notice a slower slowness in the frequency of images on the screen, slight but always present. On the other hand, those approaching the game for the first time thanks to the new Nintendo console will simply notice a lack of general fluidity typical of titles that push the console on which they run to the maximum, but which in reality in the case of Assassin's Creed III shows a optimization of the engine still partial, since it is a launch title, therefore developed with only an approximate knowledge of the new hardware. In terms of graphic rendering, carrying on the comparison, we certainly notice a higher quality of the lighting of the environments and more generally a deeper visual horizon. On the other hand, it is more difficult to evaluate the quality of the textures which seemed practically identical to us. Unfortunately, all the bugs that have characterized this episode of the series also remain unchanged: from graphic glitches to problems related to disappearances of characters or interpenetration of models, passing through pop-ups and pop-ins of all kinds; all the samples are present, identical, also on Wii U. For information we can add that a day-one patch is also available for this version and partially manages to limit all these problems while remaining far from eliminating them. Finally Assassin's Creed III can also be played entirely via GamePad, but of course losing the few additional features typical of this version.", "date": "2012-12-02", "grade": "8.9"}
