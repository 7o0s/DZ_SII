So let's see if the game manages to make up for a certain lack of originality with content that is up to the task. The messy astronaut In the best mobile tradition, Beyond Gravity offers a play structure so simple and intuitive that you don't even need a tutorial to understand it. In some ways, the game falls into the category of endless runners, in the sense that the user continues until he makes a mistake that causes game over and the consequent restart from the beginning. Unlike the classics of the genre, however, here the protagonist does not have an autonomous motion that needs to be managed, given that the player's intervention concerns the jumps that our astronaut must make from one planetoid to another in order to continue. Starting from the crash site, we therefore find ourselves jumping between spherical bodies that differ in size, direction of rotation and speed of the same, trying to soar in space with the right timing not only to reach the next planet, but also to collect as much possible number of screws and bolts floating in the void. It is precisely these last elements that make Beyond Gravity stimulating right from the start, given that one is naturally led to try to make jumps with the ideal angle to ring a complete row: this objective is also not reduced to a mere personal challenge, given that stringing perfect series allows you to obtain valuable score multipliers. Collecting these objects is also essential to be able to access some extra contents: in fact, there is a special section where it is possible to use screws and bolts as currency to purchase a series of upgrades for the protagonist, ranging from simple aesthetic changes to real expansions of the his skills. Indeed, everything could have been managed better, given that the items available are not so many and they all require terribly high sums to be unlocked: the real risk is that an average user gets bored with the game well before having obtained even just the items of the list more ~cheap~, and this is the result of an obvious error of judgment in the design. Beyond Gravity is a fun title but one that risks having a rather short life However, this is not the only pat on the hands that we feel like giving the developers of Qwiboo, considering how Beyond Gravity would have enormously benefited from a little more variety in the path it offers to the user. All that needs to be done in the game is reduced to tapping the screen at the desired moment to make the astronaut jump, with the only variations represented by the possibility of producing a double jump (useful for correcting a wrong trajectory) and holding down the finger to momentarily stop the motion of the planet where you are and thus wait for the right moment to soar in flight: an action that is especially useful when fireballs appear in the space between the starting point and the destination, but which in fact constitute the only obstacle that is found during the matches. A little more inventiveness in this sense would have greatly benefited a product that is as much immediate fun as it is potentially tedious in the short term precisely because of the lack of a palpable sense of progression. Beyond Gravity partially compensates for these shortcomings with an undoubtedly captivating price and with a very pleasant technical realization especially from a stylistic point of view: the game is absolutely not a monster of technique, but the cartoonish cut given to the graphics is very pleasant, accompanied by animations and excellent sound effects.", "date": "2014-07-18", "grade": "7.3"}
