{"name": "NHL 2K7 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nhl-2k7-recensione-2.html", "text": "Hat Trick Performing a ~Hat Trick~ in hockey terms means accomplishing the feat of scoring three goals in a game, a feat that is punctually greeted by throwing hats from the stands as a sign of respect for the player. NHL 2K7 is a Hat Trick hockey video game, capable of providing players with three modes of absolute videogame value. The first of these is the one that actually represents the tutorial of the game: the importance of this mode does not lie in its actual presence (a tutorial for a video game is quite common) but in the possibility offered to dissect all the points in complete tranquility game key. One chapter is dedicated to understanding the pressure mode, whereby by carrying out an attack you will be able to command your teammates to press your opponents so as to have a player free from marking and therefore free to go to the net; control of the area instead explores the first real novelty of this PS3 version, the evolution of first-person control of the goalkeeper allows you to move the Sixaxis in such a way as to cover the goal and thus block the opponent's attack; the coach tutorial allows players to learn to experience matches from a different point of view, not getting into the game but limiting themselves to making the right choices at the right moment. The hockey understanding experience is completed by the instructions for the new Pro controls to be used during matches, in perfecting one's skating techniques and finally in preparing for the shoot-out, the hockey penalties in which a player starting from midfield he challenges the goalkeeper in a one-on-one attempt to score the winning goal. The second part of the Hat Trick is certainly also the most varied and important, capable of grouping career, season, tournament, mini playing field and pond under a single wing. If for the first three there is no need for particular explanations (they represent the classic season and the playoffs complete with team rosters, players' market and all the rest), the mini playing field and the pond certainly arouse curiosity at a first glance of the menu: the first allows the player to take part in 3vs3 challenges (the goalkeeper plus two other players) that are decidedly more frenetic, more arcadey, less tactical and without fail within smaller playing fields, while the second leads the teams to challenge each other 4vs4 on the classic frozen lake behind the house, away from the limelight. The third and final cornerstone is represented by the online mode, never so solid and full-bodied in a game dedicated to hockey, with the possibility of taking part in single games, as well as participating in real online leagues with players from all over the world. world. The convenience of being online in a sports game is also evident in the possibility of downloading Rooster updates (team roses) and being included in a large online ranking complete with statistics, streaks and all the rest. Hit the ice Although the amount of material of excellent quantity has already been highlighted, NHL 2K7 seems to be a running train that absolutely does not want to be stopped, and for all those who could find the experience deriving from the modalities described above not very long-lived, the Kush Games (the developers of the game) have seen fit to re-insert and expand the party mode already present in previous appearances of the game. Party games can be considered as the real fulcrum of multiplayer challenges without too many pretensions: you can take part in particular mini-games based in all respects on hockey against 3 other opponents (human or controlled by the CPU) in free-for-all battles or in teams; the mini-games have rules specially designed for each one and range from puck hunting (the black puck with which hockey is played) inside crates, through target shooting, to ending up with real shoulder battles . There are about a dozen mini-games to select, with the possibility for each player to create a sort of playlist of favorites or simply to indicate how many mini-games to face and leave the random choice of these to the CPU. On the modality side, the now indispensable Skybox closes the circle, the operations center of one's player profile, the office which contains all the results achieved in one's career as a hockey player, the trophies, the films and the three classics entertainment games: a magnetic hockey, a curling board and a cabinet containing a trivia game dedicated exclusively to the history of this splendid sport. NHL 2K7 returns to PS3 owners enrichedhit of the experience offered by SIXAXIS Hit the ice NHL 2K7 returns to PS3 owners enriched by the experience offered by SIXAXIS, in addition to the already mentioned possibility of taking total control of the goalkeeper (perhaps still a bit slow and cumbersome, but with enormous development potential), the new pad of the Sony console provides the most involved players with the opportunity to experience game contact first-hand: as in all other editions of the game, shoulder contact is performed with the circle button, parallel to this - thanks to the sensor of the pad - giving a strong shake it is possible to perform the same move, an interesting innovation and which if at first may seem rather useless in the long run gives the gaming experience (especially if in the multiplayer phase) a very special touch. The rest of the controls now appear absolutely optimized for the purpose of the game, easy to understand and use and easy to adapt to the various game settings. Graphically, the game does not differ much from the Xbox 360 version, but it is surprising above all as regards the creation of the ice with a lot of effects of reflections and persistent trails of the skates. The models of the players are not close to perfection but still manage to give a good characterization, which unfortunately cannot be said of the models of the fans along the edge of the stadium, far too simplistic and repetitive. The whole sound sector remains at high levels, thanks to the always excellent contribution of the two reporters and a soundtrack created for the occasion that draws heavily from the sub-pop world, with groups and songs that are decidedly little known in the old continent but which they blend well with everything. Special mention for the so-called Cinemotion, a way of using the audio for which each player can decide whether to play with the classic background news or relying completely on the game's soundtrack to accompany their skates. NHL 2K7 extends the positive streak of 2K home hockey with a solid, long-lived product, absolutely varied and suitable for many game experiences. The willingness of the developers to experiment in forecasts of future additions is evident, just look at the new features to be exploited through Sixaxis and Cinemotion. On balance perhaps one of the few weaknesses is represented by a lack of PS3 hardware, in the absence of any rumble function (or vibration, call it what you like). We just have to wait for 2008 and see what the videogame hockey world has in store for us. Pros: Dozens of modes to take part in. Probably the closest game to real hockey. The movements and animations of the players are excellently done. Cons: Not a huge step up from the already great 2K6 edition. Menu interface largely revised. With the Stanley Cup Finals currently underway between the Anaheim Mighy Ducks and the Ottawa Senators, there is probably no better time for 2K Sports to release its PS3 hockey port. The current generation of consoles has brought a new breath of realism to what was already believed to be unsurpassedly beautiful and truthful. One of the genres that have benefited the most from evolutions in terms of graphics is certainly the sports one, which has always been devoted to the perfect creation of models similar in all respects to their real counterparts. Hockey is a fast sport - perhaps one of the fastest and most frenetic in the world - and for this reason it is very difficult to follow if you are not at least minimally accustomed to the strategies and movements of the players. And this is where 2K comes in, to teach us the basics of this wonderful sport", "date": "2007-05-28", "grade": null}
