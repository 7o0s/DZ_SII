For those unfamiliar with it, but it seems impossible, it is a strategic game in which you have to carry out exclusively (or almost) the defensive part, trying to stem the wave attacks of the enemies through the dislocation of units and structures in capable of curbing its inexorable march. The concept is simple but finds perfect application on mobile platforms, thanks to a perfect integration with the tactile control system that can be performed with short touches using only one hand, the fast rhythms marked by short and fragmented matches and the classic progression mechanism constant in terms of experience level and earned bonuses that capture the player, even the occasional one, in its coils. As a perfect paradigm of the entire genre, Castle Creeps TD sums up all these characteristics, revealing itself as a well-composed tower defense, equipped with a balanced balance, an excellent control system and a good variety of enemies and variations to conquer in regards to structures and unities, but precisely this extreme canonicity of his represents his greatest weakness. The amalgam of its elements is all too perfect, carefully studied so as not to offer innovative impulses precisely so as not to disturb the balance achieved thanks to a precise application of the basic construction rules of tower defense, which is so well structured but also devoid of one's own genuine soul. This is rather bizarre also because another title of this genre has previously arrived from the same, namely Alien Creeps TD, with which this shares many stylistic and structural solutions but which, unlike Castle Creeps, exploited at least one rather particular characterization. Castle Creeps is a tower defense precisely structured according to the best rules, even too much The Orc Invasions Strictly following the perfect tower defense manual, Castle Creeps TD puts us to grips with waves of invading orcs intent on conquering the various single-screen maps that make up the game. To stop the orcs, the player can obviously resort to the use of towers, which represent the primary defensive system but not the only one, having characteristics that place them as perfect systems for getting rid of some types of enemies but also bringing along some weak points which make them less effective on others. For this reason it is necessary to dynamically adapt defense strategies based on how the enemy attack is taking place, using infantry to create checkpoints and slowdowns while trying to use the right types of weapons in the best areas of the map . There are towers that shoot, that strike in various ways and those that deal with the creation and training of new members of the infantry, all together with the presence of the Hero, the particular fighter capable of using special moves and acting in a decidedly reactive way on the mass. In this regard, there is excellent behavior on the part of the units, which appear to be managed by good artificial intelligence and supported by a decidedly satisfactory control system. Taking down enemies and progressing through levels involves collecting elixir, which represents the main resource in the game world, being able to be invested in building new structures and units, or improving existing ones. From an aesthetic point of view, Castle Creeps TD is characterized by a very clean graphic design, which presents classic fantasy elements filtered through a cartoonish perspective, also seen several times in numerous similar productions to tell the truth. Compared to Alien Creeps TD, this new title seems to have corrected the excessive evidence of the paywall that emerged after a few hours of play, softening the free-to-play structure with less insistent requests towards microtransactions and allowing a more gradual and free approach between complete gratuity and unbridled shopping.", "date": "2017-01-12", "grade": "8.0"}
