{"name": "Marvel Vs Capcom 2: New Age Of Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes.html", "text": "Gameplay Marvel Vs Capcom 2 is the summa of the ~versus~ series, thanks to the presence of 56 selectable characters (even if 30 of these must be unlocked by playing repeatedly and accumulating credits, also useful for buying some artworks, absent in the original version), the possibility of create an almost enormous number of combos or teams, since now it will be possible to select the beauty of 3 characters per team; as in the prequels, the 2 teammates ~on the bench~ can be called upon to carry out an offensive or defensive action (choice among 3 available, in the selection screen), to relieve the by now exhausted fighter (and give him the opportunity to recover part of his energy) or unleash a mega attack with one or both partners, capable of shearing huge portions of the unfortunate opponent's life bar. For the rest, we are facing a classic one-on-one fighting game, the team loses without any fighters to send onto the field (or whoever has less of them, at the end of the playing time), there are super jumps, counterattacks and so many special moves to assimilate. Most of the characters available (immediately or not) come from past episodes and other well-known videogame sagas (Ryu, Ken, Chun Li, Zangief from Street Fighter, Anakaris from Darkstalkers, Strider from the beautiful arcade of the same name, Jill Valentine from none other than Bio Hazard/ Resident Evil and so on), just as Spiderman, Captain America, Hulk, Blackheart, Magneto, Dr Doom return to beat up, together with the new entries included in the video game package: we point out, among others, the pirate Ruby Heart, the cactus (? Ed) Amingo, Cable (with high firepower) and the new super boss Abyss, to be killed in three stages. Unlike more complex sagas such as (for example) Street Fighter Zero/Alpha or Darkstalker, the gameplay there is more geared towards raw tinkering than towards technical combat: chain combos and fast counters cling to desperation moves that are very simple to perform (half-moon and simultaneous pressure of the 2 punches or kicks, even the sole pressure of only 2 keys devoted to use in game by partners to perform multiple super combos), thanks to a simplified gameplay, thanks to the omission of the keys used for medium power punch and kick (4 are now the attack buttons, instead of the canonical 6 of CAPtive COMmunication fighting games). Lovers of more complex games such as the aforementioned Street Fighter Zero (or The King Of Fighters and Samurai Spirits, of the historical rival Snk) could easily get bored by the non-existent technical vein of this second episode of Marvel Vs Capcom, all the others (in first of all the fans of the prequel and of the other crossovers, as well as those who have spent money in the arcade) come forward. From Dreamcast to Playstation 2 Just 2 years ago, the undersigned found himself discussing among friends whether Playstation 2, unlike the albeit talented Psone, had been able to manage the two-dimensional graphic tussle moved by coin ops (and related conversions on Dreamcast) of the caliber of Marvel Vs Capcom 2 and Guilty Gear X, with no obvious afflictions; well, at the price of a couple of seconds of loading more than the conversion for the mistreated 128 bit Sega and a lower definition for the sprites only, the conversion is perfectly successful: the beautiful backdrops (full of mutable and moving elements) , such as the one set in the polo, the circus stage or, again, the level equipped with the clock with the same time shown inside the Playstation 2, have been converted verbatim while the sprites (although poorly defined compared to the original) are all in all still acceptable, although some of these have been recycled from now outdated episodes (in some cases, even with half a decade on the back). Luckily the animations are still quite fluid, there are no slowdowns (demonstrating the excellent potential of the 128 bit Sony in two-dimensional field), even when on the screen there are sprites that fight, others that temporarily break in (undead, crows and Jill's zombie dogs taken from Resident Evil, Captain Commando's unforgettable friends, supportive teammates, etc), while devastating fireballs alternate with lethal punch and kick combos, in a riot of well-implemented graphic effects . Last happy note for the graphics, or rather for the respectful local adaptation: no unsightly bars and no general slowdown in the game action thanks to the never too praised 50/60hz selector. Generally the sound sector in a fighting game does not split specialized critics and gamers into two factions, but the beautiful msounds, very jazz style (some, among other things, sung), have not been well accepted by the gaming community (the pieces are, however, decidedly catchy), although the undersigned feels like rewarding this attempt by Capcom to have wanted to give a break with the traditional bgm ~beat hit~. The speech is roughly similar to what has already been heard in previous Capcom products, while some sound effects are strangely metallic (eg: punch on the jaw), even when they shouldn't be. Bottom line Marvel Vs Capcom 2: New Age Of Heroes is a very successful conversion from the coin-op from which it is taken, although one cannot but turn up one's nose at the lesser definition of the sprites (especially in the light of Guilty Gear XX, which offers a excellent graphic to say the least ndTanzen), already decidedly antiquated and recycled by now until exhaustion and due to the lack of online mode, also present in the Japanese version of the game; do not worry those who know this version and know that some characters can only be unlocked through repeated gameplay on the net, as they are also accessible, in this pal version, with the usual single player mode. For the rest, the considerations already expressed in the review apply: exceptional soundtrack but not attractive to anyone, fast and furious gameplay as well as very immediate but capable of alienating fans of more reasoned and less instinctive game mechanics. A recommended purchase, therefore, for those who can't live without two-dimensional fighting games and for those who have loved the coin-op or the Dreamcast version madly, as well as for the fanatics of the prequels, everyone else should at least give it a look. Pros: Lots of selectable characters, a huge number of moves to learn Suggestive backdrops, particularly cool music Cons: At least antiquated sprites Too instinctive and not very technical for some Ryu vs. Captain America, fourth episode Not happy with having launched the fashion of 2D fighting games for meetings (starting with the Street Fighter saga, in 1986), continuing with Darkstalkers and Cyberbots (and countless updates, sometimes a useless mouse ed), Capcom was one of the few software houses to create video game ties, worthy of the video game reputation, for all the immortal Marvel heroes such as Hulk, Spiderman, Captain America, Magneto and beautiful company; from X-men: Children Of The Atom and continuing with Marvel Super Heroes, CAPtive COMmunication has repeatedly demonstrated its mastery of the art of creating exceptional one-on-one beatem'ups, while also adding now standard features such as super jumps, super moves with a devastation coefficient set to frightening levels and, above all, creating a whole series of crossovers between his street fighters (human and otherwise) and Marvel heroes (and relative nemeses). The result was X-men Vs Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes Vs Street Fighter, culminating with the bilogy of Marvel Vs Capcom, which takes all those factors seen and loved from Children Of The Atom onwards to excess. Marvel Vs Capcom 2: New Age Of Heroes is the latest title released by the renowned Japanese software house concerning these crossovers with the Marvel note. The title is also very well known having seen its birth a couple of years ago in the arcade (motherboard Naomi) and later on Sega Dreamcast (incidentally, with that review the writer had access to these pages ed). Let's see how Playstation 2 has welcomed this frenetic fighting game, whose only fault is, perhaps, that it came out too late, although in a period that is really stingy with releases of this kind", "date": "2003-01-24", "grade": null}
