{"name": "Warp Drive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warp-drive-la-recensione.html", "text": "There is always a notable desire for futuristic racing, as demonstrated by the numerous productions in this genre that we have seen resurgence in the last period, but not many are available on mobile platforms, for this reason we look at Warp's review with some interest Drive on iOS. The game is available in the Apple Arcade catalog and this already represents a first indication of the quality of the title, because beyond the selection made by Apple's subscription service, which has recently returned to work at excellent levels, it also means that there are microtransactions, or at least disturbing machinations in favor of them. In fact, Warp Drive is a pure and simple futuristic racer that quite faithfully follows the typical canon of the sub-genre in question, with the defects and merits that this classicist setting brings with it. Among the former we can mention a certain lack of originality and bite in the long run, among the latter there is the usual immediate and immediately engaging gameplay, here further made available to everyone by a somewhat simplified guide system. One often wonders what happened to arcade racing, well it is clear that the genre has now found shelter on the shores of indie development, once the support of large publishers with important productions has disappeared, with the exception of some rare contrary examples (such as Forza Horizon and Mario Kart). In particular, it seems that the independent developers have taken this type of racing particularly to heart, that is the futuristic racing game all based on crazy speed, flights and the use of power-ups: in essence, it is clear that many want try to fill the gap left by the disappearance of series like Wipeout and F-Zero. Warp Drive fits into this vein, without adding practically anything new but still proposing an interesting interpretation for setting and track design, moreover derived from a further digression of this kind that we have also seen in GRIP. As in the Caged Element game, also in this case it is often a question of jumping between various tracks arranged on different floors, which run in parallel and intersect, creating further frenzy of action but also a slightly deeper approach to finding the paths faster. Warp Speed! There is a certain simplification in the mechanics, which is also reflected in the controls: in this sense Warp Drive is far from the refinement of the driving technique of Wipeout, but also from the more complex approaches that we have seen recently in RedOut, offering a much more basic and direct. The shuttle runs in an elevated manner but we can only control its acceleration and steering, with the possibility of applying the classic drifting to better adjust the trajectories, while the only power-up is given by momentary accelerations which are acquired by hitting the crystals arranged on the track. In general, the tracks are well assorted but not very complex to tackle, often with wide carriageways and plenty of room to recover from mistakes, at least for a long first part of the game. The most characterizing element in all of this is given by the warp system, i.e. a key that is activated only at certain times and allows you to jump the shuttle from one surface to another on the track or making it collide against opponents to send them off the track , taking advantage of specific ~hooks~ with the right timing. It is a system similar to that seen in GRIP, but in this case it can only be carried out in the precise points that allow this movement, another element that can represent a certain simplification to the structure. The fact of being able to run on different surfaces introduces some interesting variations to the action, also because the design of the tracks is structured in such a way as to make these passages particularly spectacular and also the choice whether to carry them out or not is a bit strategic: in this various alternative routes that have different characteristics and can represent real shortcuts (often more complicated to take and travel), escape routes to get out of complicated duels or different systems for overtaking. However, the game tends to reward the use of these alternative paths and the fact that to undertake them it is sufficient to press a key at the right time simplifies everything a bit with correct timing in activating the command. On iOS, the use of a controller is highly recommended, because the virtual pad system on the touch screen really loses a lot to the driving model, not having analog controls. The only game mode is the Tournament, which offers a long sequence of various events withdifferent types of racing, from the grand prix to the one-on-one challenge to the time trial and other variations in a constant progression from level to level. Performance in the race determines the conquest of credits that can be spent to purchase new vehicles and upgrades, with objects that are offered randomly and for limited periods of time. This system is also very simple and is basically based on adding and replacing pre-set modular elements, but it still adds something to the core gameplay and gives a good sense of progression from game to game. The graphic style adopted, somewhat cartoonish, allows you to obtain excellent performance even on not exactly very recent devices, giving priority to the fluidity of the action and to speed. On the other hand, the use of 3D tending towards cel-shading with a particular color saturation perfectly conveys the idea of strange landscapes and alien worlds, giving a strong characterization to the scenarios. A special mention must be made for the audio accompaniment, which offers a truly appreciable and distinctive and rather original funky soundtrack for the genre.", "date": "2020-12-04", "grade": "7.5"}
