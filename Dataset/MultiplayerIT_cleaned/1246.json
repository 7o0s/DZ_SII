{"name": "Gangland - Vita da mafioso", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gangland-vita-da-mafioso.html", "text": "Mafia life The story is one that we can read on the poster of any b-movie about the mafia and does not present particular creative upheavals. Sicily: the three Mangano brothers, Romano, Angelo and Sonny, betray their family, kill their fourth brother, Chico, and flee overseas. Obviously, the matter cannot go unpunished and wounded honor cries out to be avenged. In the role of Mario Mangano, the fifth brother, we arrive in the States under the employ of the boss Vincenzo, his uncle among other things, and we will begin our ascent to the top of the clan, in order to finally be able to settle the blood debt we carry with us from Sicily. The game is presented with an isometric view, but rotatable and with a good level of magnification, and uses a fairly standard point-and-click interface. From the first moment we can see the care with which the neighborhood is made and the number of people who ~inhabit~ it. The impact is unsettling, in some moments it seems more like an ~episode~ of The Sims than a mafia game, but then you just need to go beyond the first few minutes to dispel any doubts. We will be able to bring with us all kinds of goons, scum and organized crime that we can recruit. Mafia life We have already said that we will play the good Mario (not the plumber!) but we have not said that we will be able to bring with us all kinds of henchmen, scum and organized crime that we can recruit. But be careful: it is not a strategic one, so forget about armies of units to unleash on the map, our allies will always be limited in number and, at least at the beginning, we will only be able to take a few with us at a time. But what beautiful people! Gangland is structured in successive missions and the freedom granted to the player increases as the game situations progress. From the beginning we will be given the right to extort money from shopkeepers and recruit companions, but better not to spend boss Vincenzo's money too much, otherwise we might not like his reaction. The management phase consists in gradually taking possession of the activities around the boss's refuge and receiving the income, with the money we will then be able to expand the turnover and fortify the neighborhood. As we progress, we will gain more power, until we become little bosses ourselves. Once we can sit behind our nice desk, we will be able to issue orders, commission murders, pay bribes and even find a woman, get married and have children. Children are not a useless frill, as once they grow up they will become important units to be deployed in the fight against the other clans and will be our lieutenants, with the power to give orders in our absence. So, all around us we will have gathered a heterogeneous gang made up of petty cutthroats, robbers and ugly thugs, but also special units such as snipers, matrons, seductresses, infiltrators and even ninjas! Even before being businessmen (as well as men of honor) you are ruthless killers! But what beautiful people! Together with the management phase, however, the more trivial one of the fights is intertwined, during which, in fact, we will have to collide with other criminals, law enforcement agencies and we will even have to commit murders, so don't think you keep your butts limply glued to the chair of the office all the time, because even before being businessmen (as well as men of honor) you are ruthless killers! During our raids, we will be able to use vehicles and, in the most classic gangster-style, shoot from the windows, as we once saw in the cinema. A driving license is enough to drive a car, but a thief is needed to open it, so until we have recruited one we will be able to afford the luxury of four wheels only when Uncle Vincenzo wants to grant it to us. The cars that we will be able to drive are enough to create quite a lot of lustful interest, but they are not many. There are sports and utility cars, sedans and military vehicles, as well as trucks and police cars. Sadly though, the help section is lacking in all respects. First of all, it is not possible to leave the roadway by car, so if you want to do a little slalom among pedestrians on the sidewalk or if you want to run around among the tables of some bars you will be very disappointed, furthermore the collision routines are unable to distinguish between a trash can and a lamppost, between the curb and the corner of another car, so you'll crash into both a concrete post and a light trash can with equal crash. Seeing from the images, it would seem that we are dealing with a good GTA clone, but that is not the case. Furthermore, the roads are too narrow and we often find ourselves stuck in curves. In short, from this point of view it is oneburning disappointment. Let's take a closer look at the gameplay of Gangland. The units available differ in characteristics, ranging from hit points to accuracy, and in the typical skills of each. The matron can treat the wounded and behind her peaceful air she hides a violent killer nature, with her deadly shotgun, however she is damned slow, as we can see from her tonnage, she rattles off banal phrases in Italian and makes excellent meatballs (see back of the manual). The sniper, as we can well imagine, is an excellent long-range shooter, but has a very slow reload time, so it should be used with great caution. And then we find lawyers, capable of bribing people, street girls, capable of immobilizing any enemy with their pepper spray, ninjas, businessmen, infiltrators, bouncers and thieves. A nice bunch, no doubt about it. What emerges, examining the various units, is that the differentiation is sometimes a little too drastic and badly balanced. For example, the girl with the pepper spray can immobilize anyone and, once she has caught her victim, this absolutely cannot react, at least until someone eliminates the girl. This fact transforms a banal little girl into a deadly war machine, in the face of the most important ninjas, bombers and anything else that comes from the special units. An interesting addition is the possibility of making the characters of the game gain experience, making them improve their characteristic skills. Don't think you're dealing with an RPG, however, here it is simply a bar that fills up as we kill enemies and complete objectives, nothing else. There are no points to distribute nor stats to increase, when a unit changes level we are simply notified and the only difference is that that unit has become stronger. The pizza dough. Now we come to the technical aspect of the game. The isometric view, the ability to rotate and zoom, the people on the streets and the shops with their microscopic daily life, are details that give a certain pleasure to the more properly visual aspect of this title, but the skeleton on which Gangland grew up it is a three dimensional skeleton which sadly shows a few flaws here and there. In Gangland there are no particularly spectacular effects, the textures are rather washed out and if you think that the concrete has its roughness and the bodywork of the cars shines shiny in the sun, you are wrong, because there is no bump mapping shadow or other now fundamental effects . It's all very three-dimensionally flat. Fortunately, at least, the details of which the city is rich come to meet us, ranging from the architecture of the buildings, often cared for to the point of appearing as real reconstructions, to the models and animations of the people. But this is not enough to improve the graphic quality. Furthermore, during the most agitated phases of the game, controlling the characters becomes quite difficult and more than once we will find ourselves clicking on a unit to see another selected. Furthermore, giving orders when the battle gets crowded is similarly annoying, since pointing the mouse at a crowding of units does not make selecting them easy. Fortunately, at least, that through the active pause we can interrupt the action to command the individual units, unfortunately, however, only one order can be given at a time, because command queues are not supported. But better than nothing, right? It's all very three-dimensionally flat. The pizza dough. To make up for the graphic quality and the inaccuracies of the control system, at least, there is a well-packed audio with nice music and good effects. The only sore point are the sentences in Italian. But did they really have to put them on? Comment Gangland is, in fact, a fun game, not a masterpiece, and it has its flaws, especially in the driving section, which in my opinion shouldn't have been included at all. Gangland mixes the cards of many different decks and the result is not unpleasant, indeed at the beginning you are pleasantly surprised, then slowly you begin to have a broader vision and the initial enthusiasm is reduced. This does not mean that ultimately it is a title capable of involving and entertaining, even if not in an optimal way. If you are looking for a good substitute for Mafia or a pleasant diversion from GTA, then you will be disappointed, but if you are looking for a fun title capable of keeping you in front of the screen for a few hours, then Gangland is for you, the important thing is to postpone in front of a bad driving section and a graphic that shows a few years on the rump. The fights are fun and well done, maybe whatwhat an extra option and a slightly more refined balance wouldn't have hurt, but all in all it's fun even like this and then the possibility of mixing action phases with planning and management phases makes the approach to gameplay much deeper and this is a great plus point. I mean, ultimately, how is this Gangland? But a good middle ground, of course. It's a bit crude, they could have spent more time to smooth out some rough edges, it has dated graphics and it's not very original, but it's fun. And it doesn't cost much either. What more do you want? The vote? There he is... Once upon a time in Italy... Once upon a time there was a town where the inhabitants ate only pasta, had fat mothers with flowery dresses and where a crowbar was used to open a business. In that happy town the men were all mafiosi and the women all matrons and, especially in the evening, when everyone had gathered around the domestic hearth and grandfather Angelo was telling the stories of his childhood, a plate of ravioli was never missing...In the plot of Gangland, the new title of the little-known Mediamobsters, fits into a very cloying frame, where the Belpaese described above really comes to life among the digital folds of this game. The plot, in itself, is not bad, re-proposing the usual theme of mafia brothers who betray the family and the bloody revenge that follows; what is really sad is the fat amount of clichs about Italians, which overflows from every byte. Obviously, the mobsters are Italian, the first scenario where we find ourselves playing is called Little Italy and is literally overflowing with flags and tricolor flags (it doesn't matter if we find ourselves in an imaginary city with the very American name of Paradise City) and - with equally obvious - Italians only eat ravioli and meatballs. If you haven't passed out yet, then carry on with a lighter heart, as things will improve later on.", "date": "2004-07-20", "grade": null}
