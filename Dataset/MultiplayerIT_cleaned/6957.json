As punctual as the bathroom after a coffee and a cigarette, the official game of the Ninja Turtles arrives on our devices, inspired by the film to be released in Italian cinemas in September. Since these are sensitive topics, we immediately give you the first bad news, perhaps the worst of all: the protagonists are not the old classic turtles, but the super pumped up (and super nasty) version of Jonathan Liebesman's 2014 film. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a surprisingly very fun game. promoted! It's not your usual pizza The game mechanics are nothing revolutionary, but they guarantee a healthy dose of fun. Basically it's about fighting with our Turtle against a horde of enemies: you don't directly control the character, rather you have to decide which opponents to attack and which move to use, all via a tap and a swipe. Each level, and there are 35 of them, is accompanied by a small comic strip that summarizes the story and occasionally introduces the main bosses; the plot, although not very well articulated, is quite sufficient to quench your thirst for martial arts and pizza. Each battle won sees the distribution of gems and money as a reward, useful for enhancing a hero to the maximum, but not enough to level each turtle: it's up to the player to decide who to entrust their care and the money collected. The controls, as mentioned above, are intuitive and allow you to perform complex actions and combos simply with a finger and fast reflexes. In all, you have 5 moves per round available and as you progress you learn new skills that will help you survive in the final rounds, decidedly tougher than the first ones: Nickelodeon has done a good job with regard to this aspect, given that the mechanics they're easy to understand, don't take too long to learn, and are refined enough to be enjoyed by a wide audience. The only drawback concerns the special combos: by performing a certain number of moves, a bar is filled that allows you to activate a devastating blow, but only on condition that you complete a quick-time for each turtle. For Leonardo, a series of swipes must be made which are not always accepted, with the risk of having to interrupt the combo. Graphically the game uses a nice cel shading, giving a typical comic feel; unfortunately, as mentioned, the characters are not the classic ones, but rather the new ones of 2014, which could disappoint many fans. Sore point the animations, which not only are quite cumbersome and imperfect, but in the most agitated phases of the battles they even manage to snap. On the in-app purchases front, we point out that although these are present, earning the gems and money needed to upgrade the character is a fairly easy operation, which makes in-app purchases superfluous. The game does not include any multiplayer element, which is not necessarily a bad thing, given the very nature of the gameplay: to partially compensate for this lack, the developers have included a horde mode in which you pass as many levels as possible with a single life.", "date": "2014-08-20", "grade": "8.0"}
