{"name": "Rytmos", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rytmos-recensione.html", "text": "The puzzle game genre is so broad and varied that it now includes many different types of experiences: from the more frenetic and demanding ones to those imagined for relaxing enjoyment, perhaps embraced by an essential but precious sound design, which frames fresh and original. This is precisely the case of the new title developed by Floppy Club, already available on PC and Nintendo Switch, but landed on iOS with the awareness that mobile is its true dimension: the intuitive touch controls, the fluidity of the sequences, the graphic style that lends itself perfectly to vertical viewing: we talk about it in the Rytmos review. Structure and gameplay Rytmos, a level with ice blocks as a sidewalk As mentioned at the beginning, Rytmos aims to give us a captivating and relaxing puzzle experience at the same time, linked to the world of music and the most bizarre instruments to create it, which it is no coincidence that we will be able to unlock with each completed puzzle and maybe play a little while we record our performances inside a virtual vinyl to keep. The format conceived by the developers for the mobile version is a demoware that allows you to face the first three puzzles of a campaign that in its entirety includes twenty-one, so to understand if it's really the game for us before eventually proceeding to unlock the complete package for a frankly modest amount, just  5.99. Few coins compared to the pleasure of such an elegant and inspired design, which perhaps stumbles a bit on the touch controls when it comes to moving the cursor, which we will have the task of tracing on the surface in an attempt to embrace all the ~tubes ~ present without ever retracing our steps and crossing the flow, which as we all know is bad. Inevitably, what we see as we access the ~planets~ that make up the Rytmos campaign is an exercise in progression: we start by simply connecting the dots, but mechanisms and obstacles soon find their place on the playing field to be manipulated in a sometimes imaginative way , sometimes prompt and reactive, in order to conclude the path as established. Rytmos, mobile elements within the scenario also impose a certain speed It is possible to complete the puzzles even partially, by touching only some of the ~pipes~ that we are asked to connect, but it is clear that this is only a moment of uncertainty, a pause for reflection: we will return to the puzzle within few minutes with a solution, also because otherwise we will not be able to unlock the tool assigned to that specific world. In the meantime, things will get more curious and complex, with the scenarios that open up to the three dimensions also in terms of mechanics and the cursor that it must be sent up and down the screen, drawing possible trajectories until you find the right one, join the threads, strum something and smile heartily: mission accomplished. Technical realization Rytmos, one of the levels that span multiple dimensions Rytmos' graphics go hand in hand with the original style of this experience, and look like something out of a design catalog. What appears to us from time to time is an astral body that we can rotate freely and which gradually takes shape, welcoming us inside small, elegant dioramas embellished with captivating chromatic choices. close-up inside the game, even in its essentiality: a few, simple sounds accompany our sensory journey, rewarded as mentioned by the unlocking of bizarre instruments with which to experiment with a melody before putting away the vinyl and moving on to the next puzzle.", "date": "2023-05-30", "grade": "8.0"}
