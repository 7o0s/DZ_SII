{"name": "Smackdown vs Raw 2009", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009-recensione_a.html", "text": "The appointment with Smackdown vs Raw, inevitable for wrestling fans, is renewed punctually like every year; and once again on PSP we will be able to enjoy a conversion that reproduces the spectacular action seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in a more or less faithful way. The developers of the Yuke's team have treasured past experiences, trying to solve the problems that afflicted the last edition of this portable reduction, in this case some AI defects and a technical realization not always up to the situation. More importantly, PSP owners will enjoy all the modes available on the ~major~ consoles (with the exception of online multiplayer), including the brand new story mode and editor to create characters, movesets, entries and finishers. The long road to WrestleMania The first and biggest novelty of Smackdown vs Raw 2009, as mentioned, is represented by the main game mode, ~Road to Wrestlemania~: we will have to choose our character from Triple H, Undertaker, Chris Jericho, John Cena, CM Punk or the couple formed by Batista and Rey Mysterio, then face the three months preceding Wrestlemania between weekly shows and pay-per-views. The story will be different from time to time: in the case of Undertaker, for example, we will have to deal with the stable formed by Santino Marella, Finley and their mysterious principal; as Chris Jericho, on the other hand, we will chase the WWE Title despite the interference of a bizarre man with a balaclava, who we will have to unmask and defeat after having done the necessary ~investigations~. Everything is presented to us exactly as if it were the real WWE broadcasts, with backstage discussions, the intervention of the executives and the meetings: from this point of view, the work of the developers is exceptional for fidelity and passion. Certainly things are made simpler by a gigantic sound sector as far as speech is concerned, with the various superstars and official commentators (the latter updated last year) who have lent themselves, with the professionalism that distinguishes them, to record numerous jokes. In short, the sensation of being in front of the TV is truly amazing! Outline mode In addition to the new story mode, we will be able to try our hand at the classic ~career~ and ~tournament~ modes, both of great substance: in the first case, we will have to choose our fighter among the over sixty available and defeat anyone who stands between us and the world title ; in the second case, we will have the opportunity to participate in the prestigious ~King of the Ring~ or in the ~Beat the Clock Competition~, or events with elimination matches for the conquest of an important recognition. It is clear that the classic exhibition mode will not be missing, in which we will be able to organize any type of meeting and set it in one of the numerous locations present. The multiplayer is only available locally, unfortunately, but boasts a good number of possibilities (even the two-player story mode with Batista and Rey Mysterio), while the customization options have been further enhanced compared to last year: you can manage the rosters and wrestlers in any way (thus modifying them to be identical to the current WWE), create new characters using a powerful editor, equip them with an original moveset and even build an entrance and a finisher for them. In short, there is something for all tastes and the most demanding enthusiasts can really indulge themselves. Question of gameplay If Smackdown vs Raw 2008 suffered from some shortcomings of the AI, this year things have definitely changed: our opponents won't insist with holds while we're on the ground, so the action won't be excessively fragmented and will be more fluid and engaging . For a problem that is solved, however, there is another that comes to the surface: the difficulty of the matches is generally low, i.e. we will be able to dominate the match and make any move without problems and without an opposition worthy of the name . To see things change, you will necessarily have to move to a more demanding level, but in that case we could see a reverse situation, with the opponent who will be able to respond to any of our offensives. The control system hasn't changed, so we'll move our wrestler using the d-pad, with the analog stick being called into question during the more elaborate moves, to warm up the audience or to free himself from submission holds. Let's say that the good or bad feeling hasn't changed, the fights aren't very ~dynamic~ but the variations on the theme are really many (including the new ~hot swap~ system for couple matches). Of course, in terms of deThe gameplay might be time to change things a bit, but this is a matter of the series in general, not just the PSP reduction. Technical realization Compared to last year's edition, the game comes with slightly better graphics. Firstly, the polygonal models of the characters are a little more sophisticated, less angular, without prejudice to a certain woodiness of the animations which, however, has been a trademark of the THQ product for years. The audience has been improved, but not much: the first rows are made up of people made in a discreet way, where previously there were only faceless monsters, but the shots from above (very little guess...) show the spectators like figurines all the same, even colored in the same way, which move in unison according to extremely simple patterns. It's a shame that again this year the PSP version lacks ringside commentary tables, which in the larger console versions are in themselves an interactable and spectacular element: you can crush your opponent on them, breaking them. The sound sector is excellent, indeed extraordinary as regards speech, which will delight all enthusiasts. However, the matter concerning the soundtrack is different, this time far from rich: for most of the time, we will do nothing but listen to the music of the various wrestlers.", "date": "2008-12-15", "grade": "7.5"}
