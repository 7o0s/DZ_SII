It was the last old-fashioned E3 in Los Angeles, the one with exaggeratedly extreme tones and the PlayStation 3 was still trying to take its first, uncertain steps while the whole world wondered who or what would have best explained the nextgen concept. Then there were the various Resistance, Killzone and Uncharted and finally, this 2010, is the custodian of the turn of Quantic Dreams, the software house that Cage himself helped to create and which several years ago tried to revolutionize a genre, that of graphic adventures. In fact, there was Omikron: The Nomad Soul, a timid attempt at an adventure with free roaming traits akin to Grand Theft Auto and with the unexpected cameo of David Bowie and then Fahreneit, the new frontier of graphic adventures, or so we were told, whose sublime plot and magnificent gameplay gimmicks were clubbed to death by a disappointing epilogue and the rampant quick time event syndrome. And that's how we get to Heavy Rain, the first exclusive of 2010 for the Sony home console that enters the market with an overwhelming burden on its shoulders: will David Cage have done it this time to revolutionize the genre? And above all, has the border between videogames and cinema finally been crossed in search of that unique, sublime but still unreachable mix of interactivity and narrative? ~No~ is probably the closest answer to reality. It's all about history... Heavy Rain can be conceptually classified as an adventure with a rather fast pace, enriched by the charm and some gameplay aspects that tend to bring it closer to graphic adventures especially in terms of exploration of the environments and continuation of the plot. The latter revolves around an imaginary serial killer of children. He kidnaps them, keeps them segregated for four days, then drowns them and then abandons them in brownfield sites, near a railway with a small origami in his hand and an orchid on his chest. In the short prologue we will play the role of Ethan Mars, an architect with a wonderful life, married to a beautiful woman and father of two children. Soon the situation will precipitate: Jason is the victim of an accident, while the other child, Shaun becomes the possible seventh kidnapped of the serial killer. The story then develops following in the footsteps of Ethan and three other characters who initially behave like perfect strangers and then cross paths during the narrated vicissitudes by building relationships of love, hate, friendship and antagonism. The beauty of Heavy Rain is all in this wonderful story told that drags the player, forces him to constantly change point of observation, gradually discovering tiny details that will lead him to solve a dramatic case of serial murders, surprising him with at least one exceptional shot scene and dragging it forcefully to the final epilogue. The colors are dark, noir-like and throughout the game there will be continuous references to numerous films including Blade Runner (the rain is absolutely incessant), Se7en (for suspense, thriller component and revelations), Saw (in the trials to which it will be subjected Ethan and his relationship with the serial killer). Heavy Rain is a constant race against time: the narration flows smoothly and quickly and thanks to some investigative implications it manages to make us feel like hunters and prey on more than one occasion, forcing us to take sides, to take a position, almost to cheer for one of the protagonists, to make us feel in difficulty when we are forced to make choices that could significantly change the course of events. Alongside Ethan, we will find and follow the personal evolution of Scott Shelby, a private investigator hired by the families of the victims of the origami killer, an ex-policeman with rather rough manners; Norman Jayden, an FBI agent specializing in criminal psychology with several drug-related problems and sent on the spot by the Bureau in an attempt to catch the criminal; Madison Paige, a beautiful journalist and photographer of a furniture magazine who will find herself involved in the story by pure coincidence due to her insomnia. The tones of Heavy Rain are always adults, its 18+ rating is perfectly justified: the violence is palpable, the strange parent-child relationship is subtly eviscerated and we will constantly have to deal with disturbing situations perfectly outlined by Cage also in their sense of oppression, all in the name of what would you do, how far would you go for love. And that's rightunderline that for once the partial male and female nudity we see quite frequently is always well justified and in line with the narration as well as the only sex scene that finally pushes the videogame medium forward for realism and involvement leaving the shoulders the clumsy and timid attempts we have witnessed in recent years. Maturity is now, unquestionably achieved. Curiosity The Quick Time Event (QTE), literally Event in Quick Times is a very particular game mechanic usually adopted to partially control the protagonist in the cinematic interlude sequences and forces the player to carefully follow what happens on the screen to press buttons or move the controller at the right time. Usually if you fail these sequences you will see the death of the character and it is mandatory to repeat the scene. QTEs have a historical past if we consider that the very first laser games such as Dragon's Lair or Road Blaster (in the early 80s) can already be considered games entirely based on quick time events. In more recent times, however, the use of QTEs has been cleared and modernized above all thanks to two titles: Sega's Shenmue and Sony's God of War. ...but the controls are also fundamental... The camera in the game is automatic: the player simply changes the point of view by alternating between the two, three observation points always available in every scenario and situation by pressing L1. With the left analog moves the character's head and stimulates the rotation of his body, while with R2 he walks forward. The combination of analog + R2 is quite difficult to master in the beginning; it is certainly an excellent idea to increase the player's sense of involvement in the character and make his control realistic but until the end you will never be fully satisfied with this method, far too approximate and dominated by continuous camera changes and various ~jams ~ especially in the tightest spaces. Furthermore, it is not possible to run except in certain situations due to the narration, and therefore especially in larger environments it can be a bit heavy. By holding down L2, the protagonist's thoughts determined by the situation and events will appear on the screen and which we will be able to listen to by pressing the corresponding front key. Often they will act as a guide to action, almost as a suggestion, other times they will serve as a psychological and situational insight, in all cases they will tend to make the player's degree of involvement in Heavy Rain even more palpable and invasive. One really feels part of the mental and physical evolution of the characters and in the most excited, most tense situations, seeing these writings on the screen vibrate, be difficult to read, swirl around the character, credibly restores the confusion and anxiety and manages to deposit it in the hands of the player who will have a hard time figuring out which key to press in that whirlwind of emotions. And the four front buttons, combined with the right analog and the back buttons, will determine the character's possibilities of action. The stick in particular is used for arm and hand movements: opening a door, engaging a gear, opening a door or window, using a switch and so on. The lats tend to be used for the more complex actions or to simulate the legs. The sixaxis is finally exploited in a creative and believable way for sudden and aggressive movements. Finally, the various X, circle, square and triangle come into play during the action sequences, the most agitated and rhythmic ones, in the classic quick time event style. Their use is extreme, omnipresent but perfectly manages to keep the player in a state of constant tension, always ready for some sudden activity to be performed. Here lurks that laser game syndrome beyond Dragon's Lair that seems to worry Heavy Rain's fiercest critics so much. There is no doubt that the game is partially diminished in its depth being practically a succession of QTEs, but it would be really too simplistic to label it in this way. First of all, failure is practically never experienced in these sequences: there is no trial and error typical of quick time events where an incorrect sequence leads to failure or death and therefore to its repetition until it is passed. The action continues if you make a mistake, takes different paths, reaches different endings, penalizes us for the mistake but never makes us experience a sense of frustration so much as to force us to reload a save. Sure, getting all the keys wrong in a sequence can have concatastrophic consequences even up to the death of a character but, mind you, there will never be a game over in the strict sense of the term: the story still goes on and reaches its ending. And as if that weren't enough, these QTEs have an incredible variety linked not only to the different combinations of keys, but precisely to their style of use and representation: the on-screen indications will vibrate, be difficult to read or chaotic depending on the pathos, just like happens with the thoughts of the character. There are situations in which we will have to move the analog slowly, carefully, or repeatedly press the buttons or even gradually increase the number of keys pressed simultaneously. This last type of manual difficulty is brilliant for creating anxiety in the player and stimulating him to feel involved in risky and complicated actions. ...not to mention the gameplay... The game is divided into chapters, about sixty, depending on the actions taken and the story covered and the duration is at least 10 hours, more likely a dozen if you face the sections starring Norman, the FBI agent. It is precisely in its chapters that Heavy Rain tends to be more of a video game in the strict sense of the term, almost a graphic adventure. In fact, we will have to look for clues using a rather sci-fi device made up of glasses and a glove (the ARI system) which, in augmented reality style, highlights any traces of blood, pollen, footprints and so on in the environment. Depending on how many and which clues we will be able to collect, the greater the investigative connections we will be able to make later, within a virtual reality system. We do not hide that more scenarios of this type would have pleased us since we only meet three but nevertheless they perfectly manage to mitigate that partial lack of interactivity and free will that permeates Heavy Rain especially at an inattentive and in-depth look. The scenarios are in fact extremely linear, especially those indoors which literally lack points of interaction; what can or must be done is written in stone by the designers: there are no objects to collect or combine, puzzles to solve or situations to unravel in different ways. Each chapter, as Cage has pointed out at different junctures, begins and ends in a certain way, the player is given the opportunity to face the numerous choices and branches within the same. The outcomes of these choices have repercussions in the following chapters both on a physical level (the various protagonists suffer quite a bit of violence and the consequences can be seen) and on interaction with the various characters and, obviously, in the long run, when at the end of the game the sums are pulled, leading to different epilogues. That's right: Heavy Rain has numerous endings that are literally ~composed~ according to the outcome of the stories of the four protagonists and the result is a rather high degree of replayability (especially for some chapters) in an attempt to discover every aspect of the plot and maybe also collect all the trophies. But how does the progress of a scenario actually take place? Starting from a dual system: there is usually a single, specific action which, once performed, leads to the continuation of the narrative, otherwise blocked until the player intervenes. In the other case, there is a sort of timer which guarantees the player total freedom in the scenario until this (often hidden) timer expires, which automatically starts the next sequence of actions. Typical and characteristic of this mode is the split screen camera which marks its return in a use very similar to what was done with Fahrenheit. The screen literally splits to follow different cameras: on one side we have the player, on the other screen elements and different characters performing their actions. Our goal will usually be to get ahead of our opponents and avoid getting caught in the act. These moments are particularly successful in David Cage's work: the tension is palpable, one feels truly under pressure and part of an interactive drama beyond our control and our actions. Playstation 3 trophies All Heavy Rain trophies are secret, except for five. In addition to the inevitable Platinum we can see the gold one you receive by viewing all the movies or the silver one you get by finishing the game with all the protagonists still alive. In total there are 57 trophies composed largely of numerous bronzes linked to the various choice possibilities offered in the chapters. Aff", "date": "2010-02-10", "grade": "9.4"}
