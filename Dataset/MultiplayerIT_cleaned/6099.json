{"name": "Cyber Sherwood", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/155028-volume-cyber-sherwood.html", "text": "Robin Hood is one of Britain's best-loved folk heroes, so we shouldn't be surprised if the subject of the new title created and produced by the British Mike Bithell revolves around the legends of Sherwood. The story takes place, with some due variations, in a not too distant future between virtual simulations and artificial intelligence, an ideal terrain for testing both the player's cunning and the designer's skill. The plot of Volume is not as complex or elaborate as it is a very creative retelling of the legend of Robin Hood, but in its own way it has a depth that we already saw in Thomas Was Alone, although this time apparently less visible. After the success of Thomas Was Alone, Mike Bithell returns with Volume Steal from the rich to give to the poor In the hundred levels that make up the story mode, Robin Hood becomes Rob Locksley, a young boy skilled in the art of hacking and theft, and Sir Guy of Gisborne is promoted from Sheriff of Nottingham to CEO of an important and prestigious multinational. Although the game is not full of real cutscenes, the story is well narrated by the dialogues of the characters, splendidly interpreted by all strictly British voices (obviously accompanied by subtitles), among which those of Danny Wallace, former narrator of Thomas Was Alone, and Andy Serkis. What makes Volume's story interesting is the personal reinterpretation that Bithell gives to our hero's deeds, because stealing from the rich to give to the poor so dear to the generous outlaw of Sherwood turns into a gesture that goes beyond justice: Locksley in fact, with the help of artificial intelligence Alan and volumetric simulation technology, he reproduces real scenarios in which he simulates his thefts and then broadcasts them over the network to the whole country, and illustrates to the citizens how to carry out the various heists. Locksley therefore never steals from the rich himself, but explains to all the poor how to reappropriate what belongs to them, precisely because the places reproduced in the simulations are the homes and offices of all the men and women who hold the country hostage and its inhabitants with power, corruption and greed. From this twist of the classic story also emerges a singular parallelism between what Locksley does in the game and what many gamers of today are used to doing, i.e. the livestream: the reinterpretation that Bithell gives of the Robin Hood legend is not just a simple reinterpretation in a pseudo cyberpunk key, but it is a small mirror in which to see the habits of today's society and suggests the infinite possibilities that the Net constantly offers. Volumetric simulation Very often the metaphor of the house is used to schematically explain a video game: a house stands thanks to solid foundations and load-bearing structures, enclosed within walls that contain its constructive essence without showing it... but Volume is part of the functionalist current, where all the elements are clearly visible in their integrity and are not afraid to show themselves to the player nor do they need to be hidden or embellished with frills. The heart of the game therefore takes place within the hundred simulation scenarios (all measuring 30 meters by 30) created by Alan for Locksley, in which the player is called to collect all the valuable objects (symbolically represented by gems) scattered for the levels to pass the simulation and enter the next one. Evading surveillance is the first thing Alan will show us: the isometric view allows us to perceive how much shelter the dividing elements offer and the light cone placed in front of the enemies will indicate their visual range. Finishing in the enemy's visual range means inevitably being discovered but not necessarily finished: if we are fast and stealthy enough, in fact, we will be able to escape and avoid starting over from the last activated checkpoint given that, once we leave the enemies' visual range for a few seconds, these they will desist from pursuing us, first stopping and then returning to their patrol area. The further we progress in the game, the more weapons and gadgets we will have available in our arsenal, thus adding variety and obviously adapting to the growing obstacles as we progress through the adventure. The plot of Volume is not only a delightful side element but it is what justifies the gameplay itself: in fact, since it is a simulation created for ~illustrative~ purposes, all the elements present in the various schemes are rigid and follow a practically total mechanical rhythm. However, this is not a disadvantage since the extremely mechanical behavior of artificial intelligence does notmica and the functioning of the various devices supplied to Locksley, transform the experience into something very similar to a puzzle game with stealth elements. Many could define limited artificial intelligence but we don't feel like supporting this definition, precisely because it doesn't coincide with the extreme simulation experience it transmits: to solve the various schemes (very often based on multiple solutions) it is first necessary to understand how the various types of enemies react to our inputs, how the scenario evolves around us and so on, in a long simulation where you try and try again (with the help of countless checkpoints!) until you find the solution. In this way the typical elements of the stealth genre are disassembled and reassembled at the developer's pleasure and according to the level design, proposing a different challenge each time. Volume was certainly created by almost brutally following a series of rules, the same ones that then mark the rhythms of the game. The same rigidity was also used to define the design of the title, however making a leap in level compared to its predecessor: if the platform style of Thomas Was Alone has evolved into more mature puzzle/stealth dynamics, so it was also for the graphics that propose a protagonist in three dimensions instead of two, but always respecting a clean and rigorous design that is well suited to the title. The musical accompaniment is diametrically opposed, proposing dramatic melodies and great atmosphere. The sound effects are also very pleasant, often accompanied by small graphic effects (such as the tiny shock wave generated by Locksley's whistle), where however the one dedicated to our sighting by enemies is quite out of tune, with too serious music that for a long time going tired, especially if you are trying to overcome a difficult obstacle. Endless thefts Everything we do in the game will be timed to the thousandth of a second, which might appeal to players looking for an extra degree of challenge. Thus, if solving the various puzzles of the levels weren't enough for us, we can try to do it as quickly and effectively as possible. The game, as we said, often offers various solutions, some safer and at the same time slower and others more rash and rapid: it will be necessary to decide whether to compete for the best time (which can be viewed at the end of the level in the online ranking) and often it will not be at all simple. To be able to state this in some diagrams we have abandoned our relaxed and cautious style to understand what was actually the degree of challenge required for the time trials: know that in order to be able to score the best time it is necessary to know the environment perfectly, calibrate the moves to the centimeter and take the right pace. We predict that this particular mode will lead Volume to be a favorite game for speedrun lovers. The story is also accompanied by an editing option for volumetric simulations, in which we can try our hand at creating new schemes to then be proposed to all the other players. Once the adventure is over, we will therefore be able to dedicate ourselves to improving our times in the standard levels or playing new ones among those offered by the community and, like any game that offers customizable features, Volume is also among the potentially infinite products. When we spoke of brutal rules and schemes we were not referring only to those imposed on the player, but also to those placed by the editor and consequently also by players on other players; putting at the user's disposal the same elements used to create the story, the editor mode of Volume shows in a practical way all the subtleties of its level design, almost whispering in our ear ~there is no trick and there is no deception , if I did it, you can do it too~, demonstrating that certain things must be fully understood to be appreciated.", "date": "2015-08-25", "grade": "9.0"}
