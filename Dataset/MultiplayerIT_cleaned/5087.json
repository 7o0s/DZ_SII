We can include Bubble Witch Saga 3 in the latter category of products, because although the basic structure is substantially the same as Puzzle Bobble, the progenitor of this type of puzzle game, the King series has been able to insert some variants capable of giving rather peculiar identity to games. As can be expected from the publisher in question, the result of this refinement of the classic mechanics is a perfect time-sucking machine, which easily captures players in its coils, pushing them to move forward, game after game, in its easy progression along the extremely smooth learning curve. It is also a rather honest free-to-play, which does not rely too much on micro-transactions, leaving a good freedom of choice in this regard and dedicating in-app purchases to particularly assiduous players, a system already tested by the global success of Candy Crush . Although it has a relative meaning, the general presentation of the game is also quite accurate, with the side elements that create a nice and magical atmosphere, facilitating the affection for the little witch Stella, the black cat and the other bizarre characterizing elements, giving a very precise identity to Bubble Witch Saga 3, while the presence of secondary elements such as the house to be built guarantees an additional area in which to vent the collecting craze and the search for rewards and bonuses. The classic color ball matching game is perfected in Bubble Witch Saga 3 Matter of priorities The basic mechanics are always the same: you find yourself having to shoot colored spheres from the bottom up, also taking advantage of the rebounds and calculating the trajectories in order to associate the colors and make the complex conformations of the spheres that fall from the side disappear top of the screen. However, Bubble Witch Saga 3 introduces fundamental innovations to this base with the need to complete specific objectives within each level. The missions are of various types and although they still require you to associate the colored spheres by throwing them upwards, they have the advantage of changing the priorities and therefore the strategic setting of the game, adding a further puzzle game layer to a mechanic otherwise already seen innumerable times. We therefore find ourselves having to free owls by approaching them and associating them with the right color, free fairies with a similar system or try to open a gap between the accumulated spheres in order to make a ghost flee upwards, just to name a few. A tactical element is given by the possibility of using the special powers provided by the Black cat by accumulating the excess spheres inside his hair, thus having further tools to solve more complex situations. It is clear that the repetition of objectives and game mechanics, in the long progression between levels in the hunt for the evil cat Wilbur, can lead to tedium, but in perfect King style the game is based on a perfect balance of elements between immediacy, collectability, characterization and controls that make it always desirable even for short games spread over a very long period of time.", "date": "2017-01-21", "grade": "8.0"}
