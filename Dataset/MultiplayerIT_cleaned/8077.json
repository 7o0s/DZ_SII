Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Turn-based strategy may not be the most popular videogame genre in recent years, but they are certainly products that take advantage of the touch interface rather than run into problems of various kinds. RAD Soldiers is but the latest example of this. Developed by Splash Damage, team authoring the controversial Brink, the game sees us control a handful of soldiers in single player missions or in asynchronous online multiplayer, a mode that gives each participant plenty of time to make their move and send it to the servers, complete with a notification service that warns us when the opponent has finished his maneuver and therefore it's up to us. We are faced with a freemium title, but broad-minded: beyond the expansions (there are two, at the moment), which must be paid for separately, in fact, the RAD Soldiers experience can be enjoyed completely free of charge , completing solo or competitive missions to get experience points and gold coins to spend on the purchase of new characters, new weapons and items. The starting screen allows us to access the ~barracks~, to view and modify our units in various ways: assigning them a name to our liking, changing their equipment or appearance, and so on. Then there is the inevitable ~shop~, where you can use virtual currency or real money; and finally the ~play~ option, from which you can access online games or single player campaign missions. The latter includes a simple but complete tutorial, as well as three difficulty levels that each contain various levels to complete by scoring the best possible performance. We soon realize that the single game performs an important preparatory function for multiplayer, that is, it allows us to level up, obtain gold coins and unlock new soldiers so that we can better compare ourselves with online opponents. Shoot me I'll shoot you There's no need to analyze how good RAD Soldiers matchmaking is, because in its small way it's pretty much perfect. The game allows us to select an opponent at random, enter his nickname or invite him via e-mail, and in the first two cases the activation of the game is instantaneous. During our turn we move the units available, we place them on the map in the way that seems most appropriate to us and we pass the hand, waiting for what our opponent will do. As with all asynchronous multiplayer games, it is clear that matches can last a few minutes if both players are ready and willing, as well as drag on for days if you only make a move when you have some free time to to do it. It is clear that a few minutes are enough to get organized with a friend and start fast and engaging battles, rather than trying your luck with a stranger who immediately turns out to be slow and listless. But how exactly does the action take place? As in any strategic game, we have the possibility of moving and attacking with each of our soldiers during the turn and the interface will show us at any time which ~boxes~ to move to in order to carry out an offensive, as well as its effectiveness based on to the selected character and equipped weapon. Taking cover behind a low wall can increase our resistance to blows, while any maneuver depends on the energy points we have left, including special abilities such as the headshot (which doubles the damage caused by a sniper's shot), invisibility, the grenade, the bombardment and the inevitable medical kits to recover some energy between one firefight and another. The developers have developed a really excellent touch control system, adding buttons to cancel any unwanted actions and allowing us to zoom or rotate the map at will. All this is supported by really nice graphics to look at, which winks at Team Fortress 2 in terms of style and boasts well-drawn and animated characters, as well as an excellent use of colors.", "date": "2012-12-29", "grade": "8.0"}
