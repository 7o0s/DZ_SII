The title of the small Finnish company, which winks at Angry Birds, without succeeding too much to tell the truth, starts from a narrow and insignificant plot, as an excuse to ~stage~ (so to speak) a sequence of screens (a hundred) to overcome trying to knock down targets on the screen without wasting too many balls. In the role of a promising former tennis player named Pete Pegassi, whose career was cut short due to the abuse of an energy drink named Explodz, the gamer must in fact take revenge on the multinational producer of the drink and on all those who abuse it. All with the help of his racket and, initially, the relative tennis balls. Tennis in the Face arrives on PlayStation 4, but maybe it was better to stay on mobile Playstation 4 trophies The game offers users twelve Trophies: 7 bronze, 4 silver and 1 gold. To obtain them, for example, it is enough to KO six enemies with the explosion of a single Explodz or hit five of them in the head with a single serve. The rarer one, however, the gold trophy, requires victory against a somewhat particular team, which we will not reveal to you for spoiler reasons. I'll kick you! The purpose of the title is precisely to overcome a series of levels of increasing difficulty by breaking down the ~enemies~ on the screen, as happened in the production of Rovio Entertainment from which it takes the formula. Except that in our case these are crazy clowns, crooked cops and wacky characters of all kinds, all related as mentioned before to the abuse of Explodz. The gamer has three shots per square available to be made with the help of the faithful racket: just choose a trajectory and direct the ball (or what is made available) towards it, also trying to take advantage of any obstacles, walls and other elements scenes to make it bounce and thus develop different and effective paths to eliminate the targets. All trying to waste as few shots as possible, in order to obtain high scores or unlock special prizes, such as the Junior Medals, helping when possible with objects present in the scenario, such as explosives or blunt objects, to facilitate the task, given that by exploding or falling from above these can generate real combos. By overcoming the various levels and earning points, in addition to unlocking the following areas, you can also try to climb a special online ranking to excel against other users and friends. Too bad that to partially spoil the fun there is certainly not optimal physics, which sees the balls go a bit on their own business, and the impossibility of regulating the power of the shots, which therefore always remains the same. In our view, being able to dose the blows could have led to different approaches in certain scenarios, giving the gameplay a certain strategic component, albeit minimal. Which, considering that in the long run the game scheme remains substantially unchanged despite a hundred levels, would have partially reduced the risk of boredom which is always around the corner. In any case, in the light of what has just been described, one sometimes gets the feeling that the success or failure of a session depends more on chance than on the real ability of the user. To complete the picture of the 10Tons production there is a technical sector without excessive pretensions, with clean and colorful graphics reminiscent of some Cartoon Network cartoons, taken from the mobile edition and reported without any retouches on PlayStation 4 Therefore, even with a thousand legitimate justifications given the nature of the product, the aesthetic sector remains nice to look at, but poor in terms of detail and quality. The design of Pete Pegassi's character and that of the mad scientists of the multinational company that produces the doping drink are particularly nice. The audio sector, on the other hand, is ugly which, apart from a couple of effects, is limited to a single accompanying melody for the entire duration of the game, which after a few games can definitely annoy and lead the player to disable the sound.", "date": "2014-12-19", "grade": "6.0"}
