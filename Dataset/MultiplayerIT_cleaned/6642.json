{"name": "NEKOPARA Vol. 1", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/143070-nekopara-vol-1-gattine-allupate.html", "text": "As you will know if you follow the PC and Steam world a bit, in recent years the offer of visual novels and appointment simulators has multiplied which, from niche genres, have established themselves among an increasingly large number of people. These are story-driven products that require you to read more than play. Without going too far, for further details we refer you to an old special we dedicated to the genre, where you will find all the information you need to start understanding it. Unfortunately, one of the major problems of Western visual novels is proving to be their most important distribution channel, namely Steam, due to its rules relating to adult products. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 was born as a visual novel with eroge content, i.e. with pornographic scenes to support the narrative. Indeed, in fact we are talking about a preponderance of eroticism over all other content, given that the plot is only an excuse to represent one of the trendiest fetishes currently in Japan, i.e. slave cat girls dressed as maids who give it away easy. This is a point to be taken into consideration, because if, for example, in other visual novels such as ~Cho Dengeki Stryker~ the removal of the erotic scenes has not led to a qualitative collapse, because it is a work fundamentally focused on the story told, so as in ~If My Heart Had Wings~, where even their lack was felt more, in NEKOPARA Vol. 1 it is instead decisive. The latest effort by NEKO WORKs is in fact a real ode to winking which, given the genre, can only end in bed in amazing sex scenes with the kittens as protagonists. Or at least it should, given that very few are seen in the Steam version of coitus. The reason, and this is where we come full circle, is that Steam guidelines do not permit the sale of explicit sexual content. The situation that has arisen is paradoxical: visual novels are establishing themselves in the West thanks to the Steam showcase (even before they existed, but were sold on little-known sites, if not by ultra-enthusiasts), but the public often enjoys versions neutered, complaining about it, but not considering buying the full versions in other shops. How to install the adult version on the steam one? Are you among those who want to play the adult version of NEKOPARA Vol. 1 by unlocking Steam achievements and enjoying all the services of the Valve client? This possibility is not officially supported by the publisher and developers, but there is a quick and easy way to do it. First you need to buy the Steam version, then the adult version from the DL Site site (we can't give you the link for obvious reasons, but it's not difficult to find by searching with any search engine). Install the Steam version, then download and unzip the adult version files. Copy the files of this latest version to the folder where the Steam version is installed, replacing them but not deleting the specific files of the Valve client. It doesn't take much, what does it take? If it doesn't work, try the following: After replacing the files, right click on the title of the game installed in your library; Open settings and select boot options; Add the line: -steam=~yes~ Porn without porn? No sense! In these conditions it is really difficult to evaluate NEKOPARA Vol. 1 and the version for everyone must be distinguished from the one for adults. Let's say that the first is a bad visual novel that tells the education of a group of buxom cat girls at work in a bar, while the second is a decent hentai work with beautiful drawings and above-average production values, complete with animations of girls' breasts dancing according to their movements. If you want a comparison that makes you understand the situation better, take the best porn movie possible and remove the porn parts. What would remain if not the classic pretext story that serves as a nuance between couplings of various kinds and nature? Here, without the more explicit erotic parts NEKOPARA Vol. 1 is a mediocre pretext story. Sure, the drawings are still excellent, but playing the game on the sex slave / master dichotomy, where the player is essentially called to give vent to his erotic imagination close-handed on objects of desire that are not too obscure (not for nothing at the beginning of the story the first two cat girls arrive in cardboard boxes like any parcel), what about a completely censored work? For this reason, the new effort of Sekai Project must coexist with two differen judgmentsti: one negative for the Steam version, the other positive for the adult version. Some final details At this point some of you may be wondering what playful content NEKOPARA Vol. 1 offers. The answer is simple: none. It is a pure visual novel, with no crossroads and no choices to make. Then read and click on the mouse or keyboard to move to the next line of text. At most you can save or you can remove the interface, all obviously feasible with one hand to keep the other free to put force feedback into practice (it's no joke, the so-called ~freehand~ mode is typical of the genre and is specially designed to ensure a peaceful masturbation). Overall, by reading everything, you can go on for six hours, up to the non-finale which precludes the arrival of a new episode. Visual novel enthusiasts know what they're getting into. The others be careful. NEKOPARA Vol. 1 proves that porn without porn is meaningless, but also that one should never despair", "date": "2015-01-06", "grade": "7.5"}
