{"name": "Dead or Alive 3-PAL-", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-or-alive-3-pal-.html", "text": "A bit of history Born on a Sega bar card, later landed on Sony consoles, Dead or Alive has finally become the standard bearer of the new Microsoft console. In fact, Team Ninja gave life to Dead or Alive years ago on Sega's legendary Model 2 and the new fighting game, born as a coin-op, was so successful that it was transported in 1998 to PlayStation and Saturn. High resolution graphics and spectacular animations were the winning aspects of a game that for some time was even considered the best alternative to the excessive power of the Tekken series. After the first came the second chapter, this time on Dreamcast, and for Dead or Alive the transition from 32 to 128 bit also meant a further qualitative increase in the series, finally able to find a worthy place among the most acclaimed three-dimensional fighting games such as the aforementioned Tekken, Virtua Fighter and the more recent Soul Calibur. A year and a half ago, Dead or Alive 2 was finally ported to PlayStation 2 in a virtually identical version to the Dreamcast original that did little honor to the potential of Sony hardware. Since then, the story of the game has been enriched with new and surprising chapters that have led to the exclusive development of Dead or Alive 3 for XBox. I announce that the third chapter contains very few new features compared to its predecessor in terms of playability, but what that it offers us, especially on the technical side, is more than enough to make it light years ahead not only of DOA2 but also of the competition. Greetings to the newcomers... Dead or Alive 3 picks up where we left off with DOA2. All the features of the previous chapter are in fact also present in the new production with some additions that will make fans of the series happy. The sexy component of the characters, which has always been the workhorse of Tecmo's fighting game, is stronger than ever and all seven female wrestlers boast dizzying curves and super-plus size. The option for setting the bouncing breast is missing (I'll leave the Italian translation up to you :) ) but it doesn't matter. Compared to the American version of the game, some new costumes have been added and I recommend you in particular to take a look at Tina's secondary costume more suitable for an ~ambiguous~ movie actress rather than a wrestler. The characters are sixteen in total, with three highly appreciated new entries that further enrich the already well-assorted roster of martial arts masters: Hitomi, Christie and Brad Wong. Hitomi, an 18-year-old girl of a Japanese mother and a German father, is an expert in karate and loves chocolate cakes. Christie, on the other hand, is a ruthless silver-haired assassin who practices She Quan and has a hobby of driving. Finally, Brad Wong is an unemployed 30-year-old, a practitioner of Zui Ba Xian Quan (the classic ~drunk style~), addicted to wandering and alcohol. There is no shortage of loyal Jann Lee (my favorite :) ), emulator of Bruce Lee; Zack, Thai boxing champion and Dennis Rodman impersonator; the sweet yet deadly Lei Fang and an assortment of ninja warriors that could not be missed considering the name of the team that created the game. Being a fighting game, the plot certainly does not play a fundamental role, despite this, each character has its own story which is developed thanks to good quality full motion movies. A walk in the woods The game modes available are numerous as always even if I would have expected some news: Story Mode, Time Attack Mode, Survival Mode, Tag Battle Mode, Versus Mode, Watch Mode and Sparring Mode. As far as playability is concerned, the innovations are rather limited although of no less importance. The control system already adopted on the PlayStation 2 has been entirely transported to the Xbox and the Xbox pad is well suited to use with a fighting game. As expected, only three keys are required to play Dead or Alive 3, while the others are mostly combinations of these keys that allow you to perform special moves or combos. The ~Counter~ (the classic countermoves) are still massively present although their execution is less devastating than in DOA2. The remaining moves have almost all been adopted from the second chapter of the game with some additions not to be despised. A pleasant novelty is the possibility of moving in depth in the scenarios by pressing the directional arrow twice, thus being able to travel far and wide through the settings with greater speed. The scenarios are perhaps the greatest innovation of DOA3 as they are now much larger and more completeactive than in the past. The forest level, for example, is incredibly extensive, including dozens of trees, rocks, and even a river. During the fight it will be possible to walk inside it and it will take a few minutes to explore it from top to bottom. Other scenarios are instead characterized by multiple levels, accessible by breaking a wall or falling from a cliff as for example in the suggestive setting of ~Lost World~ in which you fight on top of some mountain peaks. Pushing the opponent towards the overhang leads to a new peak, different from the previous one, and the downward descent can continue indefinitely. In the Azuchi stage, on the other hand, you fight inside a medieval Japanese castle and by breaking through the wall you pass first on the roof and then in the courtyard of the castle. The Next Generation Dead or Alive 3 was born as a sequel to Dead or Alive 2, but above all it was conceived as a killer application for Xbox, as a game that knew how to exploit the potential of XBox hardware better than all the others and, judging by the results, Team Ninja seems to have easily hit the target. As perhaps only Halo was able to do, DOA3 introduces us to a new world made of high-resolution textures, cinematic special effects and finally ~next generation~ graphics. According to the programmers, there are four times more polygons than DOA2 on screen, and it's no wonder. The environments are huge and characterized by a myriad of objects covered with excellent textures. How can we forget the amazing realization of the water surfaces, characterized by spectacular effects of reflection and distortion, or the breaking of the stone tiles, following falls, in the stage of the Tao temple. The same heavy restyling work was dedicated to the characters, now much more detailed thanks to both clothes made ~real~ by stupendous textures and a series of dynamic details of the hairstyles and costumes themselves. Definitely less exciting is the sound part of the game. While the voices (in Japanese) and sound effects are excellent, the music is rather anonymous. In this case, there is a lack of some epic theme such as those that have characterized Namco's fighting games in the past. Game over Dead or Alive 3 is everything we want from a fighting game and maybe even more. The incredible graphics are just one of the advantages of a game that has undoubtedly made great strides since its debut in the arcade until today. The resemblance to the predecessor is evident and perhaps excessive, but this is certainly not a bad thing since DOA2 is already a very fun game. Tekken and Virtua Fighter can probably offer something more in terms of depth but what Tecmo's game loses in this respect, it regains instead in terms of immediacy and spectacularity. Probably in the future Soul Calibur 2 will bring the fighting game genre to even higher levels, but until then no pretext can prevent you from rushing to your trusted shopkeeper to buy Dead or Alive 3. Pros: Amazing graphics Immediate and spectacular 3 new characters Huge and interactive arenas Cons: Anonymous music Few new features compared to DOA2 Materials: Tips Dead or alive? Finally here we are! After months of anxious waiting seasoned with controversy and words, often uttered inappropriately, Dead or Alive 3 makes its triumphal debut in the Old Continent. It seems like an eternity since that morning last May when I first saw the game in motion and also the now legendary phrase pronounced by Sandy Duncan and Tomonobu Itagaki during E3 2001 (~Dead or Alive 3 is an exclusive XBox because other consoles can't run it~) seems remote. When said earlier it no longer matters and it is high time that facts take the place of words. On balance, is Dead or Alive 3 really that milestone in the genre of fighting games that we were promised and have long dreamed of? The answer can only be a convinced and spontaneously born yes after just a few minutes of play, having remained petrified in front of the shocking visual splendor of the new game created by Team Ninja.", "date": "2002-03-13", "grade": null}
