Mechassault offers two game possibilities, one single and one multiplayer, which can be exploited locally, by connecting multiple Xboxes together, or online, via the Xboxlive service. In the single player mode, you are a mercenary in the pay of Wolf's Dragoons, one of the oldest and most respected charter pilot associations in the entire Inner Sphere. During an invasion of a small and seemingly insignificant planet, you are tasked with putting out of order the orbital cannons that threaten to abort the mission in the bud. However, things don't go as planned and your mothership crashes, leaving you behind enemy lines on an unknown planet, where you will find the grim resistance of the sect called The Word of Blake waiting for you. You will soon discover that the sectarians are really possessed, fanatics with great almost religious fervor and, above all, very advanced equipment and technology. Initially, you are equipped with a light mech that, at 30 tons, proves to be agile and with enough firepower to hold off the first feeble waves of enemies. The first mission serves as a tutorial and is essential to familiarize yourself with the control system, which in any case is not new as it has already been encountered in Halo and Enclave: the mech is moved with the left stick, the view is rotated with the right stick, with the right trigger you fire. It is not possible to choose the armaments of the mech, a choice that I feel I can share given the decidedly arcade nature of this title, but at the end of each mission new mechs are unlocked which can be used as desired in the following ones. Choosing the right robot is crucial in many missions, as the offensive, defensive and evasion characteristics of the metal behemoths are different and not all mechs are suitable for every situation. Continuing in the game you come to control increasingly heavier and slower mechs, but equipped with more destructive arsenals. The heart of Mechassault, however, always remains the same: shoot and destroy, without too much hesitation. It must be admitted that it is damned fun to wander around the city, valleys and hills, between lakes, waterfalls and rivers with our hyper-technological and heavily armed pile of scrap metal, dispensing explosive wise advice to the unbelieving Blakites. In the case of the multiplayer mode, however, you can play in teams or all against all in different types of game and in a frenetic and adrenaline-pumping destructive sabbath. With Xboxlive, then, the fun will be even higher: mocking your American friend, perhaps with the voice disguised as a voice communicator, while you smooth his shoulder blades with missile launchers, will certainly be a priceless experience. The stick responds well. A great satisfaction when playing Mechassault comes from the great interactivity with the scenarios. The mech leaves footprints on the ground, overwhelms trees, light vehicles, destroys buildings and bridges. The feeling in driving is reproduced quite faithfully, although it does not reach the levels of Steel Battalion which is placed on a more simulative level. You are not behind the wheel of a sports car and feel the tens of tons of the biped accelerate and brake following the physical laws of inertia as it should be, but this does not affect in such a way as to make the game frustrating or slow , On the contrary. The duels against the Blakiti's mechs are most often fights to the death, often you are attacked from several fronts and only a careful attack and cover strategy allows you to save the fur and continue the mission, also thanks to an intelligence artificial above average. Enemy robots camouflage themselves, use jet thrusters to take off and sneak up on you, alternate fire of their weapons exactly as you do to avoid overheating them. As in any self-respecting arcade of this genre, in fact, the weapons tend to overheat with continued use. This peculiarity is evident in the advanced levels where the more powerful weapons of the assault mechs produce an enormous amount of heat forcing the pilot to alternate between various offensive opportunities. In this regard, the interaction with the surrounding environment is fundamental: entering the water (not too deep so as not to suffer damage from flooding) causes the temperature to drop much more rapidly, just as in the levels on the snow the harsh climate will favor dissipation thermal. In Mechassault the weather conditions are also variable and the pouring rain in many cases proves to be a faithful ally. Interact with the outsideror it doesn't just mean giving the robot a footbath in the rivers, but also observing warehouses and buildings that are damaged if we decide to try to enter the mech through the back door, miserably stamping ourselves on the reinforced concrete. After all, 60 tons against a wall is bad for the wall, of course. Ultimately, it must be said that the single-player campaign moves on predefined tracks and does not allow too many freedoms due to the checkpoint structure, arriving at which certain contingencies are always and in any case triggered. However, this choice is not too rigid, given that each internship can be tackled and overcome, choosing from a good variety of alternative routes. If we add to this that it is not always necessary to complete all the objectives of each single mission in a pre-established order, Mechassault's linearity becomes much less predictable and less limiting than one might believe. The game situations vary from mission to mission: you can proceed with circumspection to explore the surroundings, as well as sound the charge and go on to destroy everything that moves. To top it all off there are also the usual power ups that allow you to increase the destructive power of the weapons installed or to recover the energy lost in combat. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Joy for the eyes The mech models are particularly well defined, covered with spot-on and dirty textures at the right point, to remind us that what we are piloting is not an expensive plastic toy. Damaged robots progressively lose agility and speed. Sometimes it can happen to see enemies lose a mechanical limb and in case of critical damage, finally, the mech limps and drags on in despair. On the animation front, therefore, nothing can be complained about. The special effects play an extremely important part in the cosmetics of the game. The explosions are very beautiful, as are the light effects generated by spotlights or weapons. Wherever you turn, then, you can enjoy the sight of particle effects, ranging from the sprays of water raised by the mech's legs, to the splashes of rain that rage on the armor, from the sparks that erupt from the damaged areas, to the glass that explodes shattering. Speaking of glass and the like, it is impossible not to notice the care taken in the management of the destruction of buildings, thanks to which the damage suffered by the various buildings is not only reflected in the change of texture, but also on a structural level. The possibility of opening holes in the walls of a hangar with missile shots is definitely appreciable, until it collapses on itself in some of the most realistic animations remembered in a game of the genre. The framerate is stable and almost never uncertain, only a couple of times have I encountered a small hesitation in particularly excited moments, but you really have to work hard to be able to notice it. On closer inspection, a small negative note on the graphic aspect can also be moved to Mechassault and concerns the workmanship of the bodies of water, some textures of the ground and some rocks, which perhaps could be improved. However, these defects are small compared to the beauty we will find ourselves in front of. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Explosions in front and behind me, mayday! The audio sector of the title of the Day 1 studios performs its duty very well, to reach moments of absolute impact in the case of use of the 5.1 system. The noise of the explosions is deep and powerful and will satisfy the lucky owners of a nice subwoofer; even the sound produced by weapons is realistic, and the positional audio allows you to hear the hiss of missiles as they graze you. Small acoustic signallers complete the job, warning of the low energy level or overheating of the weapons, completing the information framework needed during the game and this removes any need for any dedicated instrumentation. The in-game voices, in English and without subtitles, are well characterized. The lion's share is played by the dialogues between you and your base, but it happens to intercept communications between the enemy leader and some pilots you come across, also excellent. The pleasant music adapts to the game situation, as it ranges from almost epic melodies in some exploratory sections, up to betweenseats of electric guitar in moments of more agitated action. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***][***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Comment As you will have understood from the body of the review, we are dealing with a very well-finished product with a marked arcade nature, which will satisfy all those who are looking for a game that can offer many hours of fun without reservations. The single player campaign lasts about ten hours and my advice is to set the difficulty so as not to play at an easy or normal level, so as to lengthen the longevity of this title, which will receive further lifeblood from the contents that will be made available available via Xboxlive. Play it solo, invite your friends home for deathmatches and, in March, dust it off by taking advantage of the Xboxlive support and the add-ons that will be made available on the internet: new robots, new maps, new missions to download and play. Adrenaline flows freely, destroying entire cities has never been so much fun, dueling against opposing mechs has never been so fun, so what's keeping you from buying Mechassault? Pros -Detailed mech models, great special effects -Multiplayer mode -Xbox live support and downloadable add-ons -Furious, adrenaline-pumping, pure action: easy to pick up and hard to put down Cons -Hardcore BattleTech fans they could turn up their noses at the simplifications made to the overheating, armament and armor system. -Some textures here and there are not fully convincing The BattleTech license still survives: after years and after the collapse of FASA Corporation, the house that gave birth to one of the most popular science fiction tabletop games of the nineties, the metal giants battle it out again on Xbox. The first product of the BattleTech line was released in the now distant 1984. Inspired at least partially by the giant robots and mechanized follies that raged in those years in the States, from the animated series Transformers to the bipeds of Star Wars, the game was a mix between an rpg and a war strategy with a sci-fi setting. The original name BattleDroids was later changed following film rights issues with Lucasfilm. Giant robots have always exerted a considerable fascination on kids: BattleTech, moreover, offered a world endowed with unprecedented complexity and vastness, to which disproportionate quantities of expansions, additional sets of rules, gadgets, models and anything that could keep the enthusiast's interest alive and, at the same time, bring new recruits closer, or simply create turnover thanks to merchandising and the exploitation of the license in sectors that were not strictly linked to the world of paper role-playing games. With the advent of microcomputers and consoles, and later personal computers, it was reasonable to expect the arrival of video games using this historic license. After more than a decade, FASA is part of Microsoft, the nineties are a thing of the past, the eighties remind us of the Jurassic and we have already witnessed the birth of the MechCommander line of strategic games and the first-person mech simulations of the MechWarrior series on PCs. Mechassault draws mainly from the second type of video game, but the goal of the MicroSoft title is to satisfy the hardcore gamer without driving him crazy in the myriad of controls, options and settings, which would also scare any newbie. It remains only to find out if the Day 1 studios game succeeds in this noble intention.", "date": "2003-01-09", "grade": null}
