While obtaining great favor from the critics, the title it has never gone beyond a small niche of enthusiasts concentrated mainly in its country of origin. The sequels released up to 2009 on home consoles, a questionable chapter for PSP and numerous and very little memorable spin-offs for mobile devices have not helped to expand the catchment area of a series that would have deserved much better fortunes. Now the Katamari Damacy Reroll here is trying to reverse the trend, offering the very first episode (unreleased in Europe) in full form to the vast PC and Nintendo Switch audience, with the benefits of a slight graphic improvement and a budget price. We have thoroughly tested the version for the hybrid console of the Kyoto house, and in this review we try to explain why it is probably the ideal platform to appreciate (whether it's the first time or not) this crazy and hilarious video game. What is Katamari Damacy First, we need to introduce Katamari Damacy to those who have never even heard of it. In the bizarre narrative premises of the title, the King of the Cosmos has inadvertently destroyed all the celestial bodies of the universe, with the exception of the Earth: to remedy his carelessness, the sovereign sends his son, Prince Ouji, right on our planet, instructing him to accumulate as many objects as possible to allow him to reform stars and planets. As if all this weren't already absurd enough, it is the collection tool entrusted to the tiny prince that represents the climax of madness: it is in fact a sphere (the katamari, in fact) that has the power to incorporate anything that is smaller than of its diameter, and that our hero must roll through the various levels in order to recover all the required materials. The more things you invest with the katamari, the more its dimensions increase, allowing Ouji to point to objects of ever greater size: thus a circular system is triggered which represents to all intents and purposes the progression model of each stage, with the sphere initially measuring a few centimeters and eventually literally encompassing everything that ends up in its path, be these people, cars, buildings and so on and so forth. Gameplay and controls Those who have had the privilege of playing the original Katamari Damacy will find the exact same contents in this remastered. The campaign therefore winds through a series of levels marked by the same objective - that is to bring the katamari to the minimum dimensions required by the king of the cosmos within a limited time - but with occasional variables that infuse a bit of variety to everything: in some stage for example it is required to collect the greatest number of similar objects, in others it may be necessary to avoid certain elements and so on. What has been and continues to be the added value of the title is a design that expertly doses insanity and accuracy: therefore, at first glance, the scenarios may seem like senseless jumbles of objects, while in reality they are specifically designed to provide the player a rigorous sandbox in which to proceed as he sees fit in the process of growing his katamari. Lucidity and madness are two constants in Katamari Damacy Reroll, a dualism that is also reflected in the scalability of the gaming experience: the game can offer an adequate challenge to those wishing to aim for the highest scores, but at the same time it is so immediate and cheeky as to able to be appreciated even by those who are not very familiar with video games and can have fun even just watching the joyful chaos that pervades the screen. Also thanks to a control system that was already perfect at the time and which fortunately hasn't been modified, with the analog sticks that are tilted in the same direction to push the sphere in the respective direction and which instead must be alternated to manage the rotation. One of those typical cases in which the commands are much easier to try than to explain, to the point that the alternative configurations created for this remastered do not make much sense to exist. Looking for a flaw in Katamari Damacy Reroll, one could say that it ends a bit quickly, without the forgettable two-player component being able to offer a valid extension to longevity. In this sense, some extra content would have been welcome, but it must be said that it is easy to repeat the internships just for the sake of doing it.or, helped in this case by the portable mode of Nintendo Switch which constitutes an undoubted added value. Style and music From a strictly technical point of view, there is little to say about the work done by the developers on Katamari Damacy Reroll: apart from a dutiful increase in resolution, a general cleaning and a repositioning of the on-screen indicators, the game has the same appearance as the original for PlayStation 2, with all its adorable edginess. The world of Katamari Damacy is in fact cubed and naive due to a precise stylistic choice that still amazes today for its effectiveness: it is impossible to remain indifferent to the multitude of oddities that one sees during the rolling of the Ouji Prince, unless one experiences a total idiosyncrasy for Japanese humor. That said, the Namco Bandai title can also be genuinely spectacular when in a matter of minutes it makes the player go from collecting chocolates on a kitchen table to engulfing merchant ships as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Even in the audio sector Katamari Damacy Reroll is a riot of ideas, from the King of the Cosmos who expresses himself through scratching to the sound effects that accompany the collection of individual objects (the screams of humans in particular are simply hilarious), obviously without forgetting an accompaniment musical as eclectic as it is exciting, which juggles between j-pop, jazz, samba and swing songs all very catchy, not to mention a title track that we would not hesitate to define epochal.", "date": "2018-12-11", "grade": "9.0"}
