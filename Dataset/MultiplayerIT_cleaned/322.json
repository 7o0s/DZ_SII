{"name": "Football Manager 2007 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-manager-2007-recensione.html", "text": "User friendly It is no coincidence that after the introductory part of the review we are going to recall the in-depth study published on our pages about a month ago. Indeed, one of the biggest innovations of FM2007 lies in the redesign of the interface by the developers, intent on offering the best tools for a gaming experience that is as gratifying as possible: on the other hand, this need arises from the number of elements present in the inside of FM, destined to increase every year following the innovations introduced by SIGames. In this sense, the first novelty occurs in the match creation phase, where a wizard has been introduced that allows you to make championship selections and add new coaches through a few simple clicks, after which you can launch into the new adventure managerial. A small parenthesis, given that we find ourselves discussing the start of the game, concerns the possibility of choosing a sort of background for each new manager added, on the basis of which to select one's fame in a nutshell: differently from the past, it therefore becomes possible to start the game already as a more or less established manager without necessarily having to be forced to earn a reputation on the field. This addition is particularly interesting for players who intend to lead big teams, as they will be able to gain a little more trust from the management and, above all, from the fans. Concluding the parenthesis, the generation times of a new game have pleasantly turned out to be significantly reduced even compared to those of the last edition, which were already excellent in themselves, thus almost completely solving the age-old problem of the long wait for the game to be created. [C] Multiple selection via CTRL Affiliated teams Gianluigi Buffon's card [/C] Going back to the main topic of this paragraph, immediately after sitting on the bench of the chosen team, you notice some of the new features of this year: the most important is certainly the new bar at the bottom of the screen, where we no longer find only the news button, but a set of buttons through which to recall the main management sections (manager homepage, news, squad, tactics, competition, shortlisted list, training, scouts and finances), thus significantly reducing also the navigation time in the menus. It is also interesting to note that now, after pressing ~continue~, the game will automatically recall the last page displayed (especially useful for online players) and, in case of longer loading times, it will allow you to view the latest news while progressing of the bar together with some game tips, very often more than useful even for expert players. A further step forward for playability, which we have already had the opportunity to appreciate during our hands on, is identified in the possibility of making multiple selections of players within our squad, thus performing collective actions that will no longer require the hassle still having to select the players one by one despite having to select the same menu item. The coach and the media Whether Ancelotti or Seedorf like it or not, the media has now become an integral part of the football show and obviously FM has also had to adapt to this over the years. We will therefore find ourselves interviewed before a match, following a particularly dubious referee decision, we will have to respond to speculation regarding our interest in a player as well as questions from journalists on the state of form of the members of our squad: in each of these cases it will be essential to pay attention to what will be said, as the impact of our words on the team often ends up influencing its progress. In the event that you want to sign a player, it will therefore be good to try to close the negotiation soon, otherwise the other teams will find out about our interest through the media much more than in the past, trying to snatch our goal from us. Interaction with players Another new aspect concerns the interaction with the players: in addition to the possibility of publicly criticizing or praising the state of form of our team members, in any case in an improved way compared to the past and with more options, we have the possibility to ask the players of the squad any advice in terms of staff or other players to sign. Even in this case it will still be necessary to be careful, as we could have good but also bad advice, in the event that, for example, a player recommends another just for personal interest. The possibility of praising imembers of other teams after matches, as well as the ever-present comments about other coaches. The older players of our squad can also be assigned to the younger ones, acting as their mother hen and thus teaching the art of football. The spring players therefore have the opportunity to learn from the more experienced players, but it won't be all rosy: like everything in FM2007, it is in fact necessary to use a minimum of criteria, as our choices could have counterproductive effects. It will therefore be necessary to identify a minimum of similarity between the style of play of the spring and the player of the first team, paying close attention to what type of player you want to make the boy look like: to give an example, if we want an elegant defender it will be necessary to avoid Materazzi will be his mother hen, just as it will always be good to assign this role to players with a strong professionalism. Dulcis in fundo, the system of speaking to the team during the match has been improved, also adding the possibility of saying something to get the players excited before the match. Our second, if asked, will also provide us with the reactions of the locker room to our words, thus offering a valid tool for understanding whether actually with one's own words it has been possible to positively charge the environment or, vice versa, to fill it with tension. Discover talents The scouting system of the previous FMs was quite marginal, as it offered very few possibilities other than to send the observer on duty to a nation or a competition. As for the training in the previous edition (this year remained unchanged, if not for the complete division between first team and young players), this year it was therefore the observers' turn to undergo some changes: first of all, each staff member will have his own level of knowledge of the various nations, thus directing us to assign each observer within a very specific football reality. However, it will also be possible to allow scouts to increase their knowledge of an area, thus obtaining in all respects a growth system also for observers; the latter can also be assigned for a number of matches (between 1 and 3) to a player, or it will be possible to simply ask for a brief report to be compiled, in addition to the old possibility of spending time following a particular competition. Scout reports are also much more useful than in the past, with a full page of our scout ratings related to player character, strengths and weaknesses, current and potential ability, as well as any information on the contract and the possibility of transfer. The market The introduction of affiliated clubs completely overturned the FM2007 transfer system: in fact, the big team has the possibility of choosing one or more affiliates in which to grow their champions, paying their salary for the time of the loan but having the possibility to call them back if you wish. Minor teams can obviously benefit from this situation, accepting however that the team of which they become affiliates has the option on their squad, i.e. the possibility of buying players before any other team, even if an agreement is reached with other teams given the possibility to interrupt the transfer. Apart from the affiliated club system, the entire transfer market phase now appears to be much more active than in the past, perhaps even a little too much, especially as regards the big teams who often do not hesitate to deprive themselves of their champions, even if faced with a mountain of millions of euros, while it is also possible to notice some wrong valuations. By exploiting the possibility of publicly declaring one's ~love~ for a footballer, it has become possible to play psychological games to induce the player to come towards his own team, increasing his discontent towards the formation in which he plays, which once account of the player's will may be willing to surrender it. from this year, in fact, the presidents have the possibility to sell their teams to other bidders The market If by transfer market in FM2007 you thought that only players' transfers were meant, you are very wrong, since from this year, in fact, presidents have the possibility of selling their teams to other bidders, with all that follows: periods of particularly difficult transitions, possible economic blockages or recapitalizations and, unfortunately, the possibility that the new president of our team wants to bring a man he trusts to the helm, prkicking the butt of the current manager, i.e. us. You can therefore run the risk of being exonerated while not deserving the bench you are on, even if it must be said that this situation has rarely been encountered during the games played in order to write this review. The technical sector FM has never shone for sound and graphics, as it should be. While the former is also reduced to the audience during the game on this occasion, as far as the graphics are concerned, we can still make some considerations: within the 2D, the view of the players in the warm-up phase has been added and the AI improved once again , which should guarantee the absence, at least partially, of some surreal errors also present in the last edition. It's always amazing how SIGames is able to surprise their fans every year with exciting news Cross-platform The Xbox 360 version enjoys all the elements of the PC counterpart, with the addition of an interface designed specifically for the gaming experience via joypad. FM Handeld on PSP will instead be a game similar to the one covered in this review, but for obvious reasons rather reduced in content. Final comment It is always amazing how SIGames is able to surprise their fans every year with exciting news. While not free from some minor flaws and bugs, which in any case do not affect the correct running of the matches as unfortunately happened on the occasion of FM2006, the new edition of the football manager par excellence will not fail to satisfy all players, provided they fully immerse themselves in the football world reproduced almost perfectly from the game, complete with statistics and tactics for the delight of football fans from all over the world. The appointment with FM is also for this year absolutely not to be missed for any reason in the world, especially for those who every Sunday end up irrevocably ranting against the coach of their favorite team for the choices made on the pitch. Pros New observer management Reduced uploads Improved interface Dozens of new features Cons Usual bugs, but minor in nature Study and work should come before video games! The return of the king The release of Football Manager is a real ritual that is repeated every year, more or less these days: in fact, legions of football maniac gamers begin to await its appearance on the shelves more or less towards the month of August, when most of the news regarding the upcoming title leaks out, which makes the wait as spasmodic as possible. Some lucky ones participate in the beta, others await the demo version in religious silence, while still others continue to play with the previous version of FM thus exorcising the wait for the release of the new edition. To everyone's delight, after initial predictions that FM2007 would be released this coming Christmas, Sports Interactive Games and Sega have announced the release for October 20th. The king of managers has therefore returned to reclaim his throne, in direct competition with Eidos' Championship Manager, after the partnership between the latter and SIGames was interrupted a few years ago.", "date": "2006-10-20", "grade": null}
