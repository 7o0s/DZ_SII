{"name": "Ghost Squad - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-squad-recensione.html", "text": "Assault on the Wii Ghost Squad's cabinet was massive and imposing, its two assault rifles on full display. The Nintendo Wii version, for obvious reasons, is decidedly less evocative with remote controls, but to remedy this it is definitely advisable to use the same Zapper which works with both Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles and Link's Crossbow Training. Unfortunately, playing with the Wii's Light Gun is not simple and intuitive, as during the missions we will have to press the A key several times, not easily reachable if we hold the Zapper just like a machine gun. Customization is one of the keywords of this title: it is in fact possible to modify one's own appearance, but also that of the enemies, through options such as Ninja Mode and Paradise Mode, in which the opponents on the screen will all appear as ruthless Ninjas or girls in bathroom ready to take us out. The quantity of weapons is more than excellent, with 25 types of pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers, shotguns or sniper rifles. The rate of fire can also be selected, from single shot to rapid fire. The variety of options is therefore worthy of a Ghost Recon, even if the same cannot be said of the number of levels available, only three. we are in command of the Alpha team, a highly specialized team with the task of eradicating terrorists Assault on the Wii In arcade mode we are in command of the Alpha team, a highly specialized team with the task of eradicating terrorists and organized crime. In the ~Gran Villa~ scheme, our task is to rescue the President and other participants of a Summit who have been held hostage; in ~Airforce One~ we fight in the skies, aboard the presidential plane that has been hijacked, while in ~Jungle~ we are looking for Steve McCoy, CEO of a military company. The game settings are therefore only these, but it must be said that it is possible to face them in multiple ways: within the levels there are multiple paths and tactical decisions that modify the events and make us take different paths, so that to complete the 100% a pattern we have to start and finish it many times. Furthermore, the level of our character is linked to an experience score that rises as we improve our performance, and as we grow it unlocks new game modes. Going forward, in fact, the respawn of enemies changes, these increase and so does the difficulty, making Ghost Squad a varied game with a more than good longevity considering the game genre. Let's relive the golden age of arcade shooters! Ghost Squad is definitely one of the most successful Light Gun games ever. Let's finally say goodbye to the static nature that characterized the first Virtua Cops: the new SEGA title is highly dynamic, adrenaline-pumping and frenetic. Enemies pop out from every corner, hide in crevices and attack in large numbers. The camera is moved by a director clearly inspired by Hollywood action films, with the intention of making the game as exciting as possible, especially since it runs on a fixed and non-maneuverable track. Despite having a deep and very replayable arcade mode, Ghost Squad offers its maximum fun in multiplayer, up to four people at the same time, against the two of the cabinet. The game action is never monotonous and focused exclusively on shooting, but you also perform numerous side actions, such as defusing explosive devices, protecting hostages or long-range sniping. Ghost Squad offers its maximum multiplayer fun, up to four people at the same time Let's relive the golden age of arcade shooters! There is also a welcome online option via the Wi-Fi Connection, with which we can submit our scores to the international leaderboards, which are constantly updated and can be checked directly from the game. The latter is a determining factor for the longevity of the game, and partially compensates for the small amount of settings present. Ghost Squad is also a nice game to look at: it's the exact counterpart of the arcade version, surely nowadays a technical realization surpassed by the more powerful consoles, but a great sight on Nintendo Wii. The amount of polygons is enviable, offering environments full of details and details, fully destructible on-screen objects and many enemies at the same time. The animations, while always fluid, suffer from the typically SEGA 90s arcade legacy, often resulting in unrealistic and wooden. There are also some effects such as a hint of HDR for the sky, a small satisfaction for Nintendo hardware. The audio compartment is excellentmo, with music worthy of the greatest arcade classics, rhythmic military motifs and varied and well-sampled sound effects. The use of the Wii Remote is also good: numerous effects come out of the microphone which help even more with the immersion. Finally, unfortunately, the cover price should be mentioned, more than doubled in the Italian version compared to the American one. This factor certainly affects the final evaluation also because Ghost Squad is spoken entirely in English and is only subtitled in our language. Moreover, the distributed version is multilingual and not purposely localized only for the Italian territory. Comment Ghost Squad is one of the best Light Gun games ever created by SEGA. It is a well-crafted, well-crafted, frenetic and fun title. It is also a varied game, in spite of the only three schemes present, thanks to a system of multiple choices that will make us replay the same levels many times. An online ranking function has also been implemented via the Wi-Fi connection, a factor that definitely extends the life of this title, which finds its raison d'tre in multiplayer and the maximum expression of the fun it can offer. However, the price with which it is offered in our country is inexplicable, around 60 euros against 30 dollars in the USA, also considering the fact that the game has not been completely adapted. Strongly recommended to lovers of the genre, but above all to fans of the Arcade SEGA, who will relive a second youth with Ghost Squad.
