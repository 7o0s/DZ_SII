{"name": "Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-monkey-ball-banana-blitz-2.html", "text": "Brain Damage Anyone who has a minimum of familiarity with the series will have already guessed the topic we are about to address, but since it is not as well-known a brand as it deserves, it is good to inform all readers: Monkey Ball is a difficult game. Monkey Ball is a very difficult game, very difficult, it's a Hardcore Gamer game: don't be fooled by appearances, those cute and sunny stuffed monkeys are always ready to pollute your dreams. Perfidious, cheeky, with the pearl of design always lurking to make you fall off the platform (because that's how you get lost in Monkey Ball, it's the only way when time runs out), the side effects of this title are innumerable: destroyed vases, abandoning the joypad, head over to the couch, screaming and moaning in desperation for that damned platform you don't know how to tilt. All of this makes you hate the game instantly, but also love it in the long run, once you finish or solve a particularly challenging puzzle. This mentality partially clashes with the current Nintendo philosophy, inclined to attract all users to itself, including those who do not find video games very attractive. Let it roll, baby, roll Fans need not worry: not only has Monkey Ball remained the same as ever, it has also become a better game. Sega has shown that it has learned its lesson, and has created a true example of design: simple and intuitive, Banana Blitz has an almost perfect learning curve. The game contains about eighty stages, plus boss fights, which grow progressively in quality and difficulty. The first two worlds are made up of very simple levels, the platforms are often delimited by barriers so you don't fall down, the weather is always very permissive: they essentially represent a sort of tutorial to introduce the player to the use of the remote control. The Wiimote makes the experience much more rewarding and engaging, as well as more engaging, immediate and challenging Let it roll, baby, roll The Tokyo software house has amply demonstrated that it has managed to master the Wiimote perfectly: while in other third-party launch titles the controls are not in the least comparable to those offered by Nintendo games, in Monkey Ball they are precise to the millimeter. The Wiimote makes the experience much more satisfying and compelling, as well as more engaging, immediate and demanding: everyone will immediately understand how to conduct the sphere (which this time you can blow up by pressing the A button), few will be able to become skilled players. The remote control is a sort of giant and very sensitive analog stick, which however does not have an automatic central position: in GameCube games, to stop it was enough to remove the thumb from the stick, here you will have to keep still and motionless. Returning to what was mentioned before, the third world will already make you struggle a bit, and from there on it will be a continuous crescendo up to the classic internships of sixty attempts each. Compared to the past, a save system was fortunately included, a wise choice because this feature rather than making the title challenging made it frustrating. The design is therefore excellent, and the introduction of the jump has also been expertly managed; it is not difficult instead to criticize the quality of the bosses, quite fluctuating. Multi-ape Speaking of the multiplayer mode, it is a must to start by immediately mentioning a serious interface problem which unfortunately did not see Sega as the only protagonist: in fact, to add more remote controls there is no screen similar to that of Wii Sports, but you will have to synchronize them by pressing ~Home~ . It goes without saying that if you want to make life easier for those who are not used to playing this is certainly not the best way. Once you have managed to pick up more than one remote control, there will be even fifty mini-games waiting for you. The first titles in the series were characterized by the high value of the minigames rather than by their number, since each of them guaranteed hours and hours of fun. Sega hasn't been able to keep the quality high for all of Banana Blitz's minigames, but still the good ones far outnumber the bad ones. The procedure that leads to separating the most well-kept from the others is often immediate, given that the former are generally divided into further parts. For example, ~Frisbee Golf~ contains many tracks, while the simplest games run out in a matter of seconds. This analysis cannot be extended to all minigames, because there are short but extremely entertaining ones (like Squash), but it tends to be true. We cannot afford to talk about each game, we point out the best among theweight cio, the balancing path, Squash, snowboarding, fishing with pitchforks and five or six other really very nice that unfortunately it is not possible to identify with just three words; among the disappointments, unfortunately, Bowling, the regatta and every minigame containing a hovercraft must be included. In multiplayer Banana Blitz is not perfect, but it is not based only on it and despite this the quantity of minigames is enormous and the average quality is high. Sparkling primates Graphically the latter Monkey Ball is very particular, simple but cared for in every aspect. The design of the monkeys is very nice and iconoclastic, now mature without having given the slightest sign of aging, further enriched by the use of Cel Shading, perfect for the series. What matters most, however, is that the game flows quickly without missing a beat, including the absence of pop-ups. A separate discussion must be made for the sound, which is also studied to perfection and absolutely above the average: every world has well-made music and above all always suitable for the situation. Funny as usual the little voices of the monkeys, while that of the announcer is quite unnerving: his repertoire is limited to a few sentences, but some of them, above all due to the strangeness of the tone which is so reminiscent of that of the presenter of the historic ~Games without frontiers~ , will enter your head without leaving for some time (the twentieth time you hear Hello? at the beginning of the same stage you will have the impulse to bite into the Wiimote). Banana Blitz is certainly an anomalous game, just as the Monkey Ball series in general is very particular. If you're able to overlook the strangeness of the concept and (visual) design, you end up with a well-rounded, fun, long-lived and expertly developed game. The episode for Wii is certainly the best of the saga, thanks to an enormous amount of minigames - even fifty, of which at least twenty of excellent workmanship - and above all to the remote control, which works with millimeter precision and definitely improves the gaming experience. Despite the criticisms received in the last period, Sega has once again demonstrated that it knows how to create games with a mastery that few other companies possess: Banana Blitz is a jewel of game design and above all the proof that it is not only for reasons of time that many third parties have failed to achieve precise controls through the Wiimote. Pro Level Masterful single-player design Extremely precise controls Fun both alone and with friends Cons Minigame quality inconsistent Wiimotes must be synchronized from the ~Home~ The saga of rolling monkeys came to home consoles for the first time on the GameCube, thanks to the efforts of Amusement Video (also creator of F-Zero GX), better known by the simple acronym AV. The game was split into two parts, single player and multiplayer, both of which were very well done and fun. The first proposed a series of stages in which the goal was to make a sphere with a monkey inside reach the finish line, represented by an arch - don't ask yourself questions, just accept it. The peculiarity lay in the fact that with the analog stick the ball was not directed directly, but the platforms that made up the levels were inclined: changing the angle of the plane, of course, also caused the movement of the sphere. The multiplayer was instead structured in five different mini-games, some treated in a truly exceptional way (such as bowling). As you may have understood, the Wiimote seems to have been built specifically to complete the Monkey Ball experience, and Nagoshi, the creator of the series, must have thought the same thing, given this Blitz ready for launch.", "date": "2006-12-27", "grade": null}
