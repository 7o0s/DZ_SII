{"name": "Eville", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eville-recensione.html", "text": "Before the advent of Among Us, ~social deduction~ games (a term that continues to have very little sense in Italian) were mostly relegated to the field of board games, where perhaps the best variations on the theme remain, given that in video games the landscape was suddenly filled and saturated by the Innersloth title alone. However, there is room for some new interpretations, which will hardly be able to reach the degree of popularity of ~Amogus~ but which certainly has something to say to those who want to try something a little different starting from the same basic theme, such as we see in this review of Eville. In fact, the VestGames game tries a sort of mediation between the complexity of some board games and the immediacy of Among Us, only partially succeeding in such a difficult intent but having the merit of propose something much more structured than the various clones of the Innersloth title. The medieval setting probably recalls Lupus in Tabula, progenitor of this genre, but the way in which the various characteristics come together in a composite whole is certainly original. The structure is much more complex than one might think looking at the new trends of ~social deduction games~, but the fundamental element always remains the interaction with other players, so it is essential, also in this case, to deal with a group of users who play the game in a correct and stimulating way. The ideal is always to play with known people, because unfortunately the random composition of the teams can often lead to dealing with more or less toxic users with whom it is difficult to set up a satisfactory game. Crimes and misdeeds in a quiet village Eville, the setting is medieval and fairy-tale Being a game of social deduction, it is again an asymmetric multiplayer in which one group of players must guard against the constant covert attacks of another group of players, in a fight between ~good guys~ and ~bad guys~. All this takes place in a particular setting, really pleasant and perfectly functional for such a game: in Eville we find ourselves in a small and charming medieval village, with architectures that could be Bavarian or Alsatian, in a climate that recalls the old Fable. Also in this case, a part of the players plays normal inhabitants, while a smaller group operates in the role of the ~bad guys~: the purpose of the latter is to sow panic and terror by killing the first ones, while the others must try to live a life relatively quiet making sure to place defenses to avoid attacks. Unlike Among Us, a game of Eville can extend considerably, structuring itself through a tight day / night cycle, which marks the possible activities of one group and the other, with various quests and activities that can be performed in the light of the sun and crimes which usually take place at night. Each inhabitant has his own house, and basically spends most of the time he is awake trying to establish defenses to avoid being killed during the night, while the villains plan their actions during the day wicked to do with the favor of darkness. This scanning between day and night already requires a certain strategic setting, because it builds sorts of macro-shifts in which to organize the activities to be carried out, structuring the actions in a much more profound and complex way which, in other similar titles, take place in a much more spontaneous and less reasoned. Eville, a moment of interaction between players in the square For those who appreciate a slower and more cadenced pace, also interspersed with real quests that actually don't really make much sense, this interpretation of the social deduction mechanics could be ideal, as long as you are dealing with the right group of players given that interaction, collaboration and deception still remain the pillars on which the whole game is based. Even the most typical moments of the genre remain, with direct confrontation between the players: once a corpse, it is possible to draw everyone's attention and start the usual impromptu trial of the possible culprit, starting the usual whirlwind of mutual accusations and lies to avoid the gallows. Also in this case, the faction that manages to eliminate the opponents without ending up decimated on the scaffold wins. Roles and specializations Eville, each character has a role and distinctive characteristics In addition to the time scan and the complex setting, a strong distinguishing element of Eville is the fact that each character that can be assignedati has its own role and has specific characteristics. This gives everything a further level of strategy, also proposing continuous variations to the gameplay because each class is able to perform specific actions, behave in a certain way and exploit peculiar skills to achieve their goal. The villagers are divided into 7 categories: citizen, trap specialist, guard, mayor, seer, medium and detective, while the villains specialize in four roles, namely barbarian, thief, defamator and smuggler. Each character, in this way, has its own specific role, with skills that allow different interactions with other players and with the surrounding environment. It is an element of great importance because it substantially modifies the gameplay according to the role that comes to us assigned, far beyond the simple distinction between good and bad. In playing Eville we find a significant amount of activities to carry out, between quests and rewards that allow us to obtain the tools necessary for our purposes, which is essentially to kill or avoid being killed, especially during the night. Eville allows various side activities during the day However, the specializations introduce several fundamental variations to the gameplay, in some cases also exploiting a real crafting system starting from the resources conquered with the quests and purchased in the shops of the town: the trap specialist, for example, can build various defensive systems to cage or slow down the enemies, the seer can set up barriers and security systems to see any break-ins in the players' homes, the barbarian can use his strength to chase and kill quickly even during the day, mediums and detectives have additional possibilities to collect information and discover the culprits. Each class has a role that fits precisely into the game mechanism, even if in the end what matters is always the group's ability to play according to the rules and with the right identification, because in the end the game of social deduction is essentially a role-playing game set on a standard canvas, which can also be tiring in the long run. A fairy tale with disturbing implications Eville, a nocturnal meeting There is no doubt that the technical realization of Eville, although always in the wake of modest-sized indie productions, brings a new dimension to this type of game, hitherto limited to far more stylized and elementary representations. It might seem like an accessory element, but in this case the full 3D and finely modeled world still has an important purpose: the movement of the characters becomes more realistic, their presence is more physical and the landscape plays an active part in the game of concealment and research. In short, these are not simple aesthetic and marginal embellishments: the transition to a three-dimensional world has important effects in the very way of playing this type of game, also becoming essential for the gameplay. Whether or not this represents an effective evolution on the standard action of an Among Us is another matter, and as far as we are concerned we have several doubts about it, but it is not clear that the graphic solution adopted is designed to work with a certain structure of game. Furthermore, it does not hurt that the aesthetic characterization is still pleasant. The general atmosphere is reminiscent of a sort of parody of medieval fantasy and the first example that comes to mind is certainly the aforementioned Fable, with due proportions. Obviously this is not a particularly complex and rich system, on the contrary it appears rather rough and simplistic in many respects, in particular as regards the animations of the characters, particularly woody and poorly integrated with the surrounding environment. There are also some technical drawbacks related to texture loading, which is often delayed, holding models and even extremely low resolution 2D images for a few seconds before receiving the right treatment. One dubious element in the general organization of Eville is the presence of a sort of Battle Pass: the game is distributed as a premium, i.e. with a purchase price that is not even low compared to the standards of the genre, amounting to 14.99 euros, however this only represents the ~entrance tickets~ . By playing it is possible to unlock various bonuses by advancing in the Battle Pass, or you can obtain particularly rare items by purchasing them through micro-transactions and activating the paid Pass. While this doesn't seem to affect the balance of the game through pay to win practices, it's definitely an addition we would have gladly done without.", "date": "2022-11-10", "grade": "7.2"}
