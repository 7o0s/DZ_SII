The maneuver is not perfect, and so the artifact ends up in pieces. An accident that could cost dearly: the tablet possessed supernatural properties, hand in glove with the very fabric of reality, and its breaking resulted in dimensional ~tears~ that expose the entire planet to enormous risks. Telepathically contacted by Madame Web, Spidey learns of the existence of at least two other versions of himself, ~twins~ belonging to different eras (one lives in the past, the other in the future) with whom he must collaborate to prevent Mysterio from be the first to find the fragments of the tablet, scattered in the three dimensions. Slightly modified in the plot and with a version of Spider-Man missing from the appeal (the one belonging to the Ultimate universe, difficult to fit into a structure of this type), Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions also arrives on Nintendo DS with a portable reduction based on the already discreet The Kingdom of Shadows, also edited by Griptonite Games. The gameplay of the two titles is in fact extremely similar, with Spider-Man who can use his web to ~swing~ from one building to another but also to face his opponents, gradually more cunning and numerous. There are two substantial differences: the first is that in Shattered Dimensions we will have to deal with three versions of Spider-Man, each equipped with peculiar abilities that only from a certain point in the story onwards will they begin to ~match~, allowing us to reach previously inaccessible; the second consists of the presence of much more classic boss fights, moments in which our little spider will have to deal with very resistant enemies or who in any case require a particular strategy to be defeated. To these two elements is added a technical realization that appears improved from every point of view, in particular as regards the scenarios, which change according to the ~dimension~ but always remain very detailed and endowed with a depth that is rare to find on a Nintendo DS. Past, present and future As mentioned above, in the game we will find ourselves controlling the Spider-Man that we all know but also his ~noir~ version belonging to the past and the Spider-Man of 2099. Each of these variants initially presents itself with advantages and disadvantages compared to the other Spidey: Past Spider-Man cannot stick to walls but possesses the ability to sense the presence of hidden objects in the environment; 2099 Spider-Man cannot web swing but can spread his wings and glide to cover long distances in flight; finally, the current Spider-Man, while possessing most of the characteristic powers of the character, does not have the extra abilities of his ~brothers~. By interacting with each other throughout the story, the three superheroes who are so similar but so different will end up ~synchronizing~ their powers and will therefore be able to complete the exploration of the levels to find the fragments of the magic tablet. The exploratory phase of each ~era~ sees the presence of numerous opponents to face, but the combat system of the game leaves something to be desired at first and returns the idea of simplistic gameplay, with few moves available and an AI which leaves something to be desired. Fortunately, things change after a while, the maneuvers available to us multiply and at the same time the enemies become more cunning, varied and resistant, often introducing firearms and shields within the physical confrontation. The boss fights themselves on more than one occasion prove to be complex enough to put us in serious difficulty, and sometimes require a couple of attempts to be completed successfully. We have already talked about the technical sector: the graphics are excellent in terms of detail, design, animations and general fluidity, showing the side to some slowdown only during the most agitated phases; the sound is a bit weak in effects, but it makes up for it thanks to excellent music and rich English speech (with Italian subtitles).", "date": "2010-10-13", "grade": "7.7"}
