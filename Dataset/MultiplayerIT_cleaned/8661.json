{"name": "Gli anelli del caos", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100819-chaos-rings-ii-gli-anelli-del-chaos.html", "text": "The world is in danger (check), an ancient force has awakened and is about to destroy it (check); and so the young Darwin, an orphan (check) who became a mercenary, discovers that he is the chosen one (check), that is the one who will have to complete an ancient rite (check) capable of sealing evil again. Chaos Rings II, let's face it right away, is both in narrative terms and in purely playful terms, as an extremely classic product (we don't want to say ~already seen a million times~), with which JRPG enthusiasts will feel practically at home from the first moment. It is also true that certain formulas, although repeated endlessly, retain their charm and remain capable of bewitching us, despite some objective limitations which, however, are accompanied by equally indisputable strengths. In this specific case, the product developed by Media.Vision substantially enriches and optimizes the experience of the first two episodes, giving us a game that would look good on a new generation portable console and whose sale price on the App Store (14 49 euros for the iPhone version, 15.99 euros for the iPad version) is therefore well below the figures that fans of the genre usually pay out for the same duration, content and quality. We were saying, the plot has little to do with the first Chaos Rings and its prequel, Chaos Rings Omega, and sees the young Darwin find himself in the middle of a situation much bigger than him, which will force him to grow a lot in haste and to take on absurdly serious responsibilities, on which the salvation or destruction of the planet will depend. In the early stages of the game we see him intent, together with his partner and mentor Orlando, to resist the sudden attack of demonic creatures after the world has practically ~stopped~. The two characters are mysteriously transported to an undefined place, where an unknown force takes control of Darwin and forces him to kill Orlando, sealing his spirit in one of the five ~pillars~ that will serve to defeat the terrible Neron. This phase is told a little hastily and perhaps would have needed a few more minutes, but the plot of Chaos Rings II at that point takes off and conquers, stereotypes or not. Connor, you've been nominated A mysterious gentleman walking in mid-air (his first entrance is truly fascinating, with the sound of distant footsteps), accompanied by a huge herald, reveals himself to Darwin and tells him that he has been chosen to fill the role of ~ Nominator~, and having to sacrifice for the salvation of the world four other people in addition to the aforementioned Orlando: Araki, a skilled samurai; Li Hua, a martial arts expert; Connor, a boy from a noble family, good at shooting with a crossbow; Marie, Orlando's sister as well as the protagonist's great (unconfessed, check) love. Everyone will have to fall under Darwin's sword; only the order of the sacrifices will change, which will not only put us in difficulty from an ethical point of view but will also force us to make decisions that go against our own interests (such as that of first sacrificing Araki, the most ~ready~ but also the strongest of the group). Each choice will considerably influence the portion of the adventure that we will be able to play by forming a party with another character, showing us different scenarios and situations and then ending with a final phase which is also different depending on the direction taken (a handy ~scheme~ on the screen starting point shows us the possible ramifications). The duration of the experience will multiply in various ways, in short, requiring literally dozens of hours to complete the game 100%. All facets of great value which, however, unfortunately, are not reflected in the structure of the missions, which simply sees us explore each new unlocked scenario in search of one of the elements necessary for the ritual, facing in the meantime a myriad of random fights which on the one hand they are fundamental to adequately level up the characters and prepare them for boss battles, on the other hand they are the legacy of a way of making JRPGs that focuses on such expedients to forcefully lengthen longevity, also considering that most of the animations cannot be skipped. The turn-based combat system, with the possibility of carrying out attacks in pairs (and both undergoing a possible counterattack) or alone, as well as using magic (~sopia~), objects and special attacks (~awake~, to be loaded) it makes very few changes to the formula we know well. As in other JRPGs, however, there is the defect of enemies that are too strong to be beaten at the first encounter, which forces us (after the defeat) and wander around like a fool in the scenario to carry out some other random combat in order to reach a higher level of experience. At least it doesn't appear very marked, it could have been worse. Nothing to say, however, for the technical sector. The graphics, thanks to the Retina Display, are excellent during the fights and very convincing even in the cutscenes, thanks to detailed and well-characterized polygonal models. The scenarios also reserve some glimpses worthy of note, even if the exploration level is minimal and the map (which can be recalled at any time) is barely interpretable. As for the sound, the music is extremely evocative and well done, but above all the interpretation of the dialogues is in line with the best Japanese productions (as they know how to shout...). By the way, the voices are in Japanese and it's not possible to listen to them in English (it's better this way, go), while the lyrics are all in English and therefore the Italian translation is missing. Too bad, but there is a reason for it.", "date": "2012-03-21", "grade": "9.2"}
