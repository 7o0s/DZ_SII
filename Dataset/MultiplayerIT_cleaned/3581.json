The television show of the Tour de France and other competitions is in fact undeniable, and manages to attract players who are passionate about this sport even in the videogame field, like every year linked to Pro Cycling Manager 2019 by Cyanide Studio. In fact, the Pro Cycling Manager series has existed since 2001 and does not seem to have any intention of giving up before it can celebrate its twentieth birthday. Indeed, for the occasion, the French team presents a new distribution agreement with Bigben Interactive, the effects of which can perhaps be seen in the coming years. As far as this edition is concerned, in fact everything remains similar to how we already knew it: Pro Cycling Manager 2019 arrives in the hottest period of the season, with the Giro d'Italia just archived and the transalpine race now in full swing, accompanied by the usual Tour de France 2019. For those who do not know the latter, we remind you that it is a version of the game in arcade sauce, exclusive console (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One). On PC, however, we can enjoy Pro Cycling Manager 2019 as always and all its managerial experience, supported for some years by the interesting Pro Cyclist mode. If on paper it seems to change very little compared to what we saw a year ago, at the end of this review you will have the confirmation that this is exactly the case, even if fortunately there are some small changes. Let's go see what it is. The modalities: cyclist or manager? Beyond the simple races, the heart of the Pro Cycling Manager 2019 game experience is divided between the classic management mode, in which we take care of an entire team, and the aforementioned Pro Cyclist, in which we are instead called to create a our cyclist to get him to the Olympus of two-wheeled competitions. Let's start from the latter, to say that conceptually it hasn't changed much compared to the formula with which it debuted a few years ago: after having given an identity to one's character on the threshold of twenty years, it is necessary to choose his qualities among a series of well-known types, including climber, sprinter and so on. At the beginning, you also choose the team you want to join to start competing, bearing in mind that the more famous the team you choose, the less chance you have of showing off. Conversely, in a secondary team it soon becomes possible to aspire to prominent positions. The real novelty of this year for the Pro Cyclist mode lies in the introduction of a skill system similar to that of an RPG (with due proportions), within which to attribute the points we get by leveling up in twelve different aspects, related to personality and charisma, athletic skills or behavior in competition. This is undoubtedly an interesting addition, above all in light of the fact that this modality largely remains similar to the one seen last year: by listening to the leaders during the race, positive evaluations are obtained, thus improving in quality by increasing the character level. Very similar to the Pro Cyclist is the classic Career, where as manager we have to take care of the entire team. The menus of the two modes are in fact quite similar to each other to the point that there is little difficulty in switching from one to the other, even if obviously in the Career it is necessary to lose a few more minutes to prepare training and competitions, trying to get ready to each appointment with the best group and the best form possible. In this case, the main innovations concern the introduction of some additional element to attract the attention of the cyclists that interest us, making it easier to start discussions with them to close contracts with our team. As for the rest, we obviously don't want to forget the multiplayer mode of Pro Cycling Manager 2019, however limited to the organization of tournaments for a number of players that can reach up to sixteen. Given that the Armada mode (similar to FIFA's Ultimate Team) has now been archived for years it perhaps no longer makes sense to complain about its absence, but we still think that we would have liked to see some additional effort from Cyanide in this regard . In competition Even if in our opinion we still have to wait a few moments too long, the loading of the stages has been made a little lighter than in previous years. Once it's time to start pedalling, you realize how similar everything is to what we saw in Pro Cycling Manager 2018, practically identical if you excludemo optimization of the game interface. The level of graphics has remained practically the same, and if we are offered a good chance of obtaining a suggestive glance from the top view, moving the camera close up we notice the same defects found in previous editions. The animations of the cyclists can in fact still be improved, just as the presence of semi-immobile and repetitive spectators on the roadside in 2019 is starting to feel decidedly tight. The technical aspect of Pro Cycling Manager 2019 is therefore the one that inevitably suffers the most from the aging of this series, to which we hope that Cyanide can give a generational change in the next chapter. Beyond the graphic and sound elements, which are also the same as last year, once we hit the road we have the opportunity to give our cyclists (or our cyclist, in the case of the Pro Cyclist) orders on how to behave during the race, remaining in position or trying to attack, up to tasks usually reserved for supporters such as protection (which, however, does not quite work, at least visually) and water supply. The AI continues to enjoy the work done in the last couple of years, where the developers have made the CPU-controlled cyclists more combative in case you try to attack, going in turn to try to escape with cognition. Problems arise when you get stuck in the group due to a climb or other elements that compact it: getting out of it becomes really frustrating and difficult, with the consequent loss of precious moments. Even if bug reports on which the developers are working continue to be read on the forums, the current version of Pro Cycling Manager 2019 should at least be free of the major problems encountered shortly after day-one.", "date": "2019-07-23", "grade": "6.2"}
