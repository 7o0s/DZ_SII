{"name": "Cartoni in fuga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/143014-looney-tunes-dash-cartoni-in-fuga.html", "text": "There are basically two types of endless runners: horizontal scrolling ones, like Jetpack Joyride, and third-person ones, like Temple Run. Looney Tunes Dash!, Zynga's latest effort for iOS and Android devices, belongs to the second category and uses the characters of the famous Warner Bros. cartoons to catapult us into the typical settings of these productions, in the role of Bugs Bunny, Beep Beep, Tweety and Duffy Duck, each pursued by their nemesis. Each ~episode~ corresponds to a protagonist, but not only: the scenarios change, the dangers to be faced change and the missions change, an element that constitutes a rather important novelty compared to the traditional connotation of endless titles. In fact, we don't need to run endlessly, trying to reach the greatest possible distance in each game, with a view to attempts for their own sake; but to complete specific objectives from time to time and reach the finish line, and then move on to the next stage by referring to a map that is very reminiscent of that of King's various ~Saga~. Likewise, the levels are not generated randomly but remain the same with each new attempt, which means that you have to memorize their characteristics, the arrangement of objects and traps where you have difficulties and need to make further attempts to finish the race successfully. The freemium mechanisms of this production are clearly manifested precisely in these situations: at each game over one of the five default lives is consumed, which are recharged every ten minutes, while to continue a suddenly interrupted game you have to spend a little of hard currency, obtainable exclusively by paying real money or, albeit in small quantities, by watching advertising videos. Looney Tunes Dash! it's a well done title, with some interesting new features, but it's still an endless runner That's it, folks! More than the experience of Temple Run, known for a degree of challenge that suddenly increases and for the lack of an effective progression, Looney Tunes Dash! it rather refers to Subway Surfers, a variation on the theme that uses exclusively touch controls and divides the path into three ~lanes~, on which to move by making slides on the screen. It is a much more precise and permissive approach, characterized by a speed that is anything but prohibitive, a mild pace that allows you to complete the first episodes without major difficulties (apart from a few isolated cases) and therefore enjoy everything that the scenarios have to offer. From a technical point of view, in fact, the game is a great sight for the eyes, thanks to a faithful and effective realization of the Warner Bros. characters, as well as the locations in which they move. There is no shortage of surprise appearances, with various ~cameos~ to make things even more exciting, see for example the alien who appears in the sky during missions with Beep Beep to throw his subordinates at us, who are also to be avoided. As for the objectives, in some cases it is simply a question of reaching the finish line, in others of collecting a certain amount of certain objects, and reaching the end of the race without having succeeded invariably translates into game over. There is certainly an increase in difficulty in favor of microtransactions, and the phenomenon is already felt at the end of the first episode, the one with Bugs Bunny, but the fact remains that with a little effort and patience it is actually possible to complete the campaign without huge problems. More like cutting Looney Tunes Dash's legs a bit! it is precisely its nature as an endless runner: despite the undeniable innovations with respect to the tradition of the genre, there is no doubt that those who have already spent dozens of hours with the various Temple Runs will be reluctant to do the same again, albeit with a title quite different on paper.", "date": "2015-01-03", "grade": "7.3"}
