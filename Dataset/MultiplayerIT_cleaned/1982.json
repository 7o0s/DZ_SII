{"name": "Ballerburg", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ballerburg.html", "text": "The Walls of Jericho... yes oh well... In case you haven't figured it out yet, I repeat that the fulcrum (in every sense) of the entire game is your own castle, which you will have to strenuously defend against enemy attacks using only your own artillery, given that there is absolutely no armies to which stratego- maniacs are used to it. Ballerburg, entirely in 3D, offers us a broad overview of our manor, an overview that can be modified by orienting the camera as we like best: it will in fact be possible to rotate and zoom the view along an entire hypothetical hemisphere whose center of rotation is always the main building of the palace, where our good castellan resides (a beautiful lady to tell the truth, but don't get upset, it seems that an ugly bald guy with a mustache is already trying while you toil to defend the barrack). The management of our kingdom is somewhat simplified: build basic buildings such as farms and warehouses, from which to draw a periodic income from which to draw for research, construction and (sigh) the launch of every single artillery shot. Once the building has been chosen, it will be placed where preferred and it will be seen emerging from the ground as if by magic. Soon it will be appropriate to fortify our domain with high walls and towers on which to install cannons. We will then proceed to raise advanced buildings such as the blacksmith or the ~Superbrain~, which will allow us to research higher level weapons and structural upgrades. If by chance the buildings or weapons are damaged, it is possible to donate part of the funds for self-repair: it will be up to us to decide to what extent. Everything is therefore extremely direct and intuitive even for the less accustomed to this aspect of the strategic game. And so it must be, because the aspect on which we will have to concentrate is taking a mazzat ... pardon, cannon fire on the gums with the amiable neighbors. What a Cannonade! If the only way we have to face the enemy is to fight him with artillery blows, it will be necessary to have a worthy arsenal, and so it will be, once we have developed our modest castle into an impregnable fortress with all the necessary infrastructures. As we have surrounded ourselves with special buildings and have carried out the most appropriate research, we will see ourselves enable new offensive machinery or upgrade the ones we already have to a more effective and lethal version. We will also be able to research support 'updates', such as greater shooting accuracy, more resistant defensive walls, or magical shields against enemy attacks. The basic arsenal will usually consist of a catapult and a cannon. In addition to the obvious difference in shooting mechanics, keep in mind that the first will be mounted on the ground, with more freedom, while the second must necessarily be on a tower of your walls, so you will have a limited number. However, there are several enhanced variants of these two simple weapons, including those that launch flaming projectiles. For example, the Long John is a catapult that shoots three boulders at once, while there are double-barreled variants of the cannon, or heavy cannons that launch explosive projectiles, or the infamous Ballistae (ubiquitous in many classic strategic games): huge crossbows that they throw long logs transformed into projectiles. At advanced levels you'll get your hands on artillery pieces with bizarre names like Fat Helga and Hot Freda, real rocket launchers with rudimentary explosive missiles and even a zeppelin capable of flying up to the enemy castle to drop devastating shells on it. Furthermore, for each of the four queens that you will serve there will be different Elite weapons to use: I leave it up to you to find out which ones ... The fire system is as simple as it is realistic: with the appropriate arrows you orient the direction in which to shoot and adjust the I raise, then press a nice red button to fire. A tracking view shows us the trail of the bullet and the point of impact, in order to correct the next shot and, believe me, many adjustments are made, also because, in addition to the realistic imprecision of the weapons of that era, there it will also be the wind effect that will give us a hard time. We can also add that the coming of night will make things a little more complicated for us; how do you say? Yes at night! In fact, if you look at the details, you will notice that there is a really well done day-night cycle, with clouds, stars, sunsets and sunrises, and many little lights that light up in the houses. To tell the truth, it seemed like a cheap game to you, but many aspects have been taken care of that undoubtedly embellish it. A pinch of magic, just for gradire Even magic, now inevitable in a medieval game of this type, will play its role, certainly not predominant, but still useful for achieving the final victory. The starting point will be the construction of the Magician's Tower, in which a sort of Papa Smurf's crazy brother will research new spells in order to expand the list of magic tricks at your disposal, which essentially fall into two categories: those that on your castle and those that the wizard himself will launch against enemy outposts. Like firearms, using magic will also require a reload time, which is quite long, as well as some gold expenditure. If initially the possibility of using magic could be irrelevant, in the more advanced maps of the single player campaign or in the excited phases of a clash with multiple players, it will be of undoubted advantage to have some tricks up your sleeve: a magical rain that puts out the flames set from incendiary shells to our structures; a blanket of fog that makes it difficult for enemy men-at-arms to aim; a toxic cloud that infects enemy villagers with debilitating plagues; lightning that strikes the buildings of the unfortunate rival. These and other amazing spells, combined with the action of the various weapons, will make the difference between victory and defeat. Castlemen of the world unite! If looking at the screenshots you are imagining how much fun it must be to shoot the A.I. of the game try to think big: Ballerburg allows you to extend its epic challenges also in multiplayer mode. Not only is it possible to set up two or more different profiles on the same PC in order to play in turns with friends (reminiscent of the old games of the past: today if you notice it is very rare to be able to play multiplayer on the same machine unless be it NBA/NHL/FIFA200x), but you can try your hand at the classic session via LAN, which supports up to four players. The same maximum number of players is supported by the online game via TCP/IP by connecting with the appropriate Ascaron client, which requires the creation of an account on their site. Whatever type of mode you choose, you will still have many parameters with which to set up your game, starting with the four modes: Quickgame, Action, Strategy, Tactics, which offer different degrees of difficulty and complexity: in the simplest you will have fully developed castles with all the advanced weapons and bullets at no cost, in the most difficult you will start from the basics to slowly expand. You can also create a custom type of game according to your taste. What to say ? There is something for everyone I think. It's not just a matter of Cannons Technically speaking, the requirements of the game are within everyone's reach. During the installation phase, three different alternatives will be proposed based on typical configurations from which to choose the one closest to your system. Ballerburg runs on all Microsoft OSes, from Windows 95 onwards (NT excluded), and requires at least a Pentium II/350 class processor and 64 Mb of RAM, with a video card with at least 16 Mb of RAM. The requirements recommended by the distributor include a similar configuration but with a CPU frequency of at least 450 Mhz. The installation occupies about 600 Mb. It is therefore a very accessible game and moreover also well packaged if you think of the limited budget and the idea on which it is based; the graphics and sound are good and with attention to detail, especially the soundtrack, with such epic tones that contrast with the funny and ironic setting. The scenarios, not very varied, include four types of environments with different maps to choose from: Forest, Desert, Volcanic and Arctic, plus special maps called ~Alien~. Landscapes range from wide valleys or frozen wastes to high peaks or winding canyons on whose summits warring castles tower imperiously. Perhaps a little more variety could have been added, but it is said that additional maps will not be released... Shall we play? Needless to say, strategy purists will turn up their noses. Some may flee to the cry of ~go retro!~, but if you put aside the excessive fanaticism and the desire to see ever more complex titles, I think you can appreciate Ballerburg for what it is: a fun game. The simple but atypical concept, the immediacy in the management of game tactics, the approach that is not too serious or dramaticthey certainly make it fun. Of course, the longevity does not seem to be excessively high given the repetitiveness that occurs after a while, but in many advanced missions the persistence on a particular objective and the ~Quaker-strategist syndrome ~ will take over making you forget about the passing of time between catapult reloads. Not unmissable, of course, but definitely worth trying. Smurfs here, smurfs there It's the new frontier of strategy games, it's a revolution in the gaming world, it's disruptive, it's ... Ballerburg! OK let's put the epic trailer aside and put things back into perspective with one clear premise: This is NOT a serious game. The orcs and elves have gone on vacation, the aliens have decided not to take over our world, and the hosts of mounted armieswell, they had better things to do. Only funny squires with big noses passed through the convent (yes, it has nothing to do with the title but they remind me a lot of the Smurfs) and awkward movements, who among other things don't want to leave the fortified walls to defend the lands of their ruler. So what is left for the poor castellan on duty to defend himself from enemies and in the meantime kill time? Easy: a large series of firearms with which to bombard the hateful neighbor, who happens to be equipped in the same way and ready to make us tit for tat. From these premises, a duel with cannon fire can only arise to decide who will be left standing last, making use of all that technology can offer to the castellan mentioned above in terms of firepower.", "date": "2002-10-11", "grade": null}
