In this 2022 there has been no shortage of titles that have made the creation of curative (and other) concoctions their main mechanics: this is the case of Strange Horticulture - which has several elements in common with what we will analyze today - and Potion Permit, focused on life of a pharmacist. After more than a year of early access, Potion Craft is added to the ranks, all based on the figure and the difficult path of an alchemist in a fantasy world with medieval overtones. It is a particular universe, in which the ingredients lead us to the discovery of new effects for our potions, tracing a path on different alchemical maps depending on the base used. The alchemist's workshop is a place of research and creation, but also of commerce and meeting: the management of relationships with customers and merchants is, not surprisingly, a central aspect in Potion Craft. We talk about it in depth in our review of Potion Craft. A budding alchemist The most disparate characters will go to our workshop. Merchants are of fundamental importance in Potion Craft, as they allow us to get the ingredients needed for our potions The adventure begins with the main character settling in an old shack. The presence of old alchemical equipment, now ruined, makes us understand that once upon a time that place was the seat of an alchemist's workshop. Perfect: our intention is precisely to take the same path. Potion Craft wants us to immerse ourselves in the complex path of a novice scholar, and the very short tutorial - which only gives us the basics, without disclosing all the secrets of the art - is perfect for instilling curiosity and, at the same time, making us understand that c 'that's really a lot of work to do. Because alchemy, an art that combines physics, chemistry, philosophy, astrology, metallurgy and botany, needs a lot of study. Bookish? No, we are talking about a more practical approach. The need to learn by doing is symbolized by the alchemical map itself, in which we will move through our ingredients. That's right: in Potion Craft the alchemist doesn't even put his nose out of his shop, but moves continuously on the path of his knowledge. On the map we will find book-shaped counters scattered, essential for leveling up and unlocking new skills at a commercial level (getting better prices from customers and merchants) or alchemical (by opening up a greater portion of the map). It is also important to follow the steps indicated in our book, which traces a sort of virtuous path in indicating tasks to be carried out and potions to be created: divided into chapters, it will mark our progress in the difficult art of alchemy. We soon discover that the question marks on the map hide effects - positive or negative - that our potions can take on, and which in many cases can even be combined. But be careful, because we must always keep an eye on the entrepreneurial side of our business: it will be very difficult to find a buyer for a potion that gives a bonus to speed, but at the same time also has the effect of a deadly poison... One of the first goals in Potion Craft is to restore the old alchemical equipment of the shop to its former glory. Once the desired path has been completed by adding the correct ingredients and mixing our cauldron, the bellows will be used to attribute the effect to the potion and, when desired, conclude the procedure. Mortar and pestle are essential accessories, as the path of the ingredients also depends on their processing: the more they are minced, the farther they will go. This is not always a good thing, and it takes a steady hand and a sharp brain to move along an often bumpy path, given the presence of areas of the map which, if touched, will ruin our potion. The idea of allowing a wide customization of bottles, labels, names and symbols with which to distinguish our potions is very pleasant, thus feeling the whole process as authentically ours. Potions for everyone Among Potion Craft's customers there are some who wink at famous videogame sagas. We mentioned the entrepreneurial aspects of our business, which lives in the balance between two opposing needs: on the one hand, the boundless curiosity of the alchemist (and of the player) to discover new portions of the map and new effects for his potions; on the other, the need to manage one's resources carefully, especially money. The ingredients aren't cheap - and indeed, the makers of Potion Craft set out todouble the price when the game comes out of early access - and the merchants don't visit the shop every day: as they did centuries ago, these are itinerant figures and with a variable assortment, with significant price fluctuations. What is found today may not be found tomorrow (or in a week!), or may have an exaggerated and not convenient cost. We considered the management of the probabilities of merchants passing through the shop to be correct, never finding ourselves in situations of dramatic shortage of ingredients. What will never be lacking are customers - if we know how to make a good name for ourselves, of course. Attention, ~good~ does not necessarily mean ~respectable~: characters of all types will come to us, some simply eager for a tonic tonic, some engaged in disturbing rituals of necromancy. Satisfying the various requests will have an impact on our reputation, influencing the type of customers who will turn to us for our services. Thus, if we find ourselves meeting the demand for poisonous potions often, we will have more and more customers with not exactly recommendable inclinations. This is an interesting addition that allows for a certain roleplay, but it is also possible to change the approach during construction, systematically refusing all requests that are not to our liking. However, we must be careful not to completely alienate the sympathy of the public, which ultimately provides us with the resources necessary to continue in what really interests us: the initiatory path of the alchemist. Curious that requests are never linear. Nobody will purely and simply ask us to prepare him a potion of strength: the customer will present a certain situation (~I have to collect plants on a very high mountain~, ~I want to get rid of my husband's lover~ and other far more bizarre ones) and he will be it's up to us to find the right solution, perhaps negotiating with a small mini-game to raise the price. For convenience, we will be able to save our most successful potions in the recipe book, initially consisting of a few pages, but which can be purchased in large quantities from a special merchant. Potion Craft's alchemical map is intuitive to navigate, but you need to be very careful about the path you choose Honorable mention for the aesthetic rendering of the ingredients: vegetables, mushrooms and metals are all immediately recognizable and well characterized, with great differences in terms of the effects and the path that they will make us carry out on the alchemical map. Just like in Strange Horticulture, it is essential to know their effects in depth in order to achieve your goals. On an aesthetic level, we found several references to the 15th century Voynich Manuscript, never deciphered and full of illustrations of mysterious plants. In short, Potion Craft is a feast for the eyes (and for the ears, with a pleasant and never invasive musical accompaniment), and the daily collection of plants and mushrooms in the Enchanted Garden always gives satisfaction and surprises. From lead to gold The bargaining phase allows the price proposed by the merchants to be lowered and the price requested by the alchemist to be increased from his customers In addition to selling potions and discovering the alchemical map, we will soon realize that we can repair - always with the help of our trusted merchants - the old stills that belonged to our predecessor. This opens up a world of great complexity that will lead us to the true purpose of the adventure: to create the Great Work, the culmination of the alchemical itinerary, following the steps of nigredo, albedo, citrinitas and, finally, rubedo. This is no small feat: the great power of the potions required to power the machinery means that you need to know the ingredients and alchemical map perfectly, since high-level creations require study and attention to complete.The introduction of new customers, new requests, new merchant missions, new ingredients and new maps in version 1.0 of Potion Craft certainly contributes to making the process less tedious, even if at times there is a certain underlying repetitiveness: the days of the alchemist they are indeed marked by progress and new discoveries, but the fundamental gameplay mechanics remain the same throughout the adventure. Potion Craft is able to keep you glued to the screen for more than twenty hours, even if the duration of the alchemical path will strongly depend on the skills (and luck, in some cases) of each player. The Italian translation is impeccable, which allows a full understanding of the effects of the ingredients and customer requests.", "date": "2022-12-19", "grade": "8.5"}
