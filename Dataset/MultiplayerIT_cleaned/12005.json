{"name": "Jump Free Running", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jump-free-running.html", "text": "In fact, Jump Free Running puts the user in the role of a free runner with a genuine civic sense, who undertakes to solve a whole series of problems by running on the roofs, jumping into the void and various stunts. Simply called Urban Hero, our protagonist is divided between San Francisco, London and Cairo, over the course of 18 levels all characterized by a small or large crisis to solve. We will therefore find ourselves having to restore energy in a neighborhood shaken by an earthquake, to turn on the alarms of a building in the grip of thieves or even to activate water pumps to extinguish the fire in a skyscraper, and so on. . The game action therefore takes place entirely between roofs, cornices and spandrels, framed by a fairly comfortable and functional isometric view. Basically, the gameplay of Jump Free Running consists in pressing the key indicated on the screen at the right time, in order to perform the required stunt with timing and precision, thus accumulating a greater number of points: every time you approach to a sensitive point, a yellow indicator appears in the lower part of the display, with an arrow that runs through it and which must be stopped in the central area of the same (in a way not unlike the systems used in golf games, so to speak) It goes without saying that the control system is anything but complex: Urban Hero runs automatically, and all the user has to do is press the context-sensitive keys or at most move sideways by pressing 4 or 6, in order to choose the path that you deem most appropriate. Although the level design is rather sophisticated and the objectives of the various missions are all in all quite varied, the same cannot be said of their implementation in the game economy: for the entire duration of the adventure, one does nothing but perform the same two-three actions, which soon become boring. In particular, Jump Free Running suffers from an excessively improper exploitation of the wall-running stunt, which is used in the vast majority of stages as the only means of achieving the designated objectives. Switches to press, windows to break, alarms to activate: almost everything passes through wall running, with obvious penalties for the variety and attractiveness of the product in the long run. Jump Free Running is effectively a game that exhausts all its topics during the first handful of levels, then resolving in a continuous ~already seen~. This is undoubtedly a major limitation of the Living Mobile title, which ends up being more repetitive than fun, moreover without being able to count on the contribution of a terrific technical achievement.
