{"name": "Tokobot Plus - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tokobot-plus-recensione.html", "text": "The Mystery of the Karakuri The story behind Tokobot Plus takes up and deepens the one already seen on PSP: in a world where technology is based on the rediscovery of the work of vanished civilizations, research groups set themselves the goal of exploring the ruins to reveal the secrets. The Karakuri, renamed ~Tokobot~, are precisely a gift from the ancestors: automatons capable of obeying the commands of a qualified pilot, in order to endow him with exceptional powers. Bolt, the protagonist of the game, is precisely one of these pilots and we will follow him in his research missions within many different stages. At his side a variable number of Tokobots, which we will gradually increase and whose technological potential will be conquered as we proceed, enriching themselves with new functions. Bolt can also count on a support team that follows him at a distance and possibly shows him what to do, and then takes care of analyzing the objects and upgrades collected once the character returns to base. At a strictly numerical level, Tokobot Plus has a total of ten stages plus various minigames, some new characters compared to the PSP version, more than thirty different enemies and sixteen bosses, as well as an unprecedented Time Attack mode, or the possibility of replaying completed levels taking into account the stopwatch. The game Tokobot Plus is very similar to Ape Escape in its setting, this is because it places the player in front of freely explorable scenarios, which can hide surprises (in this case the minigames) and which must be tackled using the skills that are conquered from time to time. Bolt has the ability to ~join~ his Tokobots in three basic configurations: single file (Square button), next to each other (Triangle button), or in a circle arrangement (Circle button). Once the robots are arranged in the desired way, it is possible to press one of the back buttons for the formation to ~join~, then press the button relating to the union to perform the action associated with it. In this case, when Bolt and the Tokobots are in single file and unite, by pressing the Square button the character ~grabs~ the chain formed by the small automatons and throws it forward as if it were a huge whip. It is a move that has an offensive value against enemies, but which also lends itself to overcoming obstacles: where there is a magnet, the Tokobot chain adheres and actually transforms into a ladder that allows Bolt to climb on the platform. The same goes for the ~barrier~ configuration, with the protagonist and the robots side by side: by pressing Circle after joining, they all join hands and begin to rotate at great speed, easily breaking objects, activating mechanisms and eliminating enemies safely (but when the whirlwind ends, Bolt and the Tokobots become dizzy or even fall to the ground stunned...). And the ~circle~ configuration? Well, in this way all the characters jump together and can produce the classic ~power landing~, a maneuver of little offensive value but which serves to activate the switches located on the floor. These basic configurations were soon joined by other very particular ones, which can be activated by pressing buttons (as in the case of the Aerosamurai, very useful in battles) or when you find yourself in a ~hot spot~ (see the crane configuration ). [C] The game is; full of puzzles, and the skills to of Bolt are often the key to solving them. Against side-armored enemies, a top-down attack is effective. the ideal. One of the many Tokobot applications... [/C] Technical realization As mentioned above, Tokobot Plus is very reminiscent of Ape Escape in setting. Unfortunately, however, the Tecmo team was unable to obtain the same technical results as the Sony product: the graphics engine is often in difficulty and the frame rate, in general, is not among the best ever seen on PlayStation2. The character design of the characters visible during the speeches, in pure anime style, is really, really great. Everything else, however, has ups and downs: the characters and enemies are well done, while the locations are often anonymous. And the sound also ends up being anonymous, made up of music that fails to leave its mark and effects that do not go beyond the discreet. The Italian version of the game boasts a good translation of the texts on the screen. Those aspects that undermined the usability of the game on PSP and that had to disappear on PS2 deserve a separate discussion... well, unfortunately the developers have only managed to smooth out these defects, because the difficulties in managingand view are still there (whenever you're near a wall) and the speed in the use of transformations is improved but is still slow if the intentions were to make the character more agile and quick. Comment Tokobot Plus is a fun game, quite vast in its various facets and featuring an innovative gameplay for its genre, focused on solving different puzzles within each stage. It certainly has some problems, especially of a technical nature (graphics not up to par with the latest PS2 titles, some problems in the visuals, not very responsive control system), but in general it is a recommended purchase, above all because of the ~promotional~ price at which it is offered. So if you want an ~alternative~ platformer, which requires the use of the brain and which allows you to explore the locations with a certain freedom, Tokobot Plus is to be taken into serious consideration ... unless you already own the version PSP, that is. Pros: Addictive and stimulating gameplay Excellent anime-style character design Low selling price Cons: Uncertain graphics engine Problems in managing the view Sometimes the use of Tokobots is slow PSP owners only a few months ago were able to play with Tokobot, which presented itself as an interesting alternative to classic action games due to its ~puzzle-platform~ setting. Now comes the PlayStation2 version of the game, enriched in the title by a ~Plus~ that undoubtedly characterizes it: not a sequel, but a reinterpretation whose main aim is the elimination of the defects that undermined the gameplay on PSP.
