Or titles and that's it. It was a decidedly niche game, developed thinking above all of fans of the sport in question, immediately presenting itself as very technical and difficult to metabolize, a roughness that the authors tried to alleviate in Stoked: Big Air Edition. After arriving on the American market last November, the game arrives in Europe decidedly quietly these days, almost 4 months after its American release, a frankly incomprehensible gap for the Destineer production. The structure is the same as the first Stoked, of which this edition represents a sort of ~director's cut~, therefore it remains a game intended above all for enthusiasts, with a learning curve that gives little to those who want to immediately launch into superhuman tricks without spending too much time learning the control system. Wanting to make a comparison, this title occupies a similar position to that of Skate in the context of skateboard simulations, at least looking at its positioning compared to the competition at the time of the first chapter. It is therefore not an easy game, not even very funny at first, to tell the truth, but it can give great satisfaction to those who persevere in training and refining their technique, after at least a few hours of practice. It is clear that this determines a certain gap in the possible users, between those who intend to willingly accept the high rate of technique required to remain standing after each trick attempt and those who instead will abandon the controller on the tenth attempt make a specific jump and land intact. On top of the world By setting, Stoked could be assimilated to a sort of free-roaming on a board, so to speak: we have 7 mountains available on which to perform and for each there are different possible routes depending on the launch point, which can be reached by helicopter. Once thrown off the helicopter in question, we find ourselves moving with a certain freedom on the mountain side, wanting to reach the valley in complete freedom, launching ourselves at speed on the slopes, performing tricks on the elements of the scenery scattered around or discovering new tracks outside track to the foot of the mountain, collecting points based on your performance. Or we can go hunting for the challenges scattered along the ridge and which can be activated, once you get nearby, with the simple push of a button, divided into standard requests such as timed runs, ~conquering~ points of interest by collecting the greatest number of points possible, performing ~contextual~ tricks or direct challenges on jumps or specific tricks on request. You can also take part in the various ~challenges~ directly from the main menu, a convenient way above all to complete them all without having to look for the missing ones each time, but the charm of discovery still makes it advisable to independently explore the mountain in search of objectives to to unlock. There is obviously an editor for creating the character and for customizing his appearance through physical modifications and application of clothing and accessories taken directly from the catalogs of the various famous brands in the snowboarding field, but it is rather difficult to understand within the game a leitmotif that somehow carries forward the ~story~ of this boarder launched to conquer notoriety and a sponsor within a career evidently inserted at a later time as the glue of the numerous challenges scattered throughout the mountains. Obviously these are marginal elements in such a game, but also given the rather high difficulty at first, the sense of disorientation that accompanies us once we are launched from the helicopter is quite evident. The harsh law of the table Even the control system partially recalls Skate, only that inserted in a context like this, characterized by high speed and the greater scale of jumps and distances to cover, things get a little more complicated. More than the abstruse keystrokes to memorize, what we need to keep in mind here are some fundamental movements on which numerous variations are applied to perform the various tricks. A first element with which it is immediately necessary to deal with is timing, which requires a precise calculation of jump and landing times, necessary to be able to perform the required maneuvers and then align the board with the snowy surface as precisely as possible, pento the inevitable crash. It is not a simple thing because the tendency towards realism does not allow spending very long times in the air and therefore giving way to aligning in time, immediately requiring extreme mastery of the movements to be performed in order to combine spectacular action with correctness of movements and balance of the table, which can quickly become frustrating for all those who do not intend to spend a long time learning the game mechanics. Only after a certain amount of hours of play is it possible to really get satisfaction from Stoked: Big Air Edition, when you start to win the fight with the control system and the board tames under your fingers, at which point being able to ring a series of tricks in combination and landing perfectly intact on the snow becomes a truly exhilarating experience, but to get there you have to sweat a bit and it's not said that the condition is acceptable to everyone. Once a good degree of mastery has been achieved, it is also possible to access the various multiplayer game modes, which substantially replicate the challenges present in the single-player career but against human opponents, adding further depth to the playful offer present in the game. Xbox 360 goals 48 goals for 1000 points is the prize in Stoked: Big Air. Given the nature of the game, the collection of objectives depends above all on the performance of our boarder within the various challenges proposed or in the downhill runs, therefore the complete collection requires a certain dedication to be carried out and completed. The daring descents The glance is truly remarkable, once launched from the helicopter, it is probably the most spectacular moment of the entire gaming experience linked to Stoked: Big Air Edition. Imagine the scene: you choose the release point and you are heli-transported to the top of a Patagonian mountain (but right at the top) and once you hit the snow, kilometers of descent open up like an abyss just below your snowboard. We launch ourselves down almost in free fall, trees and structures begin to glimpse only much further down, while impossible slopes and outcropping rocks hiss around us, with an excellent blur effect the scenery fades to well represent the falling speed we are reaching on the crunching snow and numerous possibilities open up below, placing us with the choice of where to go and what to do with all that snowy vastness. The experience of free descent and execution of tricks without the need to follow pre-established routes or perform certain actions is perhaps the greatest moment of enjoyment that Stoked can give, also thanks to the good sensation of speed it can give and the more than satisfactory modeling of the scenario, as well as the realistic sensation given by the snow in its various conditions, which is increased by the meteorological variations that occur in real time during the descent. Some uncertainty is found in the modeling of the boarders and in some animations (the possibility of climbing entire mountains ~walking~ with the board under your feet is quite ridiculous) and in various cases as regards the contact between the polygons, on the basis of which frequently you can find yourself stuck against trees or other elements of the scenario or condemned to constantly crash into the same obstacle because the game reinserts us too close to the point of impact in the descent. Nonetheless, the experience of the descent is still spectacular, particularly once you get the hang of the control system, and find yourself wishing you could stretch the length of the tracks out of proportion to keep hurtling through the snow. The audio side is not noted for particular solutions, characterized by the customary sampled voices (note the decidedly verbose helicopter pilot) and by the classic supply of licensed tracks ranging from hip hop to punk, from alternative rock to melodic hardcore.", "date": "2011-03-09", "grade": "8.0"}
