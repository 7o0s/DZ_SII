An action / strategic component is in fact practically always present where an undead appears; instead imagining a Tetris or a Bejeweled in strong dark colors appears, at least until today, at least unlikely. However, the developers of Containment: The Zombie Puzzler (hereafter simply Containment) are keen to clearly underline that their work is substantially different from what has been seen to date, marking a clear distance in terms of gameplay from the two cornerstones of the genre mentioned just above. Ninete zombie-blocks to cancel then, and not even groups of three to line up and then disappear: here, as in the best horror tradition, the undead must be surrounded, contained and brutally slaughtered. Salvation lies in organization The new approach chosen for Containment, despite the initial familiarity given by the square grid in perfect Bejeweled style, is revealed immediately after actually starting to play: in fact, inside the matrix there are no symbols or gems, but a heterogeneous group of characters, divided between survivors and zombies. Leaving aside the usual causes of zombification linked to the escape of viruses and the like, the group of survivors to be saved is in turn made up of four categories: policemen, soldiers, punks/thugs and researchers. In the game grid, in which each character stands still, all the components (including the zombies) are arranged randomly; the player's task is to surround a single infected or a group on each side, using however the same category of survivors, all before the infection spreads through the bites of the infected. Surrounding a zombie with cops, for example, causes them to shoot it with a shotgun, annihilating it. Clearly, the highest score and the best bonuses are in the presence of multiple or successive kills, by the standards of the genre; in particular, each category of survivors is able to release some power-ups to the player, which are really useful for solving the most complicated situations. A multi-kill by cops grants the option of a sniper shot, a multi-kill by soldiers grants the opportunity to throw a grenade; the thugs give away an always useful incendiary Molotv cocktail while the researchers, consistent with their role, give a special suit capable of withstanding a single attack as a kind gift. In addition to these bonuses, other types of mass attacks can randomly be found, such as air support (which eliminates an entire horizontal row of the grid, but including survivors) and lightning, which kills three contiguous characters (again without distinction between healthy and infected). The management and use of these upgrades must be subject to a minimum of tactics, given the presence of only three slots for storage. As a further element of unpredictability, elements of the background close to the explosion will often occur (they are the famous and very unstable ~red barrels~), or vehicles that will invest part of the characters, thus ~thinning~ a good percentage of presences; on the other hand, it will not be uncommon to suffer attacks from hidden zombies who, advancing from the ends of the game framework, will transform the closest survivors. The simplicity and intuitiveness of Containment is also confirmed by the immediate control system chosen: with a slide of the finger, in fact, one can naturally move a unit from one place to another, thus creating the right encircles in just a few seconds. As the adventure progresses, the resistance of the undead inevitably increases: with more powerful creatures, in fact, at least two containments will be needed for elimination. These sorts of Bosses appear substantially from mid-story onwards: we point out here a curious zombie wizard who, to be killed, needs a precise type of encirclement each time, indicated by the color of his aura. The technical aspect, given the particular context, assumes greater importance here than a simple puzzle game: the entire game environment is in fact in 3D, with perfect attention to detail (complete with a working Drive In cinema!) and with great textures. The characters are also reproduced in polygonal form and, although small in size, they appear well cared for and animated in a credible way. However, it is the whole ~Dead Nation~ atmosphere that works well, thanks to an effective textual narration and background music that is not very original but still very spot on. One last note on thegeneral longevity, discreet if we consider only the Campaign but practically infinite given the presence of the Survival Mode and the Game Center objectives.
