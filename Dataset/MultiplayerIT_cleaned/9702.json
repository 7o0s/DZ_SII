{"name": "Calcio o calcetto?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81708-fifa-11-calcio-o-calcetto.html", "text": "Since the release of the Wii there has always been much debate about its possible belonging to the ~next-gen~, ideally represented by the combination PS3-Xbox360. Without wanting to give a definitive answer here, there is no doubt that the Wii has taken a distant path from that of its rivals, a path that many software houses have had difficulty following, precisely because of the different approach to video games - ideological and technological - which the Nintendo console dictates. Thus, while in the ~rest of the world~ this generation has sanctioned the historic and unexpected overtaking of the FIFA series against PES, on Wii we have witnessed a completely different story: Konami has pulled a fantastic Nintendo-sized PES out of its hat - the whose rise has been blocked only by low sales, due in part to the complexity of the game - while EA, since 2006, has been struggling to reconcile its series with the possibilities - and limitations - offered by the Wii. Soccer Last year FIFA had veered towards an arcade spectacularization of the experience: not a wrong choice, given that many Nintendo fans have been waiting for years for the spiritual successor of International Superstar Soccer (basically dead about a decade ago), a pity that the realization was not all 'height. This year, given the results, EA has taken a step back: while maintaining a caricatured graphic style - like in the previous episode - the game has been brought back to (pseudo) simulation tracks. The problem, as we mentioned earlier, is that FIFA has managed to surpass PES only in recent years, essentially because EA, unlike Konami, has properly exploited the potential guaranteed by Xbox360 and PS3, recreating from scratch the basis of its own game: bases that, given the lesser capabilities of Nintendo hardware, cannot be transplanted to the Wii. This FIFA 11, although not a poor title, does not differ much from its predecessors (excluding the 2010 edition, of course): far from the levels of excellence achieved by the versions on Microsoft and Sony consoles, it limits itself to offering a simple football simulation immediate and shallow. The game offers three different types of control: Wiimote only, Wiimote + Nunchuk and Classic Controller. The option represented by the remote control alone is to be discarded a priori: it is simple but far from intuitive, it generates a cumbersome and unstable gameplay, and if it had been mandatory it would certainly have given life to a product well below the sufficiency. The Wiimote-Nunchuk combination is the best compromise between simplicity and complexity, even if it is extremely limiting compared to the traditional controller: this is because the feints are entrusted to the directional cross - awkward to reach during the action - and, above all, because it passes low to the ground and cross are performed with the same button, simply varying the pressure (which is very, very cumbersome and not very immediate). The question of feints might seem secondary, but in an approximate simulation like this it is not: if in the best football games most of the dribbling - as in reality - is done by feinting the pass or with simple changes of direction, in FIFA 11 it is mainly discarded by relying on the sole touches of the individual players, which require more frenzy than timing. In general, the possibility - and above all there is no need - of articulating great offensive maneuvers is not granted during ball possession, and the same thing happens in the defensive phase: in short, one concentrates on the selected player without too many tactics, and this it is one of the features that deprive the game of the depth that one would expect. Leaving aside Xbox360 and PS3, and leaving aside the splendid PES for Wii, it is no exaggeration to say that this FIFA 11 is even less fun and realistic than the traditional PES on PS2. soccer As usual there are various modes in addition to the friendly - various leagues and tournaments, all decorated with authentic names and brands in pure FIFA style - but they are all rather sketchy: perhaps EA has tried to simplify them to make them more attractive to the infamous ~casual gamer ~, with the only result of crippling them in the eyes of enthusiasts. In this sense, the managerial section is exemplary, which really appears to have been put there by chance - it is limited and simplistic both in the management of the company and of the team. The most interesting secondary mode of this edition is undoubtedly five-a-side football, which is a mix between the one appreciated (and never seen again) in FIFA 98 and the recent FIFA Street, as well as having a splash of Mario Strikers. Let's immediately appease the easy enthusiasms: in FIFA 11 even soccer is not at the state of the art, for various reasons. First of all because the problem of theThe management of feints - and therefore of dribbling - is magnified by the confined spaces, so that all the actions are quite chaotic and not very reasoned. Secondly, because the possibilities offered by the beating wall have not been explored at all and, on the contrary, the banks are accessory and annoying: in most cases, in fact, it is the CPU that decides when and how to use the walls. Third, because five-a-side football is treated as a stand-alone modality, and therefore is not declined in relation to the others: there are no championships or tournaments, just friendlies. The online multiplayer works fairly well, by Wii standards it is certainly above average: the lag is almost always there, but it is almost always not very annoying, and opponents to play with are easily found. However, it is precisely the online matches that bring to the surface all the contradictions of FIFA 11: in an environment where expert players meet, willing to do anything to win (as usual, in short) you notice how the best ways to score are anything but what canons - sole touches in front of the goalkeeper and lobs on the defender, but above all the hateful habit of getting the ball up (shaking the nunchuk) before shooting, so as to have it halfway up rather than on the ground.", "date": "2010-10-26", "grade": "6.5"}
