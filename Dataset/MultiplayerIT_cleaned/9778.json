If, in addition to being clear about what we are talking about, you have played and appreciated the turn-based RPG developed by Airship Syndicate, then you will have no difficulty in letting yourself be captivated by this small but fascinating excerpt from the rich narrative universe of League of Legends which, thanks to the Netflix series Arcane (here the review), lives a new, well-deserved glory. It is always a turn-based role-playing game, whose mechanics do not differ from Battle Chasers, and therefore they may seem like two products that are all too similar, however the heart of Ruined King beats more thanks to the narrative component. Which is not to be understood in the least as a demerit on the gameplay side, but as a specification on what, on balance, completely differentiates the two games. To find out in detail, come with us to Bilgewater to the court of Sarah ~Miss~ Fortune, where our review of Ruined King: A League of Legends Story begins. A League of Legends Story The cover of Ruined King: A League of Legends Story After an introduction set just over a millennium before the events narrated, we are in Bilgewater: Sarah Fortune has for some years obtained the city for herself, snatching it from the control of the cruel Gangplank after killing him, avenging her mother's death at the hands of the pirate same. His government over the city has yet to find the balance and the presence of the Shadows, coming from the nearby island, does not help. Winning out, not without huge losses, from a previous Reaping (the moment in which the Shadows run amok without control on anyone in the vicinity), Sarah will find herself facing an identical if not worse threat. Together with her, once again, the priestess of the Kraken, Illaoi, and a series of new companions who, for one reason or another, will travel the same path. The objectives are different but they all seem to lead to the same place: between unlikely alliances and ancient enemies, the story of Ruined King takes shape. Told through cinematics that are beautiful to look at and dialogues supported by equally excellent, albeit static character portraits, the stories take their time before taking off. There is a way to get to know all the characters well, from Sarah Fortune to Yasuo, before going to where it all seems to originate. The dialogues are well written and the Italian dubbing enhances them even more in tone, making them pleasant to enjoy even at their own pace. The same goes for the optional conversations, small events that are unlocked during the rest phases and give way both to better understand the characters and to see how they bond with their companions. Overall we are satisfied with the narration which also sees some NPCs dubbed, giving the game world even more depth. The question that arises at this point is: can a newcomer to League of Legends play Ruined King without feeling at fault? Without a doubt: the beauty of this game is right here, in the fact that you don't necessarily have to know characters and events to enjoy the story. The latter is, in fact, set after the events of Burning Tides, a story used to introduce the city of Bilgewater, but knowing them is irrelevant to understanding the plot - as is knowing Sarah and the others. It can come in handy to better appreciate certain nuances but if we talk about the Ruined King plot itself, you can go calmly. A familiar gameplay The cast of Ruined King: A League of Legends Story The play structure of Ruined King is the most linear there can be. It picks up with both hands from the previous Battle Chasers and brings back to the screen an experience that is simple in its exposition but no less fun than others we may be used to. There is the main mission to follow, any secondary ones to unlock, a few bounties here and there and a lot of exploration, especially if we think that there are two main settings in the game. The game knows how to hold us back, especially thanks to an already challenging level of challenge in normal mode (it can be changed at any time): the fact that above this there are two more makes Ruined King the excellent testing ground for those looking for a challenge of a certain level. At your own risk, though. Although similar to Battle Chasers, the title is not its carbon copy and, on the contrary, it evolves in many respects; first of all, the growth of the characters. With each level up, our champions gain consequent benefits that can range from learning skills, obtaining runes, upgrade points and finally, possibility of increasing the effectiveness of both runes and the skills themselves. All this works quite simply and can be changed at any time to find the most suitable combination in battle. All skills are learned autonomously by leveling up, while their effectiveness is dictated by us through a tiny development tree (the same in form but different in substance depending on the skill): by spending the upgrade points we can improve the aforementioned skill to according to the path that pleases us the most, choosing each time A or B based on the applied effects. The variety may seem limited, but the difference in the fight is perceived, thus making an unnecessarily stretched development tree unnecessary. The skills are then accompanied by the runes, which have a dedicated menu and more or less follow the same concept as the upgrades. They can be improved by spending rune fragments, but the latter must progressively be spent in greater quantities to be able to unlock the next skill. They are also locked until a specific character level is reached, making grinding necessary if you want to upgrade your champion to the max. Like upgrades, runes also have two possible approaches to choose to develop the character, with the difference that one does not preclude the other. It just takes more time to improve as you want.

It should be noted that during the progression there is no on-screen indicator that indicates the direction to take, both during the story and in the middle of a side mission. From time to time it is necessary to open the map and check where you are based on the objective - that is in fact reported but the tokens are the same for story and missions. It is up to us, based on the indications, to understand which one corresponds to our needs of the moment. Moving through the different environments is quite fast, the characters can run or maintain a slower pace and depending on who we are using it is possible to notice a slight difference in speed. Fast travel to macro areas of the city can also be used within Bilgewater, while dungeons tend to have shortcuts to unlock along the way. Overall, while being familiar to those who know Battle Chasers, Ruined King offers an approach if not new at least fresh and in line in some respects with the mechanics of the original League of Legends - such as the runes. Lane combat A fight from Ruined King: A League of Legends Story However, there is a real novelty within the Ruined King system and it is found in its combat system. Conceptually, the game once again looks to the past and offers us instant attacks, skills, waves and the overload mechanic. The real strong point, the one that rewrites the RPG approach a bit and is the basis of all in-game strategy, is the Lane mechanic. There are three in total: Speed Lane, Balance Lane, and Power Lane. The names are quite explanatory in themselves, but if you are wondering, the first allows you to position yourself favorably along the timeline and act quickly at the expense of the damage, which will be slightly lower; the second is instead well balanced both in terms of speed and damage done; the third rests entirely on brutality and, sacrificing speed of action, scores devastating attacks. The entire combat system is built around the Lane not just as a matter of priority, but of structure. In fact, the enemies have skills that often require the careful management of the lanes to emerge victorious and it is here that the possibility of examining the enemy must be made equally good use. Some fights in particular require the use of specific lanes for the entire duration of the fight, or to switch from one to another depending on the need of the moment; in some cases, there are even lanes closed not so much because they are literally closed, but because exploiting them would lead to nothing. Each new clash, as long as the difference between the levels is not sufficient in itself to ignore some logic, is a challenge, especially since Ruined King hardly puts us in a marked advantage. As we have written, the experience is already demanding on normal difficulty and sometimes a trifle is enough to find yourself defeated. This is not mere brute force, Ruined Kingrequires careful use of champions and their abilities, whose chains of effects can prove to be the dividing line between victory and defeat. The fact, then, of seeing the weaker enemies fleeing in front of us helps to understand which battles are worth facing: an implementation that is not so obvious, that of premature escape, since not all RPGs apply it and there are times in whose enemies ignore their safeguard to commit suicide. In this case, however, it is known in advance which battles may be worthwhile, especially since the grinding is heavy - and is perhaps the main criticism of Ruined King. The experience points gained are more or less equally divided among all party members, active or not. The maximum cap to level up is always a thousand, which softens the issue a little, but when the group members begin to increase, the weight of a rather invasive grinding is perceived even more. This is especially noticeable with the bosses or an ~evolved~ version of the basic enemies: their strength, even at the same level (or even lower), can be sufficient to kill a champion on the spot but the experience points obtained at the end do not make justice to the effort necessary to emerge victorious. With such a system, we would have preferred greater generosity in the exp, if only with the bosses, but also minimally with the most common clashes, given the appreciable underlying difficulty. We understand the need, given the level cap, nevertheless a greater balance would not have spoiled. Technical and artistic sector The art style of Ruined King: A League of Legends Story is remarkable As anticipated, Ruined King is a game that boasts the artistic direction of Joe Madureira and for this reason it is very appreciable. There isn't much variety in the settings, being basically only two macro areas of the adventure (Bilgewater and the Isle of Shadows), however there is an undeniable attention to detail that offers added value to the total yield. Excellent design of the characters and monsters, whether they are portraits during the dialogues or in-game models, and as already mentioned the Italian dubbing makes everything much more appreciable. In terms of the soundtrack, progress has been made compared to Battle Chasers and some tracks are pleasant to hear, even if they don't shine to the point of remaining etched in the memory. From a technical point of view we have not seen any uncertainties whatsoever: the game is fluid, no crashes or bugs.", "date": "2021-11-21", "grade": "8.5"}
