{"name": "Magnetic Joe 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/magnetic-joe-2_a.html", "text": "The answer - we reveal it immediately - is a decisive and convinced ~yes~. Because Magnetic Joe 2 proposes the exceptional play structure that had made the fortune of the prequel, but enriching it with such a quantity of elements as to make this second episode much more than a mere update. And such an aspect, in an era of sequels that often rest on their laurels, really does the developers of this little gem a credit. But let's go in order, starting with a brief introduction dedicated to anyone unfamiliar with the In-Fusio product. In Magnetic Joe, the user controls a purple magnetized sphere, and has the task of making it move from the beginning to the end of each stage by simply pressing the '5' key: this allows the ball to be electrically charged, allowing it to approach the scattered magnets strategically at various points in the levels. As is evident, the basic concept is as simple as it is ingenious: unlike many one-thumb games, which exhaust their topics within a few minutes, Magnetic Joe 2 manages to be at the same time immediate like few others but capable of provide a continuous challenge, thanks to a favorable concatenation of factors. First of all, a special credit must be given to the developers of Most Wanted as regards the work done on the level design: despite the high number of stages (100 in total), each of them presents new situations compared to the previous ones, which in any case rest always on the peculiar magnetic nature of our Joe. Even in terms of game modes, the commitment made by the programmers is evident and appreciable. Magnetic Joe 2 offers four main sections, which differ mainly in the objectives required by the stages that are part of it: consequently, the Training Mode is a sort of small encyclopedia to familiarize yourself with all the game elements; the Classic Mode is the standard mode basically based on the act of passing from one magnet to another while avoiding obstacles; the Collect Mode requires the user to collect all the Little Joes scattered here and there before being able to access the exit; finally, the Enemy Mode offers levels populated by enemies that must be rigorously avoided. As if that weren't enough, Magnetic Joe 2 also features a section called Skateboards in which, aboard a board, Joe can collect a whole series of otherwise unattainable extra objects, which serve to unlock certain contents: mainly, these are small variations accessories, such as those that make Joe invisible or give him a meaner look. Excellent from a gameplay point of view, Magnetic Joe 2 is also impeccable from a technical point of view: the graphics are certainly not the best ever seen on a mobile phone, but they prove to be perfectly suited to the purpose, without skimping on a few touches class (especially with regard to the fun and varied skits that mark the passage or not to the next stage), while the sound offers decidedly above average funky music.
