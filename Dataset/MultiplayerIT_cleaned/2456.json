{"name": "The Next Tetris", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-next-tetris.html", "text": "Shall we play with bricks? For those unfamiliar with it, the aim of the game is to form a line with blocks of bricks that will descend in a continuous cycle towards the bottom of the screen, while avoiding forming piles of blocks full of holes and filling the whole screen , under penalty of Game Over. Unfortunately, however, apart from the nostalgia and the fun that the game can create, the other side of the coin is represented precisely by this too retro style and without innovations which, despite the good technical side of the product (which sufficiently exploits the resources available from the Sega machine both in terms of graphics and sound, with perhaps sometimes a little too lively pieces and remixes that should pay homage to the creator of the game; Alexey Pajitnov), could make the game boring only after a few games and, although choose between two modes - one classic the other designed specifically for the new version - definitely too similar, face the game against another human player or try to last as long as possible, this remake (sorry for the term a bit too cinematic !) turns out to be too withdrawn. A few small changes, such as the introduction of a level selection mode similar to that of Bust a Move or the possibility of facing opponents controlled by the CPU, would have been enough to breathe some fresh air into a game concept that, to me sorry to repeat myself, although excellent it has already been outdated and multi-fruited for some time. Game over! Essentially therefore, we are faced with an almost completely invaluable product, which must be looked at from time to time with different eyes: in fact, we cannot crush a title that has made history and which is now being proposed again with the same game concept , albeit embellished, after years, but we can't even praise the choice of programmers not to change or add anything; especially since here we have a game sold at full price, with no place whatsoever in a collection of classics. I still want to commend the developers for not upsetting a milestone in gaming history and I appreciate their attempt to give the Dreamcast a relevant and appealing puzzle game but unfortunately, I fear that not all younger gamers will appreciate it and neither old people will want to spend a slice of their savings on a game that has already been tried and appreciated several times My only advice is to try it, and try again the same feelings with which you met Tetris (or Cube Up or how the hell did you know it) in golden times. Pros: Good old Tetris... Fun as always Cons: Outdated game? No innovations The return of a legend The other day, wandering around the net, I came across an article from a videogame site that questioned the true value of today's reissues of the classics of the past, revisited with a modern three-dimensional guise and most often created not as tributes to the 'was that it was but as a mere commercial operation. Contrary to the negative expectations that the latest revisions had left us, first of all the delirious new edition of Frogger, this The Next Tetris is a product created in all simplicity, with the spirit of the original title left unchanged and without radical changes of graphics or of setting of the game, with a result practically equal to what was one of the most played games (and converted, even in the form of identical clones but with different names) of the 80s/90s.", "date": "2001-07-09", "grade": null}
