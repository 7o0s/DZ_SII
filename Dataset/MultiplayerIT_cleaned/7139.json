A task that basically consists of wearing several helmets and waiting for a colleague to drop a hammer on your head, recording the intensity of the blow on a scale of one to five stars. But what falls on Ray in a day like any other is not a work tool, but something very different: a mysterious creature that sneaks into his brain, giving him extraordinary power. In fact, the boy finds himself with a sort of huge ~sticky hand~ sticking out of his head, which only he can see and which allows him to read the thoughts of the people around him and possibly grasp their ideas as if they were stickers. And what do you do with a sticker, if not stick it somewhere? The preamble seems sufficient to describe the gameplay of Stick it to the Man, the platform-based adventure developed by Zoink. Already available for some time on PC, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, the game made its debut last week on PlayStation 4 and can be downloaded for free by registered PlayStation Plus users. Stick it to the Man is a crazy and fun adventure, with a pleasant and peculiar style Stickers everywhere The first thing that strikes you about the game is undoubtedly the peculiar drawing style adopted by the developers, which sees Ray and the other characters as two-dimensional figures, real cardboard cutouts (this is also demonstrated by the numerous checkpoint machines) with the yellow skin like that of the Simpsons, but characterized by decidedly more ~dirty~ and irregular features. Together with a design of the scenarios that it is not enough to define bizarre, between acid colors and improbable roads that develop without any respect for the laws of physics, the solutions adopted prove to be absolutely original and unique. The interaction with the locations is entrusted to our ~psychic hand~, which is controlled via the right analog stick and allows us to pull the ~sheets~ away from the buildings to show new places, perhaps with other characters hidden inside them. Using the same expedient, by pressing the L2 back button it is possible to enter ~mind reading~ mode and connect to a person's brain to read his thoughts (listening to them via the DualShock 4 speaker), an operation which generally unlocks further quests, in the in particular the finding of a particular sticker and its application in the right place. One of the first missions we'll have to do, for example, is to help a taxi driver who wants to commit suicide because his girlfriend, obsessed with perfect teeth, has left him for a mobster with gleaming teeth. A few interactions will be enough to understand that the elderly criminal is wearing false teeth, take them away and put them in the taxi driver's mouth, who will thus be able to win back his girlfriend. Paying attention to what the characters we come into contact with think usually gives us an idea of what they want, but as often happens with adventures it also happens to proceed by trial and error. Fortunately, the map of the levels, which can be recalled at any time by pressing the Square button, provides rather clear indications on the ~sensitive~ points and therefore on where it is appropriate to go. The more advanced stages of the campaign, made up of ten chapters in total, also feature Super Mario-style pipes that allow us to move quickly from one extreme of the setting to the other, so as to make the inevitable backtracking less annoying. Playstation 4 trophies There are sixteen Trophies that can be obtained by playing Stick it to the Man, and most of them are obtained simply by continuing in the adventure, or by coming into contact with certain characters and reading their minds. Without wanting to make particular advances, for example, it will be necessary to read the thoughts of all the characters, complete the stealth phases without being discovered and be chased by five enemies at the same time. I know what you are thinking In short, Stick it to the Man presents itself as the most classic of adventures, although the interface is not ~point and click~ but rather ~detach and stick~. The strength of the Zoink-branded product lies above all in its peculiar characterization, both from a graphic point of view and from a narrative point of view, full of effective humor, which manages to render well even in English and with Italian subtitles. Of course, the absence of dubbing in our language - which, we realize, was not feasible for a production of this type - inevitably means losing something. The compaHowever, the sound is of excellent quality, both for the funny dialogues, recited by a cast in great style, and for the music that accompanies the action, spot on and of great class. The game does not even lack a certain incidence of the platform element, which in some situations (when you have to overcome the agents under the orders of the ~Boss~, for example) proves to be fairly challenging and even open to small stealth facets. In fact, we find ourselves having to avoid being discovered by the enemies by bypassing them, avoiding their field of vision and taking advantage as soon as possible, during the possible escape, of the ~drawing pins~ that connect one platform to another and which fall within the aforementioned vision of a world made of cardboard, in which Ray can move easily thanks to the support of his special appendix. In the end, the adventure does not last very long, since it is possible to complete it in about four hours, but it heralds a decidedly different experience from the usual, very pleasant, fun and light. It goes without saying that the download is a must for anyone who subscribes to PlayStation Plus.", "date": "2014-05-07", "grade": "8.0"}
