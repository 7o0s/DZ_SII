In reality, it's a clever cover, because Monty cares about only one thing: money. It will therefore be up to Gromit to reveal the real intentions of the self-styled benefactor and save the puppies in danger. Perhaps due to the fact that we are talking about canine quadrupeds, the third episode of the series sees Gromit as the absolute protagonist of all three phases of the game. This is good, because although Wallace's shoulder is silent, he wins in eloquence thanks to his priceless expressions. We will therefore get to know a new supporting actor, the aforementioned Mr. Muzzle, and we will be able to visit the village fair, which will prove to be a whirlwind of ideas as amusing as they are unpredictable. The cast of already known supporting actors is all there, but in this case the Telltales have managed to perfectly balance their presence. They have also done something more: each of them is involved in a personal story, which often intertwines with that of another character, developing short narrative events that go hand in hand with the resolution of a puzzle. Meanwhile, the main story progresses without running, and then takes off (literally) in the finale. In addition, the course of events is punctuated by some of the funniest gags seen to date, and connects elements of the world of Wallace & Gromit that were shown in the first two episodes. Muzzled therefore rewards the player's loyalty, and reconfirms the creativity and experience of the developers. Curiosity Muzzled is the third in a series of four episodes dedicated to Wallace & Gromit and developed by Telltale. Every month Multiplayer.it presents the complete review of the new episode. Please note that it is not possible to purchase the episodes separately, as they are only sold as a complete package. Full Monty The puzzles follow the same difficulty curve that Telltales have accustomed us to. Initially we have to recover some objects nearby and get to know the supporting characters, while in the second and third parts the puzzles are solved several times. There is of course the puzzle of the right sentence to compose, a hallmark of the series, and also a short mini-game. Above all, the developers have designed some of the least boring puzzles seen recently. The puzzles are bizarre without losing their meaning and are solved by asking the right questions, rationally. They are also probably the simplest in the series, and you could finish the adventure in four hours: it's all up to you. However, the freshness of this third episode owes much to Monty Muzzle, the extravagant barker with an elegant speech. Even the translators were up to the task, successfully adapting the irony and linguistic register. Instead, it is useless to go back to the limits of the game, because the structure is always the same: we find the same defects related to the controls, for example. Let's rather look at it in the economics of the package. Wallace & Gromit: Muzzled is the most successful episode so far, also for visual impact, and if the fourth proves to be up to par, the series may not make us regret Sam & Max.", "date": "2009-06-22", "grade": "7.4"}
