{"name": "La settimana enigmistica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82299-saw-ii-flesh-blood-la-settimana-enigmistica.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3Puzzles, rebuses and puzzles usually fill our day on sunny beaches, while we lie in the sun and wait for the tan to take root. In the case of Jigsaw, things are different: he is a psychopathic killer who kidnaps his victims and tests them with gruesome puzzles, forcing them to make very difficult choices and giving them the illusion of being able to get away, somehow. The character that we find ourselves controlling in the first minutes of the game, for example, wakes up suddenly with a kind of metal collar fixed on his shoulders, which in the space of a minute will close on his head, impaling it. The only way to get rid of it is to cut into the right eyelid with a scalpel, insert your fingers and recover the key that the friendly Jigsaw has surgically implanted near the eye. An extremely painful ordeal, which however only marks the beginning of a long and distressing experience. After a few internships, the anonymous victim of the riddler's madness is replaced by the young Michael Tapp, the son of a policeman whom Jigsaw knows very well and who also finds himself imprisoned in an unspecified place, fighting for his life from the first moments after waking up. Michael moves barefoot and for this he must be careful not to step on broken glass or acidic substances, but above all he must find a way to find a way out and call for help. Unfortunately it won't be easy at all: the imaginative killer has not only filled the scenario with deadly traps and a huge number of puzzles, but he has also placed some of the criminals that the boy's father sent to prison, and who clearly die. from the desire to take revenge. Only in the dark Saw II: Flesh & Blood takes up what was seen in the first tie-in of the series, thus offering us a horror adventure for strong stomachs, dotted with puzzles that in certain cases may not even be solved, but whose outcome may still have consequences. The control system is typical of the latest survival horror, with a third-person view that shows us our character from behind. We can interact with the environment in various ways, turn on or off the lights or the flashlight (if we have one available) and run to cross the scenario more quickly. When we find a closed door, we can often force the lock using a nail or in any case a tool suitable for the purpose, and in this situation we will find ourselves facing a minigame in which we must move between the mechanisms of the lock or move them as we proceed towards the hole for the key. Similarly, the current generators must be reactivated through the classic puzzle in which there is an energy line that must be conducted from one point to another, rotating the circuits until they give life to this connection. Then there are the numeric combination padlocks, in which case we have to look carefully at the immediate surroundings in search of the code to enter. One of the first puzzles of the kind recalls the film ~Saw II~, given that to view the numbers you have to look at their reflections from a bathroom mirror and open the hot water tap for the steam to make the last digit appear on the glass. The presence of Jigsaw will be constant throughout the story, and the typical televisions that transmit the image of a puppet with his voice will often serve to introduce us to other victims like us, who however we will have the opportunity to save from a terrible fate by solving yet another puzzle. Playstation 3 trophies There are fifty-one trophies that we will be able to unlock by solving the terrible puzzles of Jigsaw. The twenty-six bronze trophies are generally obtained by solving the individual puzzles in record time, while for the silver ones it is necessary to recover the objects scattered within the locations. The gold trophies are all secret, and focus on the fate of the people we will be able to free from the traps of the puzzler, while finally the platinum trophy is obtained, as usual, by unlocking all the other trophies. The Curse of the QTEs In the first videogame transposition of Saw, our character sometimes found himself fighting for his life, and in these situations the action depended exclusively on our inputs, as in any survival horror. Although the combat system was not brilliant, this feature allowed us to break the monotony of the puzzles from time to time and to vent some of that anger that inevitably accumulates when you are forced to play the role of the trapped mouse for hours . For this sequel, unfortunately, the developers have not improved this component but rather have made itcompletely impersonal, entrusting the outcome of each physical confrontation to simple quick time events. However, this unfortunate intervention has the merit of highlighting the limits of the product created by Zombie Studios for Konami: in fact, if the gameplay of Saw II: Flesh & Blood had been more in Silent Hill style, or if within the locations we had found enemies to face with a traditional combat system, the experience would have benefited a lot and now we could discuss a tie-in that may not be phantasmagorical but still very engaging, especially for those who have appreciated the films dedicated to Jigsaw. The game uses Unreal Engine 3, but it's mostly wasted potential: the frame rate suffers from frequent uncertainties, the environments are very repetitive and have a low level of interaction (when they are not completely dark...), even the characters appear to lack particular attention to detail. In short, it seems to be dealing with an older generation title. The audio is very essential, the music is practically absent but there is a good amount of spoken English (subtitled in Italian).", "date": "2010-11-15", "grade": "6.0"}
