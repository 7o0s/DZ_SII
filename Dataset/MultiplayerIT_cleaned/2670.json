{"name": "Nioh 2 The Complete Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Exactly one year after the arrival of Nioh 2 on PlayStation 4, Team Ninja also arrives on the new Sony home, PS5, and on PC with Nioh 2 The Complete Edition. The publication of an inordinate amount of versions has left several users dumbfounded, confused as to which edition is best suited to their needs. In this case we will focus on the full version of Nioh 2, including all three of its DLCs and a series of technical revisions that increase its value both on consoles and on PC. Following this review of Nioh 2 The Complete Edition, we will also return to talk about the other strong point of the collection published on PlayStation 5: the remastered of the first chapter, also in a complete version of its DLCs. Demons are born Anyone with a minimum of familiarity with the Nioh series is aware of the fact that the narrative aspect is not the strong point of the production. Despite this, it cannot be denied that the charm of feudal Japan and the ability of Team Ninja to combine historical fidelity with the country's folklore represent a powerful mix that has been able to captivate many fans. Nioh 2 takes place earlier (for a good part of its main duration) than the original, delving into an even more remote period of medieval Japan, where it is said that demons were even more present, almost completely integrated into the real world. In this certainly not idyllic situation our protagonist moves, who compared to the progenitor is not a predetermined character, but who can be created using a decent editor, full of options. Once your alter ego is ready, you will be immediately catapulted into his story, made of memory loss and a double nature, which will soon make you both feared and disowned. In fact, we will discover from the very first moments that we ourselves are half-demon and only thanks to Tokichiro's support will we find that company and that brotherhood capable of making us continue our journey. During the missions that make up the long campaign of Nioh 2 you will be able to meet different figures of Japanese feudal dynasties, as well as seeing great leaders and various aberrations of the underworld at work. What will really remain impressed by the interweaving of Nioh 2 is not so much an exceptional narrative turn, which does not exist and is not even sought, as much as Team Ninja's desire to bring all the love for their culture to the screen, an element of which the Nioh series makes a great show. The contents of the new edition For an in-depth study and in detail of what the gameplay of Nioh 2 is, we obviously invite you to go and retrieve last year's review. Today we will focus on giving an account of what are the fundamental aspects of the game and the small but big differences that you can find in this new edition. It is no coincidence that, in its PS5 version, the complete edition of Nioh 2 is labeled as remastered, but we will return to the technical aspect shortly. What we can confirm now is that the package (whether on PC or console) includes both the base game and all the additional content that has arrived over time, as well as less impactful ones such as consumable items or books dedicated to the various skills, up to to the three main DLCs released during 2020: The Tengu's Disciple, Darkness in the Capital and The First Samurai. This means that for anyone who is in a position to start Nioh 2 now, they will be faced with a load of content that is very close to overwhelming. A dozen different regions, more than a hundred missions, as many twilight versions (a more difficult and better paid alternative to the standard missions), an avalanche of different bosses, four different new game plus with a specific and particular difficulty and such an exaggerated amount of equipment that could take weeks just to familiarize yourself with. For those who don't have the slightest idea of the type of experience we're talking about, Nioh 2 represents the best hybrid ever made between a soulslike and a Diablo-like ARPG. If of the former it inherits a similar structure as regards the growth of the character through characteristics, the possibility of accumulating ~amrita~ to spend to level up and a difficulty certainly not open to everyone, of the Blizzard title it instead recovers the structure based on research and on the serial accumulation of equipment of ever increasing rarity, so as to improve one's build and the effectiveness of one's blows. Overall Nioh 2 is a video game based on the completion of missions within specific and limited maps (therefore without any open world) that it is possible to faceare in different ways and with different rewards. Every time the campaign is completed in a specific mode, it is possible to move on to the next one, thus allowing us to reach new sets and new previously blocked rarities, provided of course that we manage to survive. In addition to the base campaign and those that arrived later and included in the complete edition , Nioh 2 also features another endgame mode: the Underworld. Similar to the abyss of the first chapter, it is a series of more than one hundred floors of increasing difficulty that allow you to continue to increase the loot and the degree of challenge. These elements, also combined with the additional two categories of weapons added in the months and now available immediately, they make the complete edition a truly amazing offer from the point of view of content, even net of a couple of not entirely exciting DLCs and some elements that are perhaps less accurate than the first chapter. Technical aspects Let's come to one of the most awaited aspects of this complete version: how it behaves with the new features dedicated to the technical side. If you have been following the latest news, what has caught the eye of many enthusiasts is the possibility of taking advantage of even more game options. Since its debut four years ago, Nioh has accustomed us to being able to choose between a mode dedicated to graphic quality, which inevitably puts the player in front of a variable frame rate, or otherwise an ~action~ mode, with the aim to keep 60fps as much as possible, while sacrificing something from a visual point of view. This new remastered version of Nioh 2 for PC and PS5 increases the amount of possibilities even more, even going up to native 4K or, otherwise, towards the peak of 120fps. We had fun trying to test all these different options and it's almost a given to say that we opted to delve into this last one. On the other hand, Nioh 2 is not a title that offers extraordinary graphic peaks, but which on the contrary works a lot on the atmospheres, on the artistic side and on some visual choices that raise the level of reproduction of a Japan that is as beautiful as it is deadly. Being able to experience all this with the frenzy of frantic and hyper-fluid action, especially given the genre, can only be an important addition to the experience, which could be worth the ticket price again for those who have already spent hundreds of hours on the work of Team Ninja. To tell the truth, on the PC on which we thoroughly tested this new version, also being able to count on the brute power of an RTX 3080, the game was hardly able to reach and maintain 120fps at 1440p, but we never went below 80, having therefore an optimal fluidity and able to make the most of the Nioh 2 experience. If it is true that this option will make the lovers of frames per second happy, we are sure that the intermediate mode, which allows you to set the game at 60fps and being able to also enjoy a resolution up to 4K, could be the solution most appreciated by players. The compromise that will make everyone agree, in the best way and giving a superfine general quality. Speaking of pcists we can also confirm the addition of full mouse and keyboard support, an element that can never be underestimated.", "date": "2021-02-04", "grade": "8.5"}
