The direct consequence is an increase in the characters' hit points which overshadows the shooter's action mechanics and enhances turrets, defenders, doctors and assassins. In truth (despite the presence of other characters in the relevant class ed) there is only one real assassin and it is Wascot, a chubby and very little human ninja, who is more vulnerable than his companions, more difficult to use, but at the same time it is lethal and capable of altering the balance of the game. In any case, the other classes are also markedly differentiated through movement speed, resistance, the weapons in hand, the possibility of paralyzing opponents and obviously the aesthetics. In short, each has a different approach to combat but all can unlock the bonuses on the map and can buy new robots to add to those already competing for the arena. The mechanics of Super Mondey Night Combat in fact include waves and waves of automatons that leave from both bases at regular intervals with the aim of deactivating the shields of enemy structures and thus making them attackable by the players. Bots, like jumpers to climb the map's rooftops, can be purchased with money earned by exterminating everything that moves. Furthermore, at regular intervals, a special station is activated, generally placed in some high and difficult to reach point, which makes the fearsome robot Annihilator available. Who arrives first, and manages to defend the position, can see him lined up on his side with a consistent offensive advantage. The ultimate goal is to shoot down a large luminous ball located in the opponent's base, in a single available mode excluding training, but enemy structures cause extensive damage and therefore robots and doctors are essential. If to this we add defenders in heavy armor, with tons of life points, the collaboration therefore becomes more than necessary, with the units that inflict heavy damage, almost always at very short range, which must be covered and healed during the elimination of the defenders. Unfortunately in random matches such a high rate of cooperation and the chaos that is created between jetpacks, turbos, gravitational springs makes the classic ranged weapons even less useful. The problem is that the shot and the basic mechanics refer to the shooter and if this doesn't work at its best, a minimum of frustration is inevitable, especially for those who thought they were in a multiplayer shooter. In any case, everything is the result of voluntary choices, including not too precise aiming, another stab for low-level characters, which can however be improved through various types of bonuses. An atypical shooter In Super Monday Night Combat there are two types of levels and bonuses, namely those in the game and the permanent ones that are obtained in the external menus. Those in the game, functional to the mechanics borrowed from the multiplayer online battle arena, allow you to buy and upgrade skills, resistance and damage, while the permanent bonuses come from general experience and from prizes, with items that allow you, for example, to increase the aim by a given percentage, or by purchases. SMNC is in fact a free to play title with microtransactions, reachable via Steam, which allow you to speed up the enhancement of your profile. The increase in the level of the character within a game is a fundamental mechanic, obviously linked to the battle arena component of the title, and going up faster than the others guarantees net bonuses. But the difference between the characters is felt even more, in the shooter dynamics, compared to what happens in a hack & slash context and the frustrating situations, with the impossibility of knocking down an opponent even with an enviable aim, are wasted. Furthermore, 5v5 matches result in a high level of disconnections, understandable given the extreme duration of some matches, and the level structure does not allow new players to enter once the game has started. From a technical point of view, an important role is played by the audio which must support an ironic/sci-fi context. Therefore, the commentator who stays generic but gives pathos to the game and is accompanied by special guests who further enrich the speech is fundamental. Music and sound effects then, although not transcendental, are upfficiently imaginative and in tune with the atmosphere of a futuristic arena suspended between sci-fi and student spirit. Unfortunately in technical terms there are no appreciable peaks and the title, qualitatively, remains confined to the mid-range of free to play shooters. The attention to detail also does not stand out with very bad collisions, which often lead to hitting transparent surfaces, and with the characters skating and rigidly colliding against each other. In any case, the title is characterized by vivid colors and does not miss overviews of the pre-game map, a strategic bird's eye view during respawn and special shots for melee moves. In essence, Super Monday Night Combat lets itself be observed and balances the shortcomings with a good variety guaranteed by various effects for the different weapons, special moves, shortcuts to unlock, multi-level combat, dozens of units and transparent surfaces.", "date": "2012-05-04", "grade": "7.8"}
