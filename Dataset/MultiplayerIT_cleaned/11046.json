What about this year's golf simulation from EA Sports? Is he too a champion fighting against himself or a paper tiger compared to the competition? How to improve the best Here we are at the appointment with the annual release of the EA Sports golf simulation dedicated to Tiger Woods. After the real passage of technology from the past to the current generation of consoles which took place two editions ago, the new chapter, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2009, gives more hope in the introduction of concrete innovations in the mechanics of characterization and execution of the shot rather than in addition of any competitions and types of challenges. In the end, a golf simulation has few pretensions from the point of view of the game modes: the major courses, types of competitions and real tournaments are those, a career mode has been present for some time and the possibility of competing with one's own character to be created at will too. The geographies theater of the challenges, from the tee to the hole, have also reached an excellent level of realization, so the important thing will be to seek excellence in what really gives meaning to a game: what can happen in the ~infinite~ that exists between those two fixed points. Who has the Courage to Aim for Perfection? Let's discover news and changes in order, and let's allow ourselves a premise: Tiger Woods '09 introduces features that clearly exceed the scope of a simple update of the previous title. The shooting has been impeccably finished: next to the classic three-touch button mode with loading bar, with the running marker to be stopped precisely in two points (one adjusts the strength and one the precision), we find the possibility to carry out the movement with the left analog. In this second variant it is now possible to observe a display of the gesture we perform on the stick directly in real time, as the movement of our thumb will appear traced in the form of a colored trail on the ball-shaped icon on the hud. Finally we can immediately notice a possible mistake and why we made it, and correct it within a few shots. This visual feedback is useful for making a precise shot, but in order to make the perfect shot, we need to ensure continuity in the shot gesture made by our golfer, which the more regular and fluid it is, the more the quality of the result is increased. For each shot, even if the preparation routine is always the same - choice of club, positioning of the circle indicative of the maximum landing area of the ball, choice of angle of the shot - the necessary sensitivity and concentration required by analog shooting makes it worthy of your full attention and never taken for granted. It will then be possible, without exaggerated retouching, to influence the curvature of the ball once in flight, as well as lengthen its trajectory by repeatedly pressing a key. Thanks to the new Club Tuner feature - which gives us the possibility to modify the characteristics of a club to adapt its properties to our shooting style - if our movement always tends to deviate excessively to the left or right, a slight tuning of the club will lead to the correction, until it is eliminated, of our possible tendency to error. Good choice: the game adapts to our body as much as we adapt to the control tool, instead of turning everything that does not meet the expected standard of execution into defection. Furthermore, having the possibility of being able to customize the clubs provides us with another tool to significantly improve the quality of our performances. A sour note regarding the dynamics of shooting we find at this point only in the putt: if its preparation is satisfactory at the time of calculating the slope lines, less is the execution, really too simple to carry out successfully. The number of previews of the shot, not available at the highest difficulty, is however only one. In a sense, it is every mistake in the shot that now causes fewer unwelcome consequences than in the last edition, but the balance between the effort required and fun, putting aside, has been achieved with gratifying accuracy. From budding promises to new ones camps Also in this edition you can create your own golfer, physically characterizing him as we please, even using your image through the Photo Game Face system. We will start the career mode with an amateur preparation, but it will be possible to be trained directly by Hank Haney, Woods' personal coach, and increase the skills of strength, precision, pitch and putt by participating in a series of challenges and winning them. This dynamic skill management system is really welcome: being at the top of the rankings will above all be the result of your commitment and no shot will end up being underestimated, given that every mistake will cost you a slight lowering of the values. An ingenuity of the system lies in being easily exploitable to our advantage, in fact by continuously practicing the simplest holes we will easily raise our skills, even if in any case it will always be about time spent practicing. Still on the management of values, a forgettable feature is that of the Pro Shop, where it is possible to buy equipment and clothing to increase our statistics. Although useful for those who just can't progress in training, it is a surreal feature to find in a simulation: a black hat instead of a white one hardly becomes credible in making a difference like the much discussed hyper-technological costume sported by swimmers could have done at the last Beijing Olympics. The most important international paths are obviously almost all there, even if unfortunately the limit remains at 28 since five have been removed to make room for another new five: at this point we hope not to see paid downloadable ones arrive too soon , as happened last year. The classic PGA tournament mode is accompanied by a fair variety of instant challenges (connected to GamerNet), fun alternatives to spice up the standard match, and the Tiger Challenges, duels halfway between training and a bet (but from vague resemblance to a collage of tutorials) useful for raising our statistics and earning money. The roster of champions present includes some of the greatest men's and women's champions on the world scene, from Adam Scott to Anna Sorenstam, and we will be able to compete against them, but unfortunately without being able to skip their plays which we will have to observe in full. The fields have been well reconstructed thanks to the graphic complexity allowed by current technology, but we would really like to see that well-defined nature more alive, and the weather conditions, especially the wind, more visible. The faces and animations leave something to be desired, but we don't want to be so fussy and look where it's not so important to do it. The GamerNet online component? It really needs to be said: it's in the game, everywhere. The team's choice to make it so pervasive is really right, each section of the game includes it and derives particular benefits from it. One has the feeling that one is truly participating in a world-class career, personal as a player and simulated as a golfer. When we are back from the tee, data on the performance of other players on that particular hole will appear, such as the maximum distance traveled from the tee. During the courses we will also be able to participate in different instant challenges, really tasty, to superimpose different levels of challenge at the same time. Finally, the game for four players at the same time has been optimally implemented in the multiplayer, i.e. everyone can make their own shot without waiting for turns as the opponent's shots will be shown directly by colored arcs that correspond to the trajectories of their balls: game quality and speed will they will ensure hours of fun with your companions. By the way, one last note: you know the excited ~In your LIFE, have you ever seen anything like THAT!~ howled by the TV commentator when Tiger Woods scored that miraculous hole in Augusta in 2005? If only the commentators got half as excited now and then, we could forgive them for being incredibly soporific the rest of the time, not to mention inattentive to what's going on.", "date": "2008-11-18", "grade": "8.5"}
