{"name": "Quantum League", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/quantum-league-recensione.html", "text": "Bringers of ideas, it is difficult for independent games to explode on the market as they deserve at launch. It is a situation that has been repeated several times in recent years and if the question does not represent an insurmountable problem for purely single player games, for those where competitive play is the core of the experience the situation changes drastically. In the context of competitive shooters, in particular, having the servers full at launch with players who flock together in joy and fill forums and thematic channels with discussions and clips is essential and, more and more often, it happens instead that lack of popularity leads to death incredibly interesting paper projects. We have seen it with Bleeding Edge, with Rocket Arena and also with Lawbreakers, just to mention the first ones that come to mind, respectable games with triple A funding that have been able to do nothing against the community's disinterest. Therefore, deciding to throw yourself headlong into this market segment essentially means two things: either you are completely crazy or you are so sure that you have a winning idea in your hands that the risk becomes calculated. Nible Giant Entertainment, in our opinion, lies in the middle of these two things because if it is true that the idea is undoubtedly stratospheric, as well as the realization to think and imagine a video game of this kind a more than a pinch of madness must hover in the minds of developers. Let's see how our test went in the Quantum League review. The gameplay you don't expect Quantum league is insane and as we played it for this review we were wondering how on earth to be able to explain it to you without freaking out. The almost cartoonish visual impact beyond Overwatch and the essential arenas suggest that you have in your hands the usual independent experiment without too much art, released on Steam to capture some arena shooter enthusiasts and be satisfied with this. However, when you take up your rifle and go down into the arena, even just for the (little) explanatory initial tutorial, you immediately realize that behind that light aspect there is an idea that to define brilliant is an understatement. What appears to be a trivial team arena shooter transforms in a few moments into a devastating one-on-one shooter where knowing how to shoot undoubtedly counts but is only a marginal part compared to intelligence and strategy. Once you have chosen your champion, you will therefore find yourself catapulted into a PvP battle where you will simply have to try to eliminate your opponent before he does the same to you. To do this, only twenty seconds available in a fight that turns out to be frenetic and fun, just right in a far west duel where whoever shoots first manages to fire twice. It is at the end of these twenty seconds that Quantum League will completely upset you, restarting the stopwatch and putting you directly in a team with your ghost, who will exactly retrace all the movements of the previous time loop always obtaining the same result. The deathmatch mode is definitely the most fun Here things start to get interesting because your task will therefore become twofold: you can decide to aim at the head of your current competitor, also now catapulted into the second loop, or eliminate the ghost of your opponent from the first loop before he kills the your copy of the past. Twenty seconds and the loop rewinds again making you repeat the fight for the third time, adding more and more variables in the game and making Quantum League a game of pure strategy, in a nutshell a wonderful example of how to revolutionize a genre. Once the third loop is over, the fallen per faction will be counted and the winner of the battle will be decreed. Difficult to play even more to explain With the grenade spam in the first loops the matches become a real hell Being able to understand the game mechanics is not at all simple in a few text characters but trust us when we tell you that we find this title something absolutely fresh and new in the panorama and that we hope will be able to achieve success perhaps, perhaps by refining many things which still make you turn up your nose a little during the journey. In addition to the deathmatch mode (1 against one or two against two) there is also a conquest mode and a sort of relay to capture specific areas but both did not seem so exciting to us, with the aggravating circumstance that making them end up in a draw by keeping always under fire the hot areas is extremely simple, for a tie result that tends to last for very long series of loops, almost getting boring. Even the weapons didn't look like balance sheetsvery exciting, although there are only five, with a freely selectable grenade launcher at the beginning of the match, ready to ruin the fun if more players start spamming explosive bullets during the first loop, then making all the following ones unplayable. Not too serious errors but smudges that did not allow us to appreciate all the modalities in the same way. Getting angry with other selves in a team is a mystical experience! It is also difficult to understand the launch strategy with a standard price set at just under 10 euros but reduced to five for the first few weeks, a strange choice given that aesthetic microtransactions of all kinds are hidden within the title from the skins for the characters, which, however, do not alter the passive skills, to the emotes up to the models revisited by rarity.", "date": "2021-04-21", "grade": "7.8"}
