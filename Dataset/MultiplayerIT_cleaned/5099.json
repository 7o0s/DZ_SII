{"name": "Allarme a Borgrovia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/178374-deathtrap-allarme-a-borgrovia.html", "text": "Freshly arriving on Xbox One for free with January's Games With Gold, World of Van Helsing: Deathtrap is a hybrid between tower defense and hack & slash, a spin-off of the Incredible Adventure of Van Helsing series that has been available for a couple of years on Steam. Unlike other similar games, the title of the Hungarian software house NeocoreGames brings into play all the typical elements of a hack & slash with the evolution of equipment, skills and traps. The result is something special, less balanced than a pure tower defense can be, but certainly richer in terms of mechanics. World of Van Helsing: Deathtrap returns to the field on Xbox One, riding the Games With Gold in January The best defense is offense The core of the experience is the classic one of action tower defense, with a hero who must defend a base from hordes of enemies who travel along pre-established paths along which there are positions on which the player can mount all kinds of defense devices . Our obvious task is to make the most of all our resources and the essence necessary to build traps in order to avoid too many enemy creatures reaching our base, destroying it. The first thing to do is to place the traps in the crucial points, those where the greatest number of enemies is more likely to pass, but given the complexity of some maps it is not always easy to identify the most vulnerable areas. And it is precisely in the weak points that our direct intervention is urgently needed in the role of one of the three available heroes, each of whom, thanks to the hack & slash dynamics we mentioned at the beginning, can choose, by leveling up, among over fifty pretty useful skills. Some are exclusively for attack and have immediate use, but those that most influence the progress of the game are those of support which, in addition to enhancing the defenses, can increase the essence obtained by fighting. Always useful, the hero becomes an essential element when the bosses take the field who, in addition to having elite enemy characteristics, can count on skills capable of paralyzing our traps. The task of reactivating them always falls to the hero who, among other things, can be chased by some creatures by dragging them into an area targeted by our traps. In these cases, the risk is that of dying and wasting precious time, but the risk decreases by wisely exploiting cooldowns, shrines and a good placement of traps. Initially the arrangement of the defensive mechanisms is quite simple, with only one type of trap for each station and no upgrades available, but things are bound to get complicated as the number of devices grows to reach a maximum of 25. Taking these into account factors, in normal mode the difficulty is not very high, thanks to the healing potions and the energy that recharges quickly once out of combat. For this reason, we advise those looking for a challenge to start from the difficult setting that forces us more often to deal with emergency situations. Sometimes the problem is related to insufficient defensive measures, sometimes to the type of trap that can be useless in the case of flying enemies, too vulnerable as happens to archers if the enemies cross it or more or less effective depending on the specific resistances which of the forty types of enemies, divided into three races, is walking the way. Xbox One goals Getting the thousand points offered by World of Van Helsing: Deathtrap is not easy. Several objectives simply require patience, a lot in the case of the one that asks us to kill 100,000 creatures, but there are many that require a deep knowledge of the game, necessary to conquer all the four maps with the maximum rating and essential to pass one scenario on maximum difficulty without dying. Does too much stuff? Some maps are small puzzles, others are decidedly large, probably a little dispersive and not perfectly balanced but capable of enhancing the hack & slash dimension which also manifests itself in the presence of creatures that do not attack our base but can be tracked down and killed as the waves of enemies assault us. Reaching and defeating them can distract us from the defense for long, endless moments but can bestow some extra loot in addition to the guaranteed chests that await us once the map is completed. The other peculiarity of the bigger maps is that they evolve significantly after each wave, due to the activation of new portals that allow enemies to approach the base from different pathsthe. The progress pattern is also visible between one wave to another, which allows us to plan, upgrade or modify the traps calmly, but in some cases it is necessary to intervene on the defenses in the middle of an attack and the need to approaching the traps with the character to be able to modify or install them can make the matter rather complicated. In these situations it is essential to take advantage of the teleportation portals that allow us to quickly return near the base or a nerve center to lend a hand in case of emergency. The more the difficulty rises, the more weighted movements become important although a large part of the challenge depends on the evolution of the character which includes crafting, artifacts and important synergies between pieces of equipment, traps and skills. And a system that works, strong in high customization and full of secondary effects such as the knocking down of enemies and other effects that give us precious seconds. Yet the gameplay is bound to get repetitive, probably due to imperfect balancing, predictability of enemies and old-fashioned hack & slash gameplay, made even more difficult by an imperfect console adaptation that deprives us of the editor and makes it absurdly complicated move between portals. Furthermore, although the atmosphere is successful, the soundtrack is spot on and the graphics are still more than sufficient, the plot is specious, a mere extension of that of the main chapters of the series, while the characters, although significantly different from each other On the other hand, they lack originality and characterization. Of the three, the most successful is undoubtedly the hunter, not only because he is the most versatile but because, being similar to the figure of Van Helsing, he guarantees a little more involvement than the others. This does not mean that someone may prefer the resistance of the mercenary, useful for curbing enemies by exploiting melee, or the power of the enchantress, but it is really difficult to want to take the pad back once the campaign is completed, which it lasts at least seven hours on normal difficulty, provided you don't appreciate the survival mode or don't resort to multiplayer which offers a quality four-player cooperative which is counterbalanced by a competitive mode that is unfortunately unbalanced and limited to a single map.", "date": "2017-01-05", "grade": "7.0"}
