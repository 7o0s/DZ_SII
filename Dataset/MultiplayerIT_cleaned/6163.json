{"name": "Paura del buio?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/153784-feist-paura-del-buio.html", "text": "Feist's prototype came into the world way back in 2008 and was in some way a forerunner in terms of an increasingly widespread and decidedly effective visual style. Unfortunately that prototype didn't become a real project until 2013, when the two Swiss developers Adrian Stutz and Florian Faller, driven by fan requests, decided to found Bits & Beasts and convert Feist into the debut title of their software house. It took a long time for it to happen but finally Feist arrived at his destination A dark forest Feist is a suggestive platformer that, like the famous Limbo, plays with shadows and doesn't need dialogues or texts to tell us its story. Feist's world is dark, a dark forest full of pools of hostile creatures, tilting logs, mobile objects and mushrooms to be exploited to overcome filthy creatures and to reach the highest branches which are often essential for overcoming the most impressive heights. But there is a more treacherous obstacle that can become lethal in the case of fights and this obstacle is the slime that impedes the movements of the furry protagonist and can become a big problem during fights. If the extreme contrast between the background and the objects in the foreground makes everything clearly visible and identifiable, the mud cannot be seen due to the dark uniformity of the ground above which only the silhouettes of large trees and whatever stands in our way rise or protects us as in the case of mushrooms and hollow trunks. Fortunately, the monsters enjoy a greater albeit weak lighting and this allows us to admire a decidedly high level of detail between supple quills, hairy thugs and soft masses that roll in our direction when solicited. But even when the only thing illuminated is the background, the attention to detail allows us to enjoy subtleties such as the hair of our character, the turf, the darts stuck in the ground or the imperfections and cracks of a large hollow trunk. Furthermore, the title sports animations that, although not particularly complex, are decidedly fluid and give us, in combination with a simple and reactive control system, a smooth and elegant action. The character is light, when he jumps he floats in the air benefiting massively from inertia and this means that even the most insignificant run-up can be decisive while a single misstep can lead us into unpleasant situations. On the other hand, as we said earlier, mud significantly reduces the mobility of a protagonist who often finds himself hunted by decidedly dangerous creatures. Sometimes overcoming an obstacle requires you to carefully examine the area to find an object or a handhold that allows you to reach a high position and then the goal with a mighty jump, but there are almost no real Limbo puzzles trace. Physics is important and is also exploited in some situations which include tilting tree trunks, rolling boulders and the exploitation of strange thorny fruits to create handholds but these are easy to understand situations, designed to embarrass only with the addition of monsters, avalanches and assorted dangers. The action, in essence, is the host and the real challenge lies in the clashes that are difficult, sometimes long and often desperate. Not your usual platformer Some enemies simply react to our presence while others are intelligent, charge, wait, are able to flush us out and throw everything they find, including the protagonist. However, they do not pay attention to traps and these are often the key to overcoming seemingly insurmountable situations with the weapons available. Stones, pine cones, sticks and jumps can help us and in some situations they are essential for neutralizing certain enemies but they are not always sufficient to face often uncoordinated and brutal fights. The beings that inhabit the world of Feist, part monsters and part animals linked to a dark and hostile nature, are robust and menacing, increasingly numerous, sometimes difficult to kill with the simple weapons at our disposal and in many cases capable of chasing us without stop making every wrong jump a death sentence. After the first placid levels, the disparity of forces can become overwhelming and it is good to always keep in mind every possibility, including that of using some creatures to our advantage, taking them up as weapons or exploiting them to reach otherwise inaccessible places. Finally, to make things even more difficult, there is no visual interface and this means that it is not possible to follow the state of health of the protagonist who could be in great shape or tragicmind close to departure. The difficulty, in essence, is high but the mix of brutality and frustration, fortunately seasoned with checkpoints in quantity, is what makes Feist intense and worthy of attention, beyond the possible liking of the visual setting, in a genre by now literally crammed with rich, magical and often innovative experiences. Too bad for the short duration and for some problems that are not always negligible. For example, we have seen our character die from a trap that has already been triggered because it has not been activated in the way intended by the developers. Furthermore, the random placement of monsters combined with the high difficulty can put us in front of improbable challenges. Finally the weapons break and when they finish it happens to be forced to load a checkpoint in the impossibility of continuing. In short, we are not faced with a perfectly balanced experience even if we can still say that the long development of Feist has brought him where he wanted to go. The atmosphere, thanks to the suggestive and melancholic soundtrack signed by the Polish composer Tomek Kolczynski, is certainly not lacking and the action can give enormous satisfaction both in terms of challenge and in terms of emotional charge. The fairytale world, the peculiar visual style, the deep tunnels that I force us to wander in a continuum of chiaroscuro and the violence of a merciless nature interpenetrate, balance and contrast, bringing us something very particular although devoid of real innovations .", "date": "2015-07-27", "grade": "7.5"}
