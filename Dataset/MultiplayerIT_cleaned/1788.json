{"name": "Frank Herbert's Dune", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frank-herberts-dune_a.html", "text": "Metal Dune Solid Indeed this is not the first title dedicated to Herbert's work, the PC toy library has already been monopolized in the RTS (Real Time Strategy) field by various games based on the Dune universe; however, this new product mocks the Unmentionable Konami mega-production, at least in the gameplay... In fact, Dune is a third-person action-game that requires considerable strategic skills and a lot of discretion from the player: mostly, the action phases that will characterize the missions in which the game is divided, will see Paul committed to infiltrating enemy bases, eliminating soldiers by surprise with his Krys (the Fremen war knife) and solving some simple puzzles to gain access to the next mission. Nonetheless, Dune is packed with nice touches that expand the depth of the gameplay. To begin with, it must be said that the classic vital energy is represented by a container of water: this will go empty during the action, and can only be filled by carefully distributing extra ~charges~, or by killing with the Krys i enemies. The Krys, by the way, is not the only weapon at Paul's disposal, as as the game progresses, new and lethal firearms will be obtained, not to mention the fearsome Bene Gesserit power of the Voice, capable of paralyzing enemies (basically, a kind of psychokinesis). Paul is controlled in a simple and intuitive way, just act on a very small number of keys to aim, spy around corners, point and shoot, shoot from one corner to another and so on... Note that between missions and the other, Paul will have free access to the Sietch Fremen (the base of operations, in short) to be able to dialogue with other characters (including the Abominable Alia, his sister, a two-year-old girl possessed by the consciences of countless ancestors), acquire new items and information on subsequent missions, like in a real adventure game. In short, a hybrid action game, but definitely intriguing ... affected by the tie-in syndrome, or monotony: Dune is boring and frustrating in the long run, the few game levels are united by very similar objectives and situations that entice the player to continue only to enjoy the excellent plot that is the background to the adventures of the young heir of the Atreides. All La Spezia's fault Technically, Dune is a more than discreet product, undermined only by a decidedly approximate management of the cameras. Graphically, Cryo has created extremely detailed and realistic polygonal models, with clean and accurate textures, equipped with fluid and convincing animations. Perhaps just a little too ~plasticky~, but basically of excellent workmanship. The same should be said for the settings, very accurate and excellently texturized (even if something more could have been done for the sand, the true protagonist of Dune); however, it is a pity that they soon fall into a rather annoying conceptual and stylistic monotony: we find ourselves facing internships that everyone knows we have already seen, structured in the same way and very little original. As we said, however, the real problem of Dune are the cameras: leaving out that if their management is left to the discretion of the artificial intelligence, the algorithm soon ends up going crazy framing the action in preposterous ways (and we could mention candid-camera bug, where the camera is positioned in Paul's head, with annoying disappearances of polygons and textures), manual management could prove to be even worse, as the response to inputs entered by pressing the backbones is slow and imprecise, with some resistance, by the default camera position, to making sudden and unjustified reverse shots. A real thorn in the side, for a game that was, from an aesthetic point of view, truly enjoyable. As far as the sound aspect is concerned, discrete but monotonous music and sound effects that are all a bit the same make the hearing experience decidedly banal; luckily, the excellent American dubbing and, for once, a more than good Italian dubbing, do justice to the most mistreated aspect of this contradictory product... Comment Frank Herbert's Dune was an excellent opportunity for the most beautiful sci-fi saga ever conceived to grab a much larger slice of videogame users, especially the console one (this Dune is a PC conversion), unaccustomed to the abused RTS genre based on this renowned license. A miserable failure or an unsuspected success? Neither one nor the other. Dune turns out to be a titothe only discreet, a half-successful action-game, undermined by a conceptual monotony that affects both the technical aspect and that of the gameplay, modeled along the lines of illustrious productions already cloned in the past with poor results. However, the effort infused by Cryo in the visual implementation of Dune is appreciable, which despite the annoying bugs related to the cameras turns out to be very pleasant. A video game, however, is not made up of graphics alone, and this Frank Herbert's Dune is yet another confirmation. Pros: It's Dune, it has the story of Dune, the characters of Dune, the brilliance of Dune. That's enough. Above average graphics. A gameplay with some particularly innovative ideas. Cons: Outrageous framing bug. Monotonous in appearance and concept. Few levels, too many similarities. ~The future is a time of great change.~ With this statement by Princess Irulan, back in 1984, the controversial film adaptation of the first chapter of Dune came to life on the big screen, a literary exalogy born from the brilliant mind of the anthropologist Frank Herbert almost thirty years earlier. Last year, then, to satisfy the fans who were disappointed by Lynch's brilliant and particular scenic inventiveness, a television miniseries was produced based once again on the first episode of the saga, which thanks to over six hours of production managed to narrate in much more detail the over four hundred pages of the novel (in fact, the two and a half hours of Lynch's production were tight for him), gratifying the viewer with current and highly sophisticated special effects. Too bad that the acting of the actors present is trampled by the skill of the various McLachlan and Stuart of the previous adaptation, but that's another matter ... For those who are wondering why the name ~Frank Herbert~ is prepositioned in the new title, let's make a dutiful clarification: this gentleman is not exactly any writer, Herbert is responsible for the creation of a science fiction universe of a complexity, a wealth of details, an originality unparalleled in the international literature of all time, comparable only to the fantastic world conceived by Tolkien, the author of the famous The Lord of the Rings. Do you think that George Lucas, by his own admission, confirmed that without Dune, his much more famous Star Wars would never have existed. Writers such as Asimov and King were inspired in form or themes by the works of Herbert (who, however, did not limit himself only to the creation of the Dune universe), which with his death, about twenty years ago, produced a truly unbridgeable... But let's go back to Dune, nickname of the desert planet Arrakis, disputed in 10191 by the most important imperial families of the galaxy, such as that of the Atreides and that of the Harkonnens, unaware pawns of the far more ambitious conquest project of the Padish Emperor Shaddam IV and the Guild of Space Navigators, in turn mere puppets of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, a coven of only women dedicated to the forced evolution of the species for the procreation of a perfect being under their control. A plan within a plan, strategies and duplicity, but in the end the following millennia narrated in the hexalogy will be devastated by a single human error: Jessica, the Bene Gesserit wife of Duke Leto Atreides, will generate a son for her husband's sake ( despite the prohibition of the Sisterhood), Paul, our protagonist (as well as the protagonist of the first novel, from which this game is inspired). But what makes Arrakis/Dune so special? Why do so much power and ambition gravitate around this inhospitable planet? The answer is Melange, the spice that gives disproportionate mental powers to those who abuse it... and that will transform the young Paul into the Kwisatz'Haderach, the supreme being, who will lead the Fremen, an ancient and mysterious population of Dune to reconquer the planet.
