{"name": "Hand of Fate 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hand-of-fate-2-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Hand of Fate started out as a sort of underdog in the panorama of computer RPGs, dominated on the one hand by triple A maxi-productions with powerful marketing and on the other by even smaller projects, but perhaps supported by high-sounding names that easily appeal to enthusiasts. In the midst of all this, the first Hand of Fate surprisingly emerged as a title of great interest, capable of carving out a good slice of passionate users both on PC and on consoles with the sole force of its indisputable quality. That was rightly enough for a second chapter to arrive, with the aim of taking up the particular formula of the progenitor and improving it further, representing an evolution in practically every direction of what was achieved with the first episode. After obtaining excellent results on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, Hand of Fate 2 has finally also arrived on Switch, a platform that seems particularly suitable to welcome it in the best way. For a detailed analysis of the functioning and contents of the game, we therefore refer you to the review of the PC version, substantially identical. The fact of not particularly pushing on the spectacular graphics cancels the performance gap between the Nintendo console and its competitors, while the particular narrative mechanic given by the use of the cards also favors a more fragmented use, which can be associated well with the typical portability of Switch; in addition to the fact that the control system has always been particularly inclined towards the use of the controller, rather than more sedentary configurations such as the mouse with the keyboard. From all this it clearly emerges how Hand of Fate 2 is presented at its best on Nintendo Switch, with the only drawback of arriving late by about eight months from the original launch, which could reduce the potential audience, given the long availability on other platforms. A game of cards The peculiarity of Hand of Fate 2 is the same as its predecessor, or rather its being a hybrid between card game and action RPG. Contrary to what one might imagine, given that similar solutions have been found on several occasions on the videogame market, the deck of cards does not have an exclusively combative function, but an actual construction of the story. Anyone who has dealt with classic ~pen and paper~ role-playing games knows well how much of the quality of the gaming experience depends on the ability of the dungeon master, a cardinal element for the success of the narrative component, so indispensable in games of this type. Hand of Fate 2 has a very particular master, namely the dealer, with whom a very strong relationship of closeness and interdependence is established right from the start, being in a certain sense both narrator and co-protagonist of the events. The entire unfolding of the story depends on the extraction of the cards, which unfolds on the basis of what emerges from the elements inside the cards and their arrangement on the game table, which in some respects assumes the role of a sort of chessboard. Contrary to what happens in the cases of standard collectible card games, therefore, here the cards do not have a predominant role in the fight but above all in the arrangement of the events in the story. As explained in the review of the PC version, there are narrative cards that have the function of continuing the adventure and other special ones that come into play to establish the outcome of some particular situations. In both cases, the evolution work done by the developers to vary and enrich this game mechanic compared to the first chapter is remarkable, given that the narrative cards are now deeper and often offer a good amount of choices that lead to forks in the story and sensitive variations in game situations, while the others open up a plethora of different conditions, establishing the chances of success of various episodes, or modifying the unfolding of events in a more sensitive way thanks to the different equipment or the choice of companions to take along in the various missions. Combat and exploration Combining the magic and esotericism of the tarot with the action of a Batman: Arkham-style brawler is a decidedly bizarre thing on paper, but which incredibly succeeds very well in Hand of Fate 2. The Defiant game is eclectic and of the fascinating strangeness its strengths, perfectly managing to create a strong identity in an inflated genre such as that of the RPG. Fate always drives events, at least for a good percentage, but the player's skill lies in selecting the right cards so that he can bet on a certain amount of possibilities.lities in favor of following one's own path. Between drawing cards and throwing dice, the randomness typical of the classic role-playing game remains dominant, but the possibility of strengthening one's position against fate by introducing carefully selected cards turns out to be a fundamental element of the Hand of Fate 2 strategy. The beauty is that the combinations are so vast as to make each gaming experience substantially different and for a certain percentage even personal, dependent on one's choices. In the midst of all this, so as not to rely on too trivial reference points, the game also inserts combat phases that are as actionable as a real brawler, perhaps less successful than other game situations but still well blended and interesting , however, useful to break the pace and keep the interest high. These are not moments to be taken lightly: in fact, it is essential to select the best equipment, considering that the enemies have different strengths and weaknesses and the right choice of weapon, due to intrinsic characteristics or special abilities, is fundamental. The conversion on Switch does not present particular problematic elements, also because the technical equipment of Hand of Fate 2 is not exactly complex to manage, although there are still moments of blockage in the transition from the table and card phase to the combat phase, probably due to loading.", "date": "2018-07-24", "grade": "8.7"}
