{"name": "Fifa Football 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-football-2004.html", "text": "Ten options for me, may be enough From the title of the paragraph I think it is understandable that the ghost that distresses gamers when they hear the name ~Fifa~ also manifests itself in this new episode of the series, you will see why later. Many teams available, in total there are the teams of seventeen championships and related minor leagues as well as national selections and some clubs not belonging to the represented championships. As far as Italy is concerned, the Lega Calcio has not sold the rights to Serie A, this means that the competition logo is not present anywhere, replaced by a shield, and that not all teams are represented under licence. Just to give an example, Sampdoria, Udinese and Bologna don't wear an official shirt complete with sponsors but simply a shirt that recalls the club colours. Apart from this small sour note, the other uniforms have undoubtedly been made with considerable care, so much so that they are indistinguishable from the real ones. Obviously it is possible to play a single game or a tournament, the most interesting option, however, is to face an entire career in the role of manager. Once you have chosen a team, you will be offered a contract that you are required to honour: if you are required to score 1000 points, you will have to achieve a series of objectives (for example, win more than 10 games or have a positive goal difference) which will allow you to achieve that score and, at the same time, be careful not to go too badly so as not to lose the bench at the end of the season. There are many parameters to pay attention to during your adventure: the balance sheet must always be positive, the esteem of fans and clubs must not drop, the transfer market must be followed while the players must always be trained, compatibly with the points available and the your team's commitments. Undoubtedly this is the most accurate part of the game and will allow fans, rather than gamers, to get some satisfaction by winning the Scudetto and defeating the most famous clubs. Network issue The most interesting option, exclusive to the PlayStation 2 version, is certainly the one that allows you to challenge, thanks to the Internet, players who live hundreds of kilometers away from your bedroom. Once registered on the EA Sports site dedicated to online gaming (don't worry, the first time you go online with the game it will be possible to register directly from your PlayStation 2), all you have to do is select a room among those available and search an opponent. In the tests we carried out (internet connection 256kbit in receiving data and 128kbit in sending) we found conspicuous and continuous slowdowns in the game action, especially when creating matches. It went better, fortunately, with matches created by players with faster connections. Dulcis in fundo, during the game you can talk to your opponent: an excellent option, given that a football game lends itself perfectly to teasing. Is there anything to play? Now, some will wonder why we have excluded gamers from the previous reasoning and why this title ... well, simply because the game, once you take the field, explodes like a soap bubble. It's empty. If from a managerial point of view Fifa 2004 stands thanks to a moderate level career mode, from a playful point of view, understood as ~playing football~ rather than navigating through the menus, we are just not there. The action is frenetic and it is impossible to plan attack or defense schemes: the trick is to quickly pass the ball to the free player, before an opposing defender comes towards you. Great force you will say, even in reality football matches are played following these principles. Of course, however, the difference is that in reality, but also in Pro Evolution Soccer 3, it is possible to plan the passes, set up sensible actions, try to beat the man with fine plays and more. All of this in Fifa 2004 is so impossible that on the pitch the game of football is reduced to very rapid passes, slide interventions worthy of the worst butcher and continuous shots on goal. The goalkeeper situation is dramatic: once they arrive in the penalty area, in front of the goal, it is almost impossible for the attacker to make a mistake by sending the ball wide, or for the goalkeeper to make a save. It is therefore not infrequent that matches end with results that are suitable for matches in another sport: tennis. I like the possibility ofchoose where to hit the ball during free kicks, too bad the interface is far from intuitive and scoring a goal requires a lot of experience. It is useless for me to tell you about throw-ins and setting up corners as well as the possibility of changing tactics during the match because these are details that do not add value to a low-level gaming experience. Playstation 2 vs Xbox Being a cross-platform title, it is reasonable to expect very few differences between the various versions. In fact, the Xbox version compared to the PlayStation 2 version offers a shred of more graphic cleaning and much faster loading. Conversely, the PlayStation 2 version offers an exclusive online option that tips the balance on its side, provided you're in a position to take advantage of a broadband internet connection. The technique We are not aware of what the goals and ambitions of the development team graphics were, unfortunately I can announce that the result achieved is, in our opinion, of a low level. Mind you, at a first superficial glance the graphic impact is remarkable, but when you decide to analyze the details, the Electronic Arts title shows a significant amount of macroscopic defects. First of all, the white outline around the players is inexplicable: it almost seems that the players have a light perpetually focused on them, in certain shots even our men are half white. Speaking of the animations, though, it's a shame to see players running weird, like Charlie Chaplin in the Tramp. To cover a field of about one hundred meters, the players take hundreds of steps with a frequency that frankly appears completely out of normal values, so much so that the movements seem accelerated just like in the films of the 30s. In defense of the animation sector, it is the large quantity of ~outline~ frames to the game action is worth noting: for example, when the referee blows his whistle for a limitless penalty, the players protest in a very convincing way. The similarity of virtual footballers with the real namesakes is remarkable for the top teams at an international level. If you cheer for a minor team by mistake, forget about being able to recognize your favorites. The sound, on the other hand, seems to be the most well-finished aspect of the game: the commentary, even with all its flaws (and bugs, given that every so often from the mouths of Longhi and Galli, official commentators of Fifa 2004, totally meaningless sentences come out in the context of the action in progress) is probably the best ever to appear in a football title. The chants, personalized from team to team and present in massive quantities, are very convincing, and turning up the volume of your TV will catapult you into the middle of a grandstand. Among the music on the menus, one cannot help but mention, among many others, the very famous song ~Ja Sei Inamorar~ which will accompany you in choosing the options. Comment We have already said it in the body of the review but we gladly reiterate the concept also in the space reserved for comments: Fifa 2004 is a game designed for fans. The possibility of using your favorite team in a career to lead them to win the championship will fill young and old with joy in love with the most beautiful game in the world. However, it is wrong to combine the word ~gamers~ with the word ~fans~. The latter, in fact, will inevitably collide against the lack of depth and the scarce artificial intelligence offered by the EA title. The barely sufficient graphics, despite the initial impact, and a general sound commentary of decent quality, complete the ludic offer of Fifa 2004. What to do? Buy it only if you think Pro Evolution Soccer 3 is too complex: it is the only reasonable reason why I can recommend the purchase of the latest EA effort. The possibility of online play on PlayStation 2 makes the version for the Sony monolith preferable, despite the length of the uploads. If you have a Net Adapter and a broadband connection to the network, please raise the mark by half a point. Pros: Very rich career mode Great choirs Online play (PS2 only) Cons: Playability...playability? Good graphics only superficially PES 3 remains by far the paradigm of the genre Fifa 2004. 2004? Yes, it was the year 1993 when the first episode of the Fifa International Soccer series (now Fifa Football) peeked out on the 16 bits of Nintendo and Sega. What abbhe face should be the tenth chapter of a saga that promises to be infinite, destined to accompany us until the end of our days. Well, gamers are always looking for certainties, this is certainly one of the least gratifying ones but it's still better than nothing. Of course, if each Fifa were given the same attention as the various Zelda, Mario and Final Fantasy, we could receive a masterpiece every year... unfortunately this is not the case (and it never will be, I think) and what EA has given us for 2004 is the usual, fortunately revised, Fifa that we all know. Let's analyze in detail the two versions, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, arrived in the editorial office.", "date": "2003-11-05", "grade": null}
