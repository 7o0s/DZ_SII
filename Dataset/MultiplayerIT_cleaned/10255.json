To put it simply, it is a ~round~ (literally) of speed (measured in BPM) and variable duration (two beats, four beats, eight beats, etc.), which can also be repeated indefinitely and from which generally starts to insert the audio tracks relating to the other instruments. In the hip-hop genre, in particular, the use of drum loops is a bit part of the ~tradition~, there is in fact a continuous repetition of the entire instrumental sector while the rapper's voice punctuates the rhymes and possible vocalists sing the track. A very quick example to be clear to the end: everyone knows the song ~Every breath you take~, a timeless classic by the Police. Well, in 1997 the rapper Diddy (at the time known as ~Puff Daddy~) took up the guitar line and the rhythmic part in the form of a loop to put together the song that actually made him really popular with the general public, ~I 'll be missing you~. And it is precisely on the concept of loop that the gameplay of Beat It! is based, an atypical rhythm game developed by GLU for iPhone and iPod Touch. Headphones required Through five locations, each divided into different stages, Beat It! asks us to decorate the scenario by getting the connotation of the loops right as fast as possible. What is all this about? Simple: the game lets us listen to a loop and presents us with a table made up of four quarter notes, within whose boxes we have to identify the beats. The table is divided horizontally by tracks, and as you continue in the career mode these increase in number to reach a maximum of eight different percussions. Bells, tambourines, sticks, etc. are therefore added to the normal components of a battery. When we get the jokes right, they start to sparkle on the screen and their quick arrangement earns us bonuses of various kinds, for example the elimination of a series of unused boxes. It is clear that after some stages the loops become more complex and the instruments become less easy to distinguish, especially if they are cymbals, so you can listen to the audio at any time until the loop is complete. The control system is based exclusively on the use of the touch screen, but unfortunately it doesn't appear as precise as one would expect: the boxes are very small and you often end up selecting one instead of another. However, this is not the only limit of Beat It!, which certainly achieves the goal of bringing some innovations to the rhythm game genre but which in terms of gameplay looks more like an exercise than a video game. Identifying sounds and jokes can be interesting for the first few minutes, but the fundamental playful components to make the experience fun are missing: the player's skill is practically not called into question, nor is the strength of the rhythm actively used as happens in the vast majority of products of the same kind. To play it is absolutely necessary to use earphones: relying on the discreet speakers of the Apple device returns results that are anything but precise in identifying the sounds. You play that in Beat It! they are of really good quality and overlap each other cleanly, without distortion and moving along the tracks of a sophisticated and robust audio engine. The beats are enriched by piano arrangements that create very pleasant and catchy real musical pieces, but which are not interactable like percussion or synthesizer sound effects. The graphic sector stands out for its simple but captivating style. The tested version is 1.0 App Store links", "date": "2010-01-13", "grade": "7.0"}
