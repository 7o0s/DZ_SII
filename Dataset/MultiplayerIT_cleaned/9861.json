With Need for Speed World, Electronic Arts reproposes the concept so dear to the director of Fast and Furius, transporting it, however, into a permanent multiplayer world in which players from all over the world face different tracks created between neighborhoods and alleys, evading the police and obviously customizing the their cars with dozens and dozens of spare parts and ornaments. Valuable feature of the title is the possibility to download the game client for free from the EA site. However, be careful that this does not mean that the game is completely free: what is in fact found in the approximately 800MB of the download is, more than a complete title, a gigantic demo that allows access to most of the in-game contents, while to try really all the possibilities offered you will have to perform micro transactions to get new cars, new upgrades and new graphics with which to decorate the racing cars. In essence, a player with the smooth version will hardly ever beat one who has spent money to buy a faster car or a better upgrade. Currently the most recommended version to enjoy a good compromise between actual gaming experience and economic value is the 19.90 euro Starter Pack, the same tested for this review. I want a life like Steve McQueen Once you download the game client and complete the registration, you are immediately introduced to the purchase of your first car, to then be launched directly into the online fray between non-player vehicles and real-life racers. The gaming experience in Need for Speed World, if we exclude the fundamental exploration of the city to discover its most secret meanders, is essentially reduced to two moments: racing and escaping from the police. We immediately announce that unfortunately the two things are not connected. Contrary to previous titles, in fact, it will never happen that the steering wheels intervene as a third wheel during an illegal race, effectively reducing the confrontation with the police to a single player experience within an online arena. Having said that, to start a race the procedure is quite simple: the starting point is identified on the map and, once there, you join the queue to enter it, waiting for other players to try their hand at the same circuit. Participants can range from three to a maximum of eight, and the rules of the game are quite simple: you run and make the others skid, perhaps causing some suspended pylons to fall on their heads or making them hit civilian cars. Ironically, facing the police is more difficult, indeed, it is more difficult to convince the police to face you; the patrols, in fact, tend to ignore any type of infringement committed in front of them, and only by hitting one directly will you get a tangible reaction. The chases are very similar to what was previously seen in the series: the closest patrols join the first patrol, who can later call unmarked cars to support the police and then begin the climb of the various police ranks present in the USA ( local police, county police, traffic police, state police) who will show up with increasingly massive forces and means. The AI of the pilots, however, does not turn out to be the most successful, and rather than being a danger, the cars behind you will be those that will often and willingly appear in front of you suddenly, trying to bump into you or throw you directly against a wall. Checkpoints also have an uncanny tendency to appear without warning. The same poor tactics used by the agents (forget the contemporary flanking of Most Wanted, here they just come upon you) will be decidedly less dangerous than the sci-fi helicopter that flies over the highways spreading spiked strips around. On the other hand, the possibility of listening to the various radio communications between the steering wheels is always fun, even if made a little more difficult by the lack of localization of the title. Returning to the game experience, once you win (or even simply tackle) a race or a successful escape at high speed, you will get prizes that will be higher the better the result of the race or the damage done to the state during the escape. Rewards vary between fame points, cash, and car power-ups. Through fame you level up, accessing new districts, tracks and cars, while con the money you buy cars and decorations. The upgrades, on the other hand, randomly assigned (the player being able to choose from a series of hole cards which to turn over to reveal what he is hiding) will be able to give new life to the vehicle, providing it with the abused NOS so as to literally make it fly on the ground or even arming it of bolts with which to break through the checkpoints or more resistant wheels and so on. Born to be Wild If the previous paragraph outlines the design of a decidedly arcade and very unrealistic product, don't think badly: it is indeed like this! The major distinctive feature of Need for Speed World is in fact in the total essentiality of the simulation, or directly in its absence. The car is driven with 5 keys (WASD and the space bar) and the numeric keypad instead activates the various upgrades. The gears are automatic. The vehicle reacts very well to every single control, without losing grip regardless of speed or climate and, even, it is possible to maintain very high speeds even after accidents and skids, while the damages are obviously a mere aesthetic problem that has no influence on performance performance of the vehicle. Such an arcade characterization in an online game represents a big problem for the challenges between players, where newbies or those who for reasons of staying online find themselves not having a car that is not exactly at top performance, will find themselves strongly at a disadvantage on those who, on the other hand, have already unlocked or purchased more powerful vehicles, without their possible greater driving ability having a great impact on the final result: in essence, if one car makes 200 and another 190, the first one wins . Graphically speaking we are faced with a product which, despite its online essence and relative fallout in terms of technical possibilities to be exploited, defends itself quite well, offering excellent car models and beautiful effects while maintaining optimal fluidity and minimizing the by LAG. If we really have to look for a fault, it is the city that lacks a bit of dynamism, with few models of civilian vehicles and an absolute lack of pedestrians (no one wants a new carmageddon, however the desolation is really total) and rather anonymous and repetitive buildings . For the record, we point out that during the exploration the cars of the other players will turn out to be incorporeal, so much so that you will pass through them in the event of an impact, which inevitably lowered all the requirements from the server to manage collisions and interpenetrations. making everything smoother. Obviously it won't be like this in the race but in that case it is the narrow area of the track that gives the system a breather and therefore allows for a smooth running of the race.", "date": "2010-08-06", "grade": "7.0"}
