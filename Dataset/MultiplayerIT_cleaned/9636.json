Harry's ~revolution~ therefore involves a greater amount of clashes and dangers than before, which in the game is manifested by continuous fights against enemies. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part I we find ourselves controlling the protagonist in two main situations, among which the levels centered on combat certainly prevail, in which Harry is framed from behind and has to fight with spells generated by the wand against a large number of dark creatures, ~shooting~ just like in war games and, in some cases, alternating attacks to ~cover~ behind various objects in the scenario. The other type of level is characterized by a subjective view, i.e. in first person from the eyes of Harry Potter and is characterized by a greater propensity for exploration and game solutions that we can approach the category of ~stealth~, i.e. titles in which instead of fighting in an unscrupulous way you have to try to get around the enemies with a bit of tactics, to tell the truth here very much reduced to rose water since it is simply required to wear the invisibility cloak and reach the conclusion play areas without being discovered by enemies. Both types of game, although they may be fun and immediate at first, have several problems: the ~shooter~ part is extremely repetitive and is somewhat marred by problems related to framing management, as well as not differentiating the various spells well such as to flatten everything to using a single type of attack to repeat over and over again (stupify!). The part with the invisibility cloak, on the other hand, simply requires you to go from one point to another of the levels being careful not to be discovered, periodically requiring a ~recharge~ of the cloak which can be performed simply by standing still, which of course presents very little fun. As the game progresses, Harry accumulates experience points that allow him to level up and learn and progressively enhance magical abilities. What magic is this? There are therefore obvious problems concerning both the setting of the game - from the controls to the shots up to the management of the enemies - and the structure of the levels, which present practically no variation beyond the fact of going from one point to another. other, crossing various areas in search of objects or simply finding the exit, in the meantime eliminating everything that moves around or simply hiding under the cloak and thus wandering undisturbed. All of this, of course, makes this Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part I not very enjoyable, essentially undermining the fun that should instead be at the heart of the product. In the midst of all this, the graphics with which characters and settings are represented manages, if nothing else, to stand out for a search for quality. Although there are not particularly illustrious points, the characters are reproduced well in the game and the scenarios of the various levels, despite being rather repetitive in certain sections, make a good impression making the aesthetic aspect probably the most positive of the package offered by this Electronic product Arts. The introduction of Kinect is also quite interesting, to which a real game within the game is dedicated, separate from the main story and selectable from the initial menu. Being one of the first experiments with the new Xbox 360 camera, the sector is rather simple, like a sort of shooter with automatic movement in which we find ourselves knocking down the enemies that appear on the screen, however the fact of being able to cast spells with hand gestures is fun and gives a certain satisfaction. Ultimately, the game looks quite good but proves to be uninteresting already in the medium distance, it remains a product recommended only to collectors of everything related to Harry Potter or to the most loyal of the wizard in question. Comment Good graphics Fast and immediate Interesting implementation of Kinect Technical problems between controls and camera Lame levels Repetitive and monotonous in the long run", "date": "2010-11-19", "grade": null}
