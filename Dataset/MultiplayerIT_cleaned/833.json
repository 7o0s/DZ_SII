{"name": "Virtua Tennis: World Tour", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtua-tennis-world-tour.html", "text": "The Grand Slam on the small screen More than a real new chapter, Virtua Tennis: World Tour can very well be described as an updated version of the second (and most recent) episode of the Sega tennis series. The original form and substance have therefore remained almost intact, while the necessary changes have been made to the roster of selectable tennis players, updated with the various Federer, Roddick, Hewitt, Sharapova, Davenport, Williams and others, for a total of 14 athletes equally divided by sex. If this aspect is excluded, Virtua Tennis: World Tour is largely a ~simple~ conversion of Virtua Tennis 2, which however acquires considerable value considering that we are talking about one of the best tennis games ever. The transition to PSP has not altered the excellent gameplay of the Sega title in any way, which above all proposes its characteristics of great immediacy. The only three keys that make up the control system (related to top spin, slice shot and lob) are a clear sign of this, as well as the precision of the tennis player's movements and the absolute feeling of mastery regarding the shots he strikes . Right from the start it is therefore possible to produce precise cut and spectacular balls along the line, without however the risk that the game runs out of its elements of interest after a few games: Virtua Tennis in fact offers a considerable depth, such as to allow the most refined palates to express themselves in delicious plays such as balls to the net and very precise volleys. In short, World Tour is a pleasure to play, and it matters little if the level of simulation offered by the Sega product is not really very high: the exchanges under the net at warp speed are wasted, but the excellent gameplay of the title allows you to easily overlook similar factors. Memories of days gone by As in its older brother Virtua Tennis 2, World Tour features several game options for single player. In addition to the inevitable Quick Match, the Tournament mode - which allows you to face different tournaments by selecting one of the 14 available tennis players -, the section dedicated to the collection of minigames, and the full-bodied World Tour, the spearhead of the version, make a good impression. for home consoles and which returns here in all its glory. It is therefore always a question of creating two tennis players (male and female) and accompanying them in their climb to the top of the ranking, starting from a sad position number 300. This is possible by winning the various tournaments available, which not only bring glory, but also large sums of money to spend in shops scattered around the globe: in addition to a large amount of clothing, the purchasable items also come to new rackets capable of increasing the player's statistics and even playing fields to add to those already available by default. However, the World Tour mode does not end here, also presenting various mini-games that you need to play in order to improve the characteristics of your athletes: divided by category (serve, volley, stroke and run), the mini-games always constitute an interesting challenge, despite during one's virtual career it is necessary to repeat them numerous times to reach the top of the condition. The multiplayer section closes the review of the available modes, open to a maximum of four users via wireless: a real bomb for anyone who has friends equipped with a PSP and a copy of the game. Excellent on the playful front, Virtua Tennis: World Tour absolutely does not disappoint expectations from a technical point of view, offering a graphic rendering in no way inferior to that seen in Virtua Tennis 2 on consoles and obviously enhanced by the splendid PSP display. If we exclude some sporadic slowdown in the sequences that accompany the scoring of a point, the cosmetics of the Sega title is truly valuable, especially as regards the animations of the tennis players. The sound holds up well in the face of the effects and the screams of the athletes, while the background music is - as always - really terrible. Comment While not adding anything new to the series, Virtua Tennis: World Tour is an excellent title, which re-proposes all the winning features of the Sega sports product in a decidedly up to date conversion, which makes good use of the potential of the PSP. Graphically excellent and equipped with the classic stellar gameplay, World Tour is therefore a title strongly recommended to all owners of the Sony handheld, with particular regard to those who also have friends to challenge in exciting multiplayer matches. Pros: Excellent gameplay. Quality graphics. Long lasting and deep. Cons: Avoidable music. Some small lacks here and there Born in the arcade edimmediately converted for the Dreamcast, Virtua Tennis was a surprising title, not only for a truly excellent cosmetics at the time, but above all for an exemplary calibrated gameplay: immediate and intuitive but at the same time capable of giving great satisfaction to those who wanted to go more in depth, the Hitmaker title and its sequel have built their success on these factors. Fortunately, the tradition seems to repeat itself with this Virtua Tennis: World Tour for PSP.", "date": "2005-09-28", "grade": null}
