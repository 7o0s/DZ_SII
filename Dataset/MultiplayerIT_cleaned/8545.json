{"name": "Little Orpheus", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/little-orpheus-recensione-pc-console.html", "text": "It is Russia in 1962 and fellow cosmonaut Ivan Ivanovich is undergoing harsh interrogation by a Soviet Army general, Yurkovoi, because he lost an atomic bomb on a trip to the center of the Earth. Party three years earlier aboard the exploration capsule Little Orpheus, he reappeared out of nowhere without being able to provide a convincing explanation of what happened to him in the meantime and to the precious equipment available to him. Now, however, all he has to do is reconstruct the facts, otherwise he risks being shot for high treason. Too bad that his story is a collage of the absurd that seems to come from an anthology of stories of the fantastic. Will there be anything real? Will it be worth hearing what he has to say until the end? To find out, all you have to do is read the review of Little Orpheus, the latest effort by The Chinese Room. Buy Little Orpheus Little Orpheus was supposed to be available starting March 1, 2022, but the publisher and developer decided to postpone it due to the themes covered, which risked being connected in some way to the Russo-Ukrainian war. We can assure you that the game is practically ready, but there is currently no new release date. All that remains is to wait for official communications on the matter. The new versions The art direction of Little Orpheus is great Little Orpheus, which we had already reviewed in the iOS version (it's available to all Apple Arcade subscribers), is a narrative platformer structured in nine levels (eight form the main story and one is a bonus story), each set in a different place . The novelties of the PC and console versions compared to the Apple Arcade version are practically nil: a higher resolution can be selected, the graphics are slightly more defined and there are also the contents that in the other edition had been added via a post-launch update. There is nothing more. We therefore only have to confirm or disavow what has already been said about the game in the other review, because in terms of ~remastering~ we are faced with a basic job, which does not deviate one iota from the judgment. The main problem with the new versions of Little Orpheus remains the same as the one playable on Apple Arcade (which is essentially identical): it's too easy. The Chinese Room has never been a software house famous for the challenges it offers to players. After all, it is the one that canonized walking simulators with Dear Esther, then replicating with Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. Except that what was tolerable in a first-person adventure, i.e. the complete focus on storytelling and art direction, is much less so in a platformer that occasionally tries to platform, never really succeeding. Sure, the platforms are there, but in the three hours it took us to finish the nine chapters that make up the game (eight standard plus one bonus) we only died twice, just to make you understand how easy it is to get to the end. Even the puzzles are extremely simple and there hasn't been any that has blocked us for more than a few seconds (the time to pull the right levers). Anything that is challenge feels more like a rhythmic variation of the narrative, than an attempt to really engage the player. Which is perhaps also a deliberate choice (indeed, it certainly is), but given the genre, the inconsistency of certain mechanics is inexorably perceived. Not that the game runs badly, given that the levels are beautiful, not so much for a matter of brute technique, as for the artistic direction, really well-kept and very inspired. A delusional world Some landscapes are beautiful It is impossible not to be fascinated by this delusional and adventurous world made up of oceans populated by immense whales and gigantic electric moray eels, forests where tyrannosaurs still live, cities suspended in clouds full of windmills and a Moon struck by an incessant meteor shower on which stands a tower from which the entire stream of human history can be accessed. Little Orpheus, while it lasts, is certainly a great show, also capable of touching on much deeper issues than the lightness of the tones suggests. However, it lacks bite and all the various mechanics, from the mini stealth phases in which you don't have to be seen by some creatures, to the mechanisms to activate, up to the chases with the various enemies, seem to have an almost scenic nature, in their superficiality. The result is a game truly accessible to anyone, able to tell its story smoothly, but which is a bit short of breath in the long run. Sure, the levels can be replayed to collect spheres that yield extra material, but we're just talking aboutsome curiosities to discover and nothing more. Some enemies are gigantic... too bad they're never really dangerous In the end there really isn't much more to explore than what you saw when playing the levels for the first time. Here, if you read it as a hybrid between a walking simulator and Another World, Little Orpheus also makes sense and allows you to enjoy the strange and in its own way compelling story of comrade Ivan Ivanovich from start to finish, without complaining too much about it that is missing or that we would have liked to be present. Just be aware of what you are getting into and the work of The Chinese Room could prove to be a great experience.", "date": "2022-03-05", "grade": "7.8"}
