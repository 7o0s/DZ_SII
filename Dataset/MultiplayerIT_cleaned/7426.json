The story is simple: in an unspecified future the world is practically controlled by a gigantic army of war machines of various types, perfectly organized and apparently unbeatable. However, they have not come to terms with the protagonist of the game, an unnamed hero who alone intends to launch himself into enemy lines, spread destruction in the ranks of androids and reach the core of robotic security systems to bring down the root threat . A simple and effective premise, therefore, to present a series of randomly generated levels with a futuristic setting and progressive difficulty (about 30 in total), in which we find ourselves guiding our super-soldier through a raised and isometric shot and different control systems that ultimately allow you to guide the character in 360 degrees within the levels and shoot everything that moves on the screen. In this regard, there are two substantially different systems for controlling the character: the default one can be easily uncomfortable and not very intuitive for those who prefer to control the action directly, based on the preset automatic fire and indirect control through the ~pointer~, but by selecting the 'alternative option - somewhat recommended - you get a good ~virtual pad~ which allows direct and precise management of the protagonist. It is therefore a third-person shooter with a basic system of contextual covers, in which we are called to go from point A to point B within scenarios composed of simple elements designed to provide covers and give a vaguely futuristic characterization altogether - on the other hand the random construction of the levels necessarily implies a rather simple design of the latter - and occasionally knocking down bosses or completing secondary objectives, in any case without ever deviating from the basic shooter action. In addition to unlocking subsequent levels, the sense of progression is marked by the evolution of the character, who as he progresses through the game obtains experience points to increase his level and skill points to invest in his own characteristics and special abilities, as well as the possibility of buying new weapons and upgrade your arsenal with money collected on the battlefield. Meltdown is a no-nonsense shooter that offers some classic entertainment 'Or sweaty boosted Beyond the simple entertainment given by the action on the field, therefore, the drive to continue in the game also makes use of this important ~role-playing~ component, so to speak, based on the personalization of the protagonist and weapons. To tell the truth, this is not a particularly complex or profound solution, given that the skill tree limits itself to offering a few choices which in general are all selected sooner or later, thus completing all the possible evolutions made available, but that is enough to compact a gaming experience that would otherwise suffer somewhat due to the repetitiveness given by a not exactly inspired level design. The most important variables brought into play by the game are the different types of enemies that we find ourselves facing, with fixed turrets, self-propelled androids and characterized by different attack and defense techniques, which force a certain alternation between the three weapons available to the protagonist, or the two firearms - usually a fast long-range one and a powerful short-range one - and the melee one. In the more advanced levels, a certain familiarity with the use of covers and dodges also becomes necessary, with enemies of different types attacking simultaneously and the need to balance the amount of ammunition and the timing of attacks and reloads. As far as the approach to battle is concerned, however, there is a decidedly different style of play when tackling the levels in cooperative multiplayer: while in single the battle becomes more wait-and-see with greater attention to the defensive phase, in the company of another player it is easier to launch into the open field by attacking with your head down, significantly raising the pace of play and thus proposing a faster and more dynamic mechanic. Although the scenarios do not have particularly flashy elements and suffer somewhat from general repetitiveness, Meltdown looks very good, with a clean graphic styleand well characterized in regards to the characters and enemies. Also noteworthy is a certain reminiscence of the 90s atmosphere, between bright colors and clear outlines, with a soundtrack that seems to come directly from the Amiga's Paula chip.", "date": "2013-12-06", "grade": "7.0"}
