The release in Italian cinemas is scheduled for December 18, but we can already find the video game in stores in the versions for Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS and PC. The film tells the story of a penniless prince, Naveen, who moves to New Orleans in search of good jazz music and a wealthy woman to marry. What he finds on his way, however, is an evil voodoo sorcerer who turns him into a frog. With these new features, Naveen goes in search of a princess who can restore his human form with a kiss and one evening, during a gallant party, he believes he has found her in Tiana. The girl listens to the prince's story and agrees to kiss him, but things don't go the right way: instead of making Naveen human again, the kiss also transforms Tiana into a frog! The two are therefore forced to flee into the swamp, where they meet some characters (the alligator-trumpeter Louis, the firefly Ray) who will help them find human form again through a series of daring situations, in which the action is always accompanied by jazz music. The story upside down As it turns out when watching the film, Tiana is not a princess (that's why her kiss does not have the desired effect!): Naveen sees her dressed that way simply because she is at a costume party. In reality, the girl works as a waitress in the ~Da Duke~ diner, and saves every penny she earns to realize her dream of opening her own restaurant, taking over an old abandoned sugar factory. Well, the Wii version of the game adopts an at least original approach: it begins when the story has already found its ~happy ending~, with Tiana busy organizing her restaurant, and all the friends around to keep her company. By interacting with them, she can ~remember~ the episodes that led her to meet the prince in his frog form, to become a frog herself and to face the voodoo magic of the evil Doctor Facilier, all within five different scenarios: the ~Duke's~ tavern, the costume party, Mama Odie's house, the frog hunters' swamp and the celebrations for Mardi Gras. Each of them is introduced by an animated sequence that faithfully reproduces the style of the Disney film, and which tells us about the events that took place in that place. In the tavern ~Da Duke~, for example, we see Tiana busy preparing a large number of beignets (her specialty) with her boss, Buford the cook, who continually urges her to get busy while he maybe goes to crush a nap. Move your hands! After the animated sequence, each of the scenarios offers us a variable number of minigames (five or six) which take up the situations seen in the film and organize them as if they were competitions between four players. In fact, The Princess and the Frog can be played alone (thus facing computer-controlled opponents) or in company, for up to four players at the same time, each equipped with their own pair of Wii-Motes and Nunchucks. The games are therefore very numerous (about thirty) and generally differ in the type of action that distinguishes them. In the first minigame, ~throwing the puff~, for example, we simply have to hit the dishes of the diner customers by throwing the freshly prepared puffs. The more hits we make, the more points we can collect, with a series of items that are unlocked as we reach high scores and which can be used to customize Tiana's appearance. The games are not all based on skill, however: in the case of the ~Charlotte's Closet~ minigame, what we have to do is watch scenes shown on the screen and remember the characteristics of the clothes worn by the girl, to help her choose the dress to wear. The ability returns to the fore in ~Filky Lanterns~, when Tiana and Naveen, in the form of frogs, escape from the costume party to avoid being captured. At this juncture we have to wait for our character to jump and then press the A and B buttons in the indicated sequence, trying to be as precise and fast as possible. Successfully completing the minigames allows us to renovate Tiana's restaurant as we wish, for example by choosing the colors of the fabrics. Furthermore, at any time, we can replay an already completed challenge or go to the kitchen to prepare delicious dishes through a series of further minigames. A cartoonor interactive The Princess and the Frog amazes with the quality of graphics and sound, which reproduce the style and atmosphere of the Disney cartoon in an extraordinary way. The restaurant and all the scenarios that tell the story of Tiana are very well designed, full of details and distinguished by a skilful use of colours. The characters are beautiful, extremely faithful to the original ones, and are equipped with many different animations. The general result is that of a real interactive cartoon, which will literally drive those who enjoyed the film at the cinema crazy. Everything is further enriched by an amazing Italian dubbing, which boasts the same cast used for the Disney feature film and a truly excellent level of acting. It's just a pity that in some (fortunately few) cases the volume of some voices is too low compared to the others. In conclusion, we are faced with a high quality transposition, which will certainly make the smallest gamers happy. The Nintendo DS version In its portable variant, The Princess and the Frog offers a very different action than seen on the Wii, and tells the story of Tiana following the events of the film in the correct order. It therefore begins with the girl who works at the ~Da Duke~ diner, in a series of very simple small missions that lead to cooking minigames similar in some way to those of the famous Cooking Mama. We have to mix the contents of the pot, add ingredients gradually and pay attention to the temperatures: if they rise too much, we can blow into the DS microphone to lower them. The breath weapon is also used to ~clear~ stages of clutter or cobwebs. However, the real action starts when Tiana and Naveen are forced to face the perils of the swamp in the form of frogs. At this juncture, the game becomes a real platform, while retaining the minigames in which different dishes are cooked. The characters are beautifully drawn, and their animation in particular is smooth and convincing. On a technical level, therefore, the portable version of the game does not make you regret the one for Wii ...
