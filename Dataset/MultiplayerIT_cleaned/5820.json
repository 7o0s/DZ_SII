If the latter owes its name to the rather flourishing historical period in which the game is set, London at the end of the 19th century does not remind us only of great writers and scientists, but also of a figure like Jack the Ripper , which terrorized the Whitechapel neighborhood for months. After freeing the British capital from the cumbersome presence of the Templars, the time has come for Assassins Evie and Jacob Frye to deal with the threat posed by the first serial killer in history, thanks to the first additional content of Assassin's Creed Syndicate released in these hours. Evie and Jacob Frye take on Jack the Ripper in new Assassin's Creed Syndicate DLC The Autumn of Terror The story told by the DLC dedicated to Jack the Ripper takes place above all in the aforementioned Whitechapel district, with a few detours in the City: all the other areas of London known in the base game are therefore closed to us. The 1888 in which the events take place is the year in which the assassin actually killed at least five prostitutes, only to then mysteriously disappear into thin air: within Assassin's Creed Syndicate we find him committed to leaving behind the same trail of death , feeding his figure through the terror aroused by the appalling treatments reserved for his victims. The copious coverage of the newspapers helps to make him a real demon on the loose in the eyes of the citizens, now on the verge of a popular uprising. Given the situation, the authorities ask the Frye twins for help to catch Jack the Ripper, by virtue of his old acquaintance with Jacob: the latter's initial attempt to fix things will fail miserably, leading Evie to go on the trail of the serial killer with the double purpose of stopping him by hook or by crook, and find his brother. As expected, the story of the Frye twins and Jack will intertwine in the revision proposed by Ubisoft, up to threaten the very existence of the brotherhood of Assassins. A story that is told to us through a somewhat darker setting than in the past, characterized by particular dialogues and particularly violent tones: not only for the killings that Jack the Ripper is spreading, but also for the game dynamics based on the terror, completely new compared to what was seen in Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Playstation 4 trophies The arrival of Jack the Ripper brings seven new trophies to Assassin's Creed Syndicate: five of the bronze type, one of silver and one of gold. The latter can be conquered by obtaining total synchronization in the DLC, while the rest of the objectives are mainly dedicated to skills related to the new combat mode. From India with fury The pretext for introducing the renewed combat system of this additional content of Assassin's Creed Syndicate is presented to us in the form of a long period spent by Evie and Jacob Frye in the company of the Indian brotherhood. In fact, the experience allowed the two to learn techniques intended to instill fear in the opponent's mind, to the point of moving away from the battle because completely at the mercy of their own terror. While the twins use these techniques in a non-lethal way, Jack the Ripper fully embraces their destructive potential, producing brutal killings with which to increase his reputation as a serial killer. Immediately set Jacob aside, the DLC actually allows us to also control the man we are hunting, but only in small sections in which the different ~philosophy~ of the character could perhaps have been better exploited. The protagonist is undoubtedly Evie, which turns out to be a fairly well-chosen choice given the high approval rating that the assassin has received since the main adventure. For the occasion, we find ourselves with all the past skills already acquired, flanked by other elements related to terror: for example, we can make sure that more distant enemies see and hear the effects of our beatings against their friends, thus increasing the amount of fear present in their soul. Also included are some nice gadgets, such as a bomb capable of terrorizing enemies and a double tip to be used to leave them screaming and glued to the ground, always to instill fear in others. While the main stream flows over a period of time ranging from threeat four hours, the longevity of the new contents is guaranteed by the presence of new secondary missions, in which to free the brothels of the city or dissolve the boxing clubs by giving them a thrashing to those who are part of them. In conclusion, we can say that the DLC dedicated to Jack the Ripper is appreciated overall, while retaining some long-standing Assassin's Creed problems as a level of challenge capable of creating problems for very few players.", "date": "2015-12-17", "grade": null}
