{"name": "Shadow of the Tomb Raider: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-recensione.html", "text": "It's time to delve into one of the most anticipated games of the year with the review of Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which concludes the (first) reboot trilogy which had the merit of introducing a completely new Lara Croft: at first insecure and inexperienced but at the same time endowed with a tenacity and a determination that made her a world-famous explorer within a few years. The saga, developed in the first two episodes by Crystal Dynamics and delivered for this third chapter to the care of Eidos Montreal, had the aim of reinventing one of the best-known videogame characters, narrating his origins and gradually bringing him closer to the image of the Tomb Raider that we know well: lethal and infallible. This is precisely the concept that is referred to by the title of the game and also expressed by the numerous mercenaries in the pay of the Trinity who are sent from time to time to face it: although still a girl, Lara is not a common opponent and the businesses she has managed to complete they demonstrate it amply. This time, however, the adventurer will have to deal with the pride that inevitably accompanies this type of consecration: having arrived together with the inseparable Jonah at a Mexican crypt that the enemy faction has been looking for for some time, she cannot resist the temptation to steal a dagger that seems to possess supernatural powers. The theft of the relic, in the absence of a mysterious silver casket that should ~complete~ it, causes a series of ominous events that could culminate in the end of the world prophesied by the Maya. In trying to remedy this situation, Lara can't help but feel the weight of the dead and the damage that her rashness has caused. Will he be able to redeem himself? We will find out during an exciting campaign, directed in an excellent way and underpinned by sequences of great visual impact, which are independent of the rhythm of the narration: the tragic phases of the natural disasters to which the protagonist must try to survive, helplessly witnessing so much devastation, the introductory scene on the plane while with Jonah trying to reach Peru, the simple walk among the colorful decorations of the Mexican holiday of the dead, the frenetic escapes in the narrowest spaces, perhaps underwater, with the urgency to take a breath of air, and of course the wonderful discovery of each new tomb, of each new hidden city, of a surprising clue that at a certain point changes the narrative track leading us to visit stations (literally) that we didn't imagine were part of the story. If it's adventure you crave, Shadow of the Tomb Raider won't disappoint you one bit. Environments and structure After the initial part in Mexico, the Shadow of the Tomb Raider campaign takes us as mentioned in Peru, once again in search of a place hidden for centuries, which seems to have to do with the research carried out by Lara's father and which could therefore provide further information on the circumstances of his death. However, the leitmotif of the adventure is the desire for redemption that is triggered after the tragic introductory sequences, and which leads the protagonist to take on a mission that could determine the fate of the world. The structure is the one we know well, with large freely explorable game maps, full of things to do and see. On this front, the developers have tried to insist particularly, pushing us to interact with any character in order to discover the position of places of interest or side missions which, once completed, will allow us to obtain extra upgrades. This type of philosophy actually pervades the game in its entirety: solving the inevitable Challenge Tombs, revealing certain secrets and of course collecting documents, relics and inscriptions around are all elements that contribute to strengthening the character through the release of experience points which is It is possible to spend as soon as you sit around a campfire, dissecting a multifaceted skill tree divided into three areas: Warrior, Explorer and Looter. Difficult to separate one of these souls from the other: in Shadow of the Tomb Raider we will need mixed skills to be able to survive the most hostile environments, improve the effectiveness of the survival instinct and make our attacks lethal in the presence of enemies. Among the innovations introduced in Shadow of the Tomb Raider stand out the possibility of performing killings from tree branches, hanging eliminated opponents, or applying explosive baits to corpses, very useful in terms of a stealth approach, or even unlocking of arrows tolucinogens, which pit the mercenaries of the Trinity against each other for a few moments, lightening our work in the presence of large groups. But let's go back to the settings, which in this episode are essentially oriented towards populousness rather than mere breadth. We will also visit three cities, two smaller and one larger, each with its own challenges, subquests, supporting actors to interact with and a strong taste for discovery, which also on this occasion often takes place by diving and finding hidden passages, through which to reach secret crypts or the tombs we have already mentioned. There are one or more for each area, and they present increasingly complex puzzles, very fun to solve, which revolve around the activation of switches and really interesting platforming phases. In fact, this element starts from the experience gained with Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider to go further, between extreme slopes, dizzying leaps and the unprecedented ability to use the grappling hook even to descend from great heights, taking full advantage of the consolidated verticality of scenarios which are confirmed to be very inspired in terms of design, capable of captivating thanks to suggestive glimpses that on more than one occasion have brought to mind the incredible locations of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. The comparison was clearly inevitable, and we feel like saying that if it is true that Shadow of the Tomb Raider suffers from some shortcomings in terms of balance, duration and enhancement of some mechanics, at the same time it is perhaps the product that comes closest qualitatively to the work by Naughty Dog. The cornerstone is more stylistic than anything else and reveals a strong, coherent, effective vision, which has been materialized in an almost impeccable way by the guys from Eidos Montreal, who do not in any way regret the work done by their Crystal Dynamics colleagues. This is also a nice surprise. Gameplay In a title like Shadow of the Tomb Raider it is natural to firmly connect the mechanisms that characterize the gameplay to the structure of the levels and to the facet of the settings, which play a central role with their secrets, the slopes, the walls to climb, the trees in the forest areas and the airiness of the largest city that we will visit during the campaign. The platform phases have been further improved, starting from the solid foundations built with the previous two episodes to introduce, as mentioned, new abilities for the protagonist and new situations to face, often intertwined with stealth action. The example of the Peruvian jungle is perfect from this point of view: although once again hunting plays an accessory and never fundamental role, it is possible to jump from branch to branch to ambush enemies, walk crouched in tall grass or cover yourself with mud to improve the camouflage value and sneak into the vines, thus obtaining a ~vertical~ hiding place from which to emerge if necessary to pierce a guard with the ever-present pickaxe or knife. There is obviously no shortage of objects useful for creating diversions, such as bottles, jars and internal combustion engines, to be sabotaged so that someone approaches them in order to check their functioning and ends up in our trap. Speaking of traps, as already mentioned in Shadow of the Tomb Raider there is an ability that allows you to connect explosive baits to corpses and which is very useful when you want to avoid head-on collisions; or another that allows you to create poisonous arrows, which cause hallucinations to hit enemies and lead them to shoot their comrades before dying. Very well implemented techniques which, in concert with the use of herbs that improve Lara's performance (beyond the curative ones), prove to be fundamental when we play at the highest difficulty levels, resulting instead not very incisive or merely optional when take on the campaign on the intermediate challenge rating, Rite of Passage. This is undoubtedly a balancing issue, since using the default values it is rare to really get into trouble and usually just pulling out your firearms after a sighting is enough to get the better of any enemy. However, from this point of view we have tried to meet the needs of users as much as possible, allowing you to adjust the difficulty not only through four different presets, but also with independent settings for combat, exploration and puzzles. Deciding which choice to make, however, is not simple: the difficult level makes the opponents tougher and decreases Lara's time to kill, greatly increasing the complexity of the firefights, but at the same timenullifies the effects of the survival instinct, especially regarding the identification of resources and interactable objects. From the point of view of artificial intelligence we can speak of two different attitudes towards the enemies: in the stealth action they are deliberately unaware and move alone rather than in a group to allow us to carry out the eliminations, even if they are very sensitive if perhaps we kill a guard who is being watched by a comrade at that moment; when instead we switch to direct combat, they often try to get behind us, throw bombs and lurk, without changing the position as happens in other third-person shooters. In general, if we want to find a lack of gameplay, it could be said that the clashes are less numerous than we expected: by choosing this approach, the developers have missed an opportunity to flesh out a campaign that focuses much more on exploration and puzzles than not about fighting. The duration of Shadow of the Tomb Raider is in fact a little less than that of Rise of the Tomb Raider: our counter marked less than 13 hours at the end of the story, with a completion percentage of 73%. Of course, after the final battle it is possible to return to the maps to find the collectibles and possibly tackle the tombs left behind, or start a new game plus at a higher degree of difficulty. Xbox One goals The objectives of Shadow of the Tomb Raider for Xbox One revolve around the completion of the adventure, as was to be expected. It is therefore possible to unlock achievements by finding all the artifacts, completing the various Challenge Tombs and maximizing weapons. In the game we will meet some llamas and yes, there is an achievement that is obtained by petting at least five of them. The rest of the achievements are obtained by eliminating a certain number of enemies in various ways, grappling with a certain amount of side missions and completing the campaign. Sound and graphics The sound sector of Shadow of the Tomb Raider certainly deserves applause: the music is excellent, ~epic~ at the right point, capable of effectively accompanying the action; and in the same way we liked the effects and the audio environment in general, capable of rendering the different scenarios in which we find ourselves in a plausible way, be it forests, rainforests, small towns and so on. The lion's share is played by the Italian dubbing, with a Benedetta Ponticelli once again in great shape, accompanied by a very valid but perhaps a little small cast: we needed some more ~mature~ voices to be assigned to the elderly characters, who speaking with a juvenile timbre are not very credible. Among the options there is the possibility of activating dynamic dubbing, which leaves most of the dialogues in the original language with subtitles, for a more realistic experience: appreciable, but for a cinematic atmosphere it is better to leave the default option. So let's come to the highlight of Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the graphics: a central element where you want to create a truly spectacular adventure, which knows how to surprise with the quality of its landscapes and the liveliness of the places to explore. From this point of view, Eidos Montreal has done an extraordinary job, especially as regards the cutscenes: as mentioned at the beginning, some sequences are very powerful and will remain with you; which is no small feat these days. However, it is the artistic direction in its entirety that strikes, even during the most peaceful situations, emphasizing the goodness of the level design and the attention to detail. There are moments when the screen is literally flooded with animated elements, with very convincing lights and reflections (they will be even more so on PC when real-time ray tracing is introduced on NVIDIA RTX cards), and likewise the design of tombs (nine in all) appear really well done. When Lara talks to an NPC, a depth effect is used which enhances the goodness of the standard polygonal models (net of sometimes questionable proportions as regards the head / body ratio), different as we know from those used in the cutscenes, and it works really good during the first few hours, even if it gets lost a bit in the long run. In fact, it is in the intermediate phase of the campaign that some glitches and a lack of finishing are found that perhaps would have required a few extra months of development, accompanied on Xbox One S by a continuous stumbling of the frame rate within the more complex settings. Nothing serious enough to affect the gameplay, but the shots are clearly visible and it is possible to mitigate them by resorting to a gimmick that we did not understand at first", "date": "2018-09-10", "grade": "8.8"}
