The time to wake up and realize the offense suffered that our brave hero immediately launched into war against evil beings, determined to take back the stolen goods. And this is practically all there is to know about the history of Trouserheart, a rather meager but already significant background of what we can expect from this game by Dicework Games, or basically two things: a large amount of blows to be thrown right and left and an equally large dose of simple and light-hearted fun. The basic mechanics are the classic hack 'n slash, seen from above and composed of levels that take place in single screens connected to each other, but the fundamental simplicity is enriched by RPG-style elements that bring this title closer to dungeon games crawler, between continuous progression of the character and wild collection of loot at the end of each fight. All illustrated with a particular characterization that recalls the classic elements of fairy-tale fantasy but with a decidedly hilarious and cartoonish cut. King Trouserheart finds himself having to fight around his kingdom in forests, castles, frozen lands, caves and various other environments, clearing the areas screen by screen until the boss fight of each level, which also represent clashes that are often challenging and also quite varied in terms of game solutions. The control system is bare-bones but is intuitive and functional, based on the classic virtual stick and a single key for the sword attack, with a good response to commands also as regards the stick, an event in itself already quite rare. Trouserheart makes a simple game mechanic fun, looking for a pair of pants Heart pants Trouserheart offers an initial choice between a casual mode, which allows you to tackle the levels with rapid progression and a slow increase in the level of difficulty and a hardcore mode, balanced towards a more demanding challenge and generally recommended for all those who intend to get more involved in the game action. Also note the presence of the ~permadeath~ option which further increases the level of difficulty forcing you to start from scratch each time the character dies. Although the game mechanic is very simple, with its single attack mode and the intrinsic repetitiveness of the situations, the general balance and the continuous progression of the character, as well as a certain variety of settings, manage to keep the players glued for a long time in search of the lost pants. Proof of the facts is not a question of doing anything but striking the enemies who crowd the screen with the sword, but as you progress through the levels you realize that the timing and positioning of the character become fundamental elements in order to survive, the points of save positioned between the screens begin to be real shelters, while the boss fights require a certain strategic planning based on their attack patterns. The evolution of the character represents the other aspect that helps to keep the interest high, giving meaning to the progression in the game and the collection of the ~loot~ that comes from the elimination of each enemy. This role-playing mechanic also appears simplified to the bone, but it is enough to push any dungeon crawler enthusiast to continue exploring the levels to the end. Coins can be spent to improve attack, defense or to apply multipliers to coin collection, in an elementary but well-crafted version of RPG-style character evolution.", "date": "2013-10-03", "grade": "8.0"}
