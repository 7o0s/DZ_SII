Lovecraft. This next-gen reissue offers various graphic improvements and also support for unique functions of PlayStation 5, DualSense in the first place. Let's see all the details in our review. The Sinking City | PS5 review The Sinking City: There is no upgrade to the PS5 version Let's start with the bad news. As already announced by the developers, the PS5 version of The Sinking City cannot be obtained via a free upgrade if you already own the PS4 version. The reason is the legal dispute between Frogwares and Nacon, publisher of the PS4 version: the new game is in fact completely separate from the old-gen one and the team is therefore unable to offer the new games for free. Also, of course, the saves from the PS4 version are not compatible with the PlayStation 5 version. Take this tooth out, let's start with the real review of The Sinking City and try to understand what improvements have been made. First of all, the Lovecraftian adventure reaches a native 4K resolution with a frame rate of 60 FPS. The leap forward of the PS5 version compared to the PlayStation 4 version is therefore sensitive. The graphics are cleaner, and the higher, more stable frame rate makes for smoother exploration. The textures of the environments are also improving, as you can see in the two images below (PS5 on the left, PS4 on the right), also thanks to a more effective lighting system. Obviously the transition to PlayStation 5 has allowed Frogwares to improve various details. The aforementioned lighting system is more effective and, combined with a higher quality fog effect, makes the environments more realistic and impactful. The game now also features lens flare effects, which emphasize the most powerful light sources and give a more cinematic edge to scenes. Window panes and water surfaces (both city rivers and simple puddles) now reflect light, although this is a very basic and sometimes a bit intrusive effect. Overall, however, The Sinking City looks better on PS5, while always betraying its nature as an AA game. They are not the only news, in any case. As you can see from the two images below, the PlayStation 5 version of The Sinking City offers a greater density of elements. In fact, you can see that there are tufts of grass and various dirt on PS5, completely absent on PlayStation 4. The two images also allow you to notice that some textures have been changed: in the lower right corner you can in fact see which part of the terrain is different. Similar parts are also displayed in higher resolution. Sadly, the PS5 version of The Sinking City still suffers from some pop-up issues, with large elements (like trees) appearing and disappearing at medium distance. The same happened in the PS4 version. However, loading has improved. We did some tests with the two versions, both running on PS5, and the difference during an in-game fast travel is about ten seconds ahead of PlayStation 5. Precisely, going from the port area to the hotel where the protagonist resides it takes 2 to 3 seconds in the next-gen version, compared to 12-13 seconds in the old-gen version. Initial loading is also faster. Considering that we'll soon be making quick trips every few minutes, this is a time saver that shouldn't be underestimated. PlayStation 5 also has some unique features that are exploited by The Sinking City. The game cards, for example, are used to show the trophy of the plot mission in progress: they indicate both the percentage of completion and the in-game reward that we will receive upon completion. The functions of the DualSense are more interesting. Frogwares has opted for limited but adequate use. For example, the haptic feedback will generate a small vibration when we move by boat: in the case of collisions with floating objects (it happens frequently, since they are everywhere) we will perceive the impact on the hands. The latter is also positioned correctly depending on the point of the boat that is hit. Is this a core function? No. Coming back to PS4 were we weirded out by the lack of it? Yes. Added to this is a vibration effect for falls and for approaching the most important clues. The Sinking City also takes advantage of the adaptive triggers, for example with the camera which makes the R2 more resistant and makes us perceive the ~click~ of the shot on the finger. We then point out one last oddity: the versionThe Sinking City PS5 does not have manual save, only auto save. For a normal gaming experience this is not a problem, but this will probably prevent players from using the reload of a manual save to repeat sections and obtain certain trophies more easily.", "date": "2021-02-27", "grade": "7.0"}
