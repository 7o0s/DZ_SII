Little advertised, it was bought almost sight unseen by fans of Nippon Ichi, the software house that became famous with Disgaea and numerous other high quality RPGs, whose common denominator was a certain taste for vintage, especially expressed by modest but convincing cosmetics. It turned out to be an excellent Japanese role-playing game characterized above all by an adult storyline and a truly varied and fun gameplay. However, it was not particularly successful, also thanks to the abundance of RPGs for the Sony system, and therefore this sequel all in all amazes for the courage with which it was proposed. The question at this point is: was it worth it? A song for Croix The strongly Japanese character design must not betray the expectations of an adult and engaging plot, which in certain situations rivals the most famous RPG stories of recent years, above all for the strong political vein that characterizes at least half of the adventure. As in the case of the prequel, the historical and social background of the world we will explore has a huge impact on the adventure itself, motivating the choices of the characters, even the most questionable ones, and giving life to a truly remarkable fantasy fresco: a lot of care has been placed in the creation of the world of Metafalls, distant from the previously explored Sol Ciel, but plagued by problems that once again revolve around the Reyvateil, partially biological female creatures who, by singing, are able to influence the reality that surrounds them , psychically interfacing with the tower of Ar Tonelico, which practically acts as the pillar of this universe. When a virus begins to drive the Reyvateils crazy, transforming them into cruel murderers, the politicians declare that it is precisely the Reyvateil administrator of Ar Tonelico who is the cause of this tragedy: a real war breaks out which will involve the protagonist of the moment, Croix, and one shabby group of humans and Reyvateil who will join forces to track down the real threat and save the shack and puppets. Singing in Ar Tonelico is not only a narrative device but also a focal element in the gameplay, consequently on the sound side Gust's product could not disappoint and in fact, as in the case of the prequel, Ar Tonelico II also offers a truly masterful soundtrack , well-kept, decidedly varied and epic. A small masterpiece of musical complexity that makes a barely graceful graphic creation decidedly less unpleasant: Ar Tonelico II is pure technical vintage, with its sprites with fluctuating animations and its two-dimensional backgrounds that mimic a sort of image depth through a naive use too convincing of multiple levels and colors. Ar Tonelico II is not at all unpleasant to see, it is indeed a small dive into the past of 32bit for fans of the genre, but in a 2009 in which next-gen consoles and two-dimensional high-resolution graphics are the masters, the game of Gust feels a bit out of place, even if he runs on a simple PlayStation 2. Quality Control, where r u? Unfortunately it deserves a box apart from the fierce criticism that the adaptation of Ar Tonelico II has deserved: it took a year to bring the game to the West, but the work done by the NIS Quality Control is regrettable. The high frequency of jokes and expressions with an erotic background can be bearable even if decidedly inappropriate, but the quality of the English translation is decidedly poor: full of typos, errors and oversights, it stands out at certain moments for some suspicious or completely untranslated. What's worse, when the final stages of the game reveal an unexpected surge in difficulty, a glitch is also introduced that literally freezes the console every time an enemy, however quite common and fortunately circumventable, launches a certain attack. Really awful. When so much meat on the fire is a pleasure to be enjoyed Ar Tonelico II is one of those remarkable cases where the rough graphic realization hides a beating heart of fun and variety. As in the prequel, the player finds himself having to deal with various playful modes and features that are anything but trivial, intelligently implemented in an old-style RPG structure. For example, the Cosmosphere returns, the psychic dimension of the Reyvateils that must be explored to get to know them better, deepen the relationship between them and Croix and unlock new, very powerful battle songs. Unlike the prequel, in Ar Tonelico II it will be necessary to make choices to progress in the Cosmosphere, which however will allow one to be completed but not the others: the player has to choose the Reyvathe most interesting. The infected Reyvateil can be saved and added to a sort of fanclub: a bit like equipment, they will increase the party's statistics and consequently increase the magical power of the Reyvateil. The combat in Ar Tonelico II is in fact only partially similar to the system designed for the prequel, in a word it is simply better. The original design once again divides the fighting party into two teams: one is made up of Croix and another companion and mainly deals with physically attacking enemies and defending a second pair of Reyvateil busy preparing their magic. The attacks of Croix and associates must be synchronized with the two Reyvateil during the attack phase, acting on the directional pad and influencing the effect of the song; in the following defensive phase the player will have to press the keys of the pad to the rhythm of the enemy attack to mitigate or cancel the damage to the Reyvateil based on his own precision. This scan between attack and defense phases and the interactivity that characterizes them adds considerable frenzy to each clash: considering that random fights have a limited frequency per area, Ar Tonelico II's battle-system is definitely fun and enjoyable. We could also talk about the weapon and equipment creation system connected to our romantic relationships with the Reyvateil, the level-up system of the latter linked to the thermal baths and numerous other bizarre features that characterize the game, but we think to have given the idea of how varied the gameplay of this little NIS branded pearl is.", "date": "2009-07-31", "grade": "7.0"}
