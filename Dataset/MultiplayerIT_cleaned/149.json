As with the preparation for any other exam, we can use the ~Training~ mode in order to refine the subjects in which we are most lacking, we will be comforted at the end of the performance by a manga-style teacher ready to dispense phrases of encouragement and scientific curiosities about the gray matter. The factors that will be evaluated are: correctness of the answers, reaction times to the question and sequence of correct answers with authentic combos every five guesses; with a mechanism similar to similar titles, valid results in the aforementioned factors will unlock new subgames increasing the variety of challenges in which to try and for sure you will reduce yourself like me to neglecting work and family taken as you are by the need to gratify your self-esteem with always scores taller. PRO it's a long-lived title it's good for your gray matter AGAINST irritating uploads", "date": "2007-01-28", "grade": "S.V."}
