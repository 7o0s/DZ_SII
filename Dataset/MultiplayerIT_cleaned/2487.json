{"name": "Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/alone-in-the-dark-the-new-nightmare-3.html", "text": "History First of all, it is good to say right away that the story is not linked to the prequels, so much so that even a boy who has never tried the first three chapters of Alone In The Dark can immediately get to the heart of the story. For connoisseurs of the previous episodes, the decisive change of look for Edward Carnby is surprising, decidedly cooler (don't show it to your girls, you never know), here accompanied by the beautiful Aline Cedrac. But let's go in order. History The action takes place on a creepy island (much more than you think, my word!) called Shadow Island; in this gloomy place a friend of Carnby's, the best paranormal investigator around (if I had written ~of the thrill~ you could have thought that the game was a spin-off of Dylan Dog, or am I wrong?). Charles Fiske, this is the poor man's name, was down there for a task assigned to him by his client, a certain Frederick Johnson, the same person who will send our alter ego there at his precise request, obviously to investigate the real causes that led upon Fiske's death. With Carnby, at the specific request of the client, also the beautiful Aline Cedrac, a busty teacher of ancient Indian languages, takes off. A discrete quality full motion video presentation (like the others that will be in the game together with the classic interlude skits in real time) shows us the journey aboard a seaplane of the 2 protagonists, a journey destined to end dramatically; as soon as they arrive in sight of Shadow Island, the seaplane seems subject to a hostile and unknown force which causes the destruction of the vehicle. Luckily, thanks to the parachutes, our duo manages to save themselves even if they split up: Edward arrives in a forest, Aline even on the roof of a mansion that doesn't really bode well (to put it mildly). It is good to say that the island is in the hands of the Morton family and Aline believes that Charles Fiske was killed by a member of that family, Obed Morton. As is customary in this videogame genre, all those that we initially define as truths with knowledge of the facts are destined to give way to reality, however terrible and frightening it may be. I stop here so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovering the beautiful plot, the twists (which will put a strain on heart patients and easily impressionable people) that permeate the title distributed by Infogrames and now close to release. Small warning right away: if you are afraid of the dark it is useless to continue reading this review, if you don't have any or you are curious, go ahead, now we will talk about... Graphics and system requirements The computer required by the programmers that you will need at least to start Alone In The Dark 4 settles on a P2 300, 64 mb of ram, 8 mb accelerated video card and 400 mb of hard disk space; if you don't have a pc like this (or better yet, superior), even the Psone version is still more than recommended, we know that many of you readers also have a console. A mid-range P3/Athlon equipped with a video card with 16 mb onboard and 128 mb of ram should be enough. With my P3 933, equipped with 256 mb of ram and GeForce 2 GTS used to carry out this test, the game always ran at 60 fps, except for some drops in fluidity here and there which, although it greatly annoys all those who have a super pc just to play (especially after seeing a load of fatigue-free graphics by the name of Gran Turismo 3 eons times this on Ps2), doesn't spoil the fun of this game; let's go step by step anyway: the backdrops are rendered, a detail not exactly admissible nowadays given the power of current PCs but if it can make as many people as possible play Alone In The dark 4, that's fine with me: some backgrounds, such as the interiors or the paintings are really made with knowledge of the facts but the realization of the sky is something abominable. Graphics and system requirements Arriving at the polygonal elements, characters and monsters, the situation continues to make one turn up one's nose: the human characters don't have a large number of animations, not to mention the facial animations, which are completely absent here (how ~nice~ to see Carnby still communicating with Aline over the radio with her mouth closed). If there are no facial animations, let alone if the clothes deform according to our movements, producing folds and rearrangements following steps and hops here and there. Most monsters are made with very littleor number of polygons, but at least they defend themselves better than the characters who almost overpower the belief that this computer version (programmed by Spiral House), removing high resolution and 3D acceleration for the polygonal elements (series elements on computer) is almost indistinguishable from the Psone version, hardware released for the first time in December 1994, if you know what I mean Naturally there is something good: the light effect created by your torch is very well done, fortunately one might say, given that there are definitely many parts in the dark and, as a small pre-announcement, the flashlight will be much more useful than you might think at first. The creation of some monsters generates a certain smile on our face, either for a very ~Lovecraftian~ design, or for some very good achievements, but for the rest much more could and should have been done. Particular mention also for the architectural style chosen for the house, decidedly Gothic which at times recalls the film by the visionary Tim ~Beetlejuice~ Burton, that Nightmare Before Christmas which in the opinion of the writer should have received a better reception. Fortunately, a game like this doesn't need just beautiful graphics to attract (see Silent Hill on Playstation), other are the key elements such as the story and the atmosphere. About the latter one cannot fail to mention.. Scary sound.... Oh yes, a good 50% of the atmosphere of a horror surival depends on the audio sector included in the video game package: electrifying, anguished, drawn or barely audible music is practically mandatory and this fourth chapter of the horror saga Infogrames absolutely does not disappoint in this respect. Really wanting to nitpick..well, the quality of some sounds is not the best (but otherwise they inspire an indescribable shiver down my spine) and the lack of implementation of the EAX sound system (like most of the titles in commerce) makes itself heard: think how many extra jumps towards the ceiling we would have made if there had been the sound localization of every single step, shot, grunt that it is ... in any case we cannot complain, the bad, harsh, scary atmosphere it's there and it's palpable from start to finish, both with Edward and Aline. The version used by the undersigned for this review is fully dubbed and subtitled in English, very well indeed. When in a few days you will find the game programmed by Darkworks and Spiral House on the market, you will find speech and text entirely in our spaghetti-loving language and having played the Playstation version from a friend who gave me the pleasure of testing it thoroughly, I can tell you how it is the translation work has been carried out; as usual the Italian voices are less incisive than those in the Albion language but certainly all those who are not at ease with English (come on, I really hope not in the year of grace 2001!), will not be able to unless you appreciate the work of adaptation and translation. AAAARRRGH, A MONSTER!! Have you ever played a video game like this? Do you know at least Resident Evil and Silent Hill? Here, mix the strengths of these two great video game sagas and you will have obtained the fourth episode of the Carnby saga. Entitled CAPtive COMmunication, Infogrames has drawn on the graphic style (already borrowed from the Osaka software house from the previous AITDs, funny, isn't it?^_^), most of the furnishings and puzzles. The weapon aiming system is also not dissimilar to the first (noteworthy) horror game that appeared on the gray 32-bit Sony, while the inventory is unlimited, generating enthusiasm for this choice (for example to yours truly) who he will avoid long walks far and wide just to deposit weapons and objects in trunks mysteriously confluent with each other, however making others turn up their noses (I think a minority anyway). The saving system is only partially taken up: it is true, without amulets (which take the place of ink) you will not be able to save, but once you have obtained these objects you will be able to save wherever you like, without looking for a typewriter. From the title Konami (which will soon have a sequel on Sony's 128-bit black monolith) that haunting atmosphere is borrowed where even the slightest suspicious sound can give you goosebumps: shortly after starting the game with Aline Cedrac, you will hear a ghostly meow of a cat almost as if something were eating it or, again, in certain areas the monsters will turn off the light forcing you tongendovi to use your faithful torch, really essential to finish the game, also because there are not a few enemies to fear the light (as opposed to others who will draw strength from it!!). In summary, the fights, therefore, are there and they are not even few (Resident Evil legacy), but much is also left to the player's imagination, permeated by terrifying sound effects and screams and a truly spooky darkness (Silent Hill docet). The story is decidedly exciting, twists abound and the atmosphere is ensured not only by the audio side, but also by a whole series of small objects aimed at increasing tension such as letters, photos and lots of tape recorders with messages engraved on tape. Horror vets won't take long to finish the game with both characters, though the longevity is definitely a cut above the games mentioned above throughout this review, mostly by virtue of a number of puzzles that go beyond from the classics ~find the key, open the door and continue~. A word of advice: use a good joypad to play Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare, since using the torch with the keyboard is damn difficult and in any case we see that the game, given its multiplatform nature, was designed with a gamepad ( better Sidewinder) in mind. Turn on the lighteeeeee, please On balance we are faced with a video game recommended to practically everyone, by virtue of a captivating story, a thrilling atmosphere that generates that damned conviction that in less than 5 seconds something will make its way towards us! Indeed, played in the dark and with an adequate sound system, it is really difficult to be able to play for a long time in a row, something that did not happen from the 3 games of the Blair witch saga tested in the past, coincidentally, just by yours truly. A video game that is not perfect, it is true, but at least it has what it takes in terms of the fundamental parameters of a horror video game: engaging story, scary audio, monsters here and there, skyrocketing tension and so on. Recommended for practically everyone, except for children and the faint of heart. A really long wait was that of this video game but it more than worthily repaid our patience. What more to say? Save your pennies that the last week of June, the sure release date for Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare, is near.. The horror returns!! It was the year 1996 when Bio Hazard (in the West known as Resident Evil) was released on the Sony Playstation, erroneously considered by many to be the first horror game (or rather survival horror game) to appear on store shelves. It is not so. At the height of the 90s, Infogrames invents the genre with Alone In The Dark, a great example of storyboards, puzzles and how virtual cameras are managed to really give the impression of watching a horror film. Anyone who remembers this game can't help but notice all the elements in common with the game created by the genius Shinji Mikami, the man to whom we owe other globally known franchises such as Dino Crisis and the upcoming Onimusha (already released by a abroad) and Devil May Cry (the Japanese release of this killer application for Playstation2 is scheduled for the end of August). The setting of the visual sector is borrowed from the title Infogrames, a skilful mix of polygonal elements (such as the characters) and rendered backdrops (therefore two-dimensional), some types of puzzles and the presence of non-player characters scattered, coincidentally, in the mansion, background chosen for the game. Over time both franchises spawned 2 sequels (if I remember correctly the sequel to Alone In The dark was also converted to Playstation and Saturn) but inexplicably the saga ended up on the back burner. Fortunately, it is no longer like this: the return of the investigator Edward Carnby, unfortunately postponed several times, has been long awaited by a large group of fans in the various announced versions, starting from the one that interests us most, for PC, passing for the 2 128-bit consoles available on the market (Dreamcast and Playstation2) and even reaching the best-selling Game Boy Color.", "date": "2001-06-12", "grade": null}
