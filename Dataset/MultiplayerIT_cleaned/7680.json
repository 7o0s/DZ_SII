Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Xbox 360 and PC owners have a precise point of reference when it comes to stunt action games based on trial bikes. We're obviously talking about Trials HD and its sequel, Trials Evolution, but it would be a mistake not to mention the two excellent episodes of Joe Danger. Well, even on mobile devices, both iOS and Android, this genre is very popular and has produced several high quality games over the years. Among all, the Trials Xtreme series seems to stand out, perhaps because it is the one that visually comes closest to what is available on consoles and personal computers. It therefore seemed only right to dedicate an episode of ~The free game of the week~ to the last chapter of this franchise, Trial Xtreme 3, which has recently reached version 1.3 and is therefore decidedly optimized compared to its debut, which took place a few months ago. Moreover, it seems that at the beginning this title was freemium only in words, in the sense that it required the purchase of a package to unlock all levels, otherwise access to only a part of the experience. The in-app purchase to unlock the stages has remained, to be honest, but only as a tool for the laziest users, given that with a little effort and patience, without even jumping through hoops (actually, oh well, doing them, at least in the game) it is possible to dissect the five scenarios present (Norway, Sport, Beach, Port and Valley) and try to obtain the three stars and the cup in each of the tracks, obtainable by collecting all the objects along the way and trying to cross the finish line without ever crashing. Furthermore, if you wish, you can load the ghost of one of the top players and challenge him on the track to get a better time than his. Trial Xtreme 3 is a solid contribution to the genre of trials bike action games Delicacy above all As fans of acrobatic-based sports action games well know, one of the key elements is precision. In fact, it is necessary to balance the weight on the trial bike with great accuracy, loading it on the rear or front wheel depending on the case, so as to optimize jumps and tackle obstacles in the best possible way. From this point of view, the developers of Trial Xtreme 3 have done an excellent job, also in terms of physics, with a final result that is perhaps a little risky in some situations but generally convincing and effective. The default controls provide weight management via an accelerometer, while with three virtual buttons we act on the accelerator, brake and shock absorbers. Unfortunately, this is a configuration that soon shows its limits, and which fortunately we can replace with a fully touch variant, equipped with two traditional arrow keys for managing the load on the bike. Getting excellent performance this way is quite simple, and with quick taps and on-the-fly adjustments you can do everything from trampoline jumps to loop-the-loops, passing over blocks, bricks and even concrete reservations. The imperative, of course, is always the same: don't crash into the driver, under penalty of game over and the possibility of continuing from the last checkpoint, but with a couple of seconds penalty on the final time. This system, solid and convincing, is supported by a well-made technical sector, strong in a fluid frame rate, convincing polygonal models (even during collisions, an often very chaotic moment) and good scenario design.", "date": "2013-08-10", "grade": "7.5"}
