The original football game developed by New Star Games offers a mix of management mechanics, in-game action and retro graphics that pay homage to the great classics of the 90s. Available only on iOS at the moment but also coming to Android, the title comes with an effective free-to-start model, i.e. it allows you to play ten games before deciding whether it is appropriate to invest some change to unlock the full version of the experience, which however costs only  1.09 and in no case includes microtransactions or advertising. Structure Retro Goal, even the tactics are immediate and essential. As mentioned, the one offered by Retro Goal is a mix of different mechanics, therefore we are not talking about a real managerial one but a product that takes the best of the various genres to compose a system that immediately reveals itself captivating. Having selected the team we prefer from the league, we will start from the second series as usual to attempt an ambitious climb that takes us to the top. The game does not get lost in chatter or try in any way to introduce too many elements and facets, rather it remains focused on few aspects while managing, in the end, to cover all the situations that gravitate around the reality of a football club: the management of the structures, the signing of new players, the care of morale and training, and so on . Gameplay Retro Goal, an action that starts from midfield. How does this approach translate once you take the field? It's simple: matches turn out to be a mix of strategic decisions and in-game action, with the latter only materializing when you come across a situation that could change the course of the match. At that point we are allowed to control the players during that specific action, to score or avoid conceding a goal. The touch control system focuses on gestures and is somewhat reminiscent of eFootball PES 2021 Mobile, while playing a lot with ~slingshot~-style solutions to make passes and shots, the latter possible even with a simple double tap when our player receives the ball on the fly and can try to finalize the maneuver. The simple movements are less intuitive, which take place by drawing lines but in a somewhat cumbersome way. Technical realization If the gameplay of Retro Goal characterizes the experience in an important way, so does the technical realization of the game, which as mentioned pays homage to the great classics of the 90s in a successful mix of pixel art graphics and chiptune-style music: a lethal combination for nostalgics, who will immediately feel at home. good job, managing to recreate the typical atmosphere of football of the past.", "date": "2021-07-10", "grade": "7.5"}
