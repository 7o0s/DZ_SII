{"name": "Marginalia Hero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/marginalia-hero-recensione.html", "text": "Marginalia Hero borrows from one of the most infamous protagonists of the Manessian code, specifically Reinmar von Brennenberg, who in a famous illustration in the volume is stabbed in the chest and head while maintaining the expression of one who frankly doesn't care. The character is placed at the center of a very simple casual game, based solely on quick reflexes, which in the context of a campaign made up of a hundred increasingly complex challenges encourages us to touch the screen at the right moment, i.e. when the sword-shaped icon passes over the target-shaped one, thus determining a hit against our opponent. The show offered to us reproduces the medieval pictorial technique of the ancient German songbook in a rather faithful way, and sees the protagonist of the adventure face increasingly larger and more dangerous enemies, starting from apparently harmless rabbits to get to hawks, bulls and disturbing combinations in armour. The hit points of the creatures that we will have to eliminate increase hand in hand with the number of the mission in which we find ourselves, which means that the duels become progressively not only more difficult but also more lasting: we will be able to keep our nerve long enough to carry them completed successfully? Gameplay and structure The gameplay of Marginalia Hero is quite simple, as mentioned: while in the lower part of the screen, displayed in portrait mode, the hero and the enemy on duty find their place, in the upper part we see the number of hit points of the opponent placed at the inside of a circle. A sword-shaped icon moves around its circumference, proceeding clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the case, and our task is to touch the screen when the indicator passes over a target-shaped icon. At first, these are fixed icons and hitting them therefore proves to be a trivial operation, but as the campaign progresses, numerous variables are introduced: the targets move, disappear, follow seemingly unpredictable patterns, are placed at a short distance and the rhythm of the shots gradually increases . In short, to overcome some challenges it is necessary to make some attempts and accept that after a few game overs the game will monetize by showing us an advertising trailer. These are not very invasive elements, indeed the authors have frankly gone light on them, but if you want you can eliminate them by purchasing a 2.29 euro package. Those who then wish to invest an additional sum of money can opt for the 7.99 euro package, which not only eliminates the advertising films but unlocks the ~continue~ and the option to double the loot at the end of a fight. To make the experience a little more interesting there are a rich system of achievements and many unlockable items to be purchased with the in-game currency: different weapons, shields and even companions who can support us in battle. It is a pity that this is not enough to deepen the mechanics of Marginalia Hero, which tend to tire after a short time: we are talking about one of those games that you take out to play a game every now and then, and do not produce addiction. From a technical point of view, however, an excellent job has been done, the atmospheres are original and well accompanied by a perfectly spot-on musical theme: a pity only for the very essential animations.", "date": "2019-04-10", "grade": "7.0"}
