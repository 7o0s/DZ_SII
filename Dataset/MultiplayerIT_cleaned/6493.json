He flies over the foothills of the Himalayas, his helicopter crashes and he ends up in a valley inhabited by crazed Yeti worshippers, alone and without a weapon. In short, a nice way to enjoy a well-deserved rest after the expulsion of Pagan Min. This is the incipit of the latest Far Cry 4 DLC, The Valley of the Yetis, present in the Season Pass but also purchasable individually at a cost of 14.99 EUR. The structure behind this long and substantial expansion is undoubtedly interesting. The first thing we have to do when leaving the accident area is to look for the pilot. The first bars are pure stealth in a Far Cry sauce. The machete, bow, arrows and throwing knives are our only weapons as we explore caves crammed with painted-faced freaks, but the best part comes when we go out to see the stars again, and our only salvation lies in capturing a base with radio tower to call for help. Once taken, it becomes our refuge, and in fact the DLC begins here in all respects. The Valley of the Yetis is a nice expansion for Far Cry 4: here's our review Xbox One goals The Valley of the Yetis comes with a handful of achievements, seven to be exact. Nothing particularly difficult like fortifying the base, killing five Yetis, surviving the first night or completing the DLC. Day and night Alongside the six missions that carry on the main storyline, the other strong point of this expansion are the waves of enemies that attack us every night, gradually made up of increasingly tough and numerous enemies, who attack us simultaneously from all directions. A big problem, especially when enemies equipped with Molotov cocktails arrive from the south, the tanks to the north and the Yetis to the east, while in the meantime others try to place explosive charges to show us the inscription ~mission failed~. How to fend off attacks? Instead of the ~classic~ secondary missions, the game gives us the possibility of doing others thanks to which we can receive barricades, explosive and incendiary traps, minefields and so on as a prize to fortify the entrances to the base. We can also buy them by spending money, but why do that when you can get them for free? It's just a pity that these missions are a bit too similar to each other, especially the ones that involve us stealing a truck and taking it to the base. Fortunately, the other types vary the situation a bit, but a certain basic repetitiveness nonetheless remains. As if that were not enough others then give us the possibility of placing fixed positions in the base. In short, a real tower defense-style horde mode, decidedly challenging night after night, where choosing the right weapon is really important. The biggest problem with these waves doesn't lie in its mechanics but in a design choice that we struggle to understand. The game doesn't really have a day/night cycle, we don't see night fall, there's no urgency to go back to base or find yourself out in the open in the valley between crazed cultists and hungry Yetis. We decide when to ~activate~ the night, and this means that we could ~cheat~, arm ourselves fully, including the base, to make the waves less difficult than expected, neutering the challenge rate. In terms of progression, we start practically from scratch, both in terms of weapons and skills and DIY. Everything contributes to the accumulation of experience but contrary to the main game the need to hunt to enlarge our luggage is less seen that the valley is dotted with dozens of boxes that hide skins. In the same way we will be able to find points where Pagan Min's expeditions have left weapons. Our advice is to travel the length and breadth of the valley, collect everything that is around and in the meantime enjoy a much more fascinating snowy setting than normal Kyrat. The missions of the main campaign are decidedly more interesting, which make us visit caves, glaciers, and temples in the high mountains, with a good pace and well thought out; nothing shocking or really new, but when things get decidedly challenging towards the end, even the most expert adventurers of Kyrat will have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts to survive. But do these Yetis ultimately pose a real threat? It is not enough to line them with lead to kill them, we must first stun them by hitting them on the head and then kill them with the machete in the same way as the ~gunners~ of Shangri-La. On the strait they are in fact a real tank, there is almost no possibility of dodging them when they charge, but if we can see them from a distance we just need to divert them with the throw of a pebble and that's it. Verymore dangerous are the packs of wolves that roam the valleys. Here too, animals are the number one enemy of the game.", "date": "2015-03-14", "grade": null}
