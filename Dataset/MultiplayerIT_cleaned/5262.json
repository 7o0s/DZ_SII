{"name": "The Solus Project", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/174672-the-solus-project-il-pianeta-proibito.html", "text": "The Solus Project talks about the space race, a real race that is not dictated by visions like Musk or by the need to keep a military opponent at bay, but by necessity. In the future imagined by Teotl Studios, it is the destruction of the Earth that forces humanity to explore the cosmic void with five spaceships sent to the ends of the galaxy. One of these, the one on which our digital alter ego travels, reaches a habitable planet, reviving the hopes of an endangered species, but an accident jeopardizes the mission, leaving us alone in a moor surrounded by stormy waters, a place full of secrets and as suggestive as it is dangerous. The Solus Project leaves us alone, abandoned and confused on the surface of a mysterious alien planet The new world With the tumultuous trade show season behind us, it's time to close the accounts with an interesting first-person adventure. Our first encounter with The Solus Project dates back to seven months ago, when only two chapters were available even if the game mechanics were already all available to us. But the full version, which arrived in June for PC and in July for Xbox One, adds a lot of space to explore and finally closes the narrative dimension that has its importance when the fate of humanity is at stake. Unfortunately this fate weighs entirely on our shoulders and gets heavier as we realize that two components and a little patience are not enough to fix everything. The alien planet we ended up on is full of mysteries, questions, painful revelations and dangers that we must face in order to try to understand what has become of our companions and the inhabitants of the planet. To do this, the only possibility we have is to explore and this allows us not only to find traces but also alien artifacts and technologies that give us some breathing room, also allowing us to enjoy the tragic beauty that surrounds us. The polygonal mass is limited and the same goes for the variety of environments, but Gliese-6143-C manages to be darned fascinating amidst torrential rains, snow, meteor storms, all while the waves rage against the coast, the torrid day leaves space to the cold night and the humidity makes its way through our flesh to bite our bones. And here comes the survival dimension that depends on a series of parameters that we can view on a sort of palmtop. Heatstroke, Hypothermia, Humidity, Sleep and Starvation can all be combated by taking advantage of the limited but useful crafting and a whole host of useful items including damp-reducing sponges, alien food, sleeping mats, relics that also increase movement speed, and dropped supplies in the debris of our spaceship. But the planet's threats go far beyond the climate, among shadows that precede us, mysterious creatures that chase us in a delirium of smoke and lightning and disturbing alien dolls that seem motionless but continue to appear behind us. The polygons are not many and the roughnesses abound but the design work and the Unreal Engine give us an environment that is perhaps not particularly varied but suggestive and full of effects which in some cases prove to be original and surprising. Others, however, such as rain, are rather rough but do not compromise the overall performance of a title that gives us breathtaking sunsets and suggestive views. The options also allow us to abuse dell'oversampling, up to 400% of the resolution, and to play with the field of view that can be brought from 45 to 135 degrees. Finally, the title supports HTC Vive and Oculus Rift and also includes the possibility to choose between the international measurement system and the British imperial one. A light at the end of the tunnel The Solus Project combines a structured plot, exploration and survival dynamics, giving us a peculiar experience but which at the same time suffers from some balancing problems. Even by raising the difficulty multiplier, the survival elements become less and less relevant due to too much availability of water, food and tools that allow you to face heat and cold without major problems. Furthermore, several puzzles are all too simple to understand and are at the same time unnecessarily cumbersome while the traps are always easy to overcome as long as you have enough light, which ends up representing the only real pivot of the gameplay in the depths of Gliese-6143-C . Once you have entered a tunnel, what we must remember is that the torches guarantee good visibility but wear out while the crystals illuminate little and alter the temperature, influencing the dynamics of survival. With that in mind, hereWhen there is light, all dangers are reduced and in many cases they can be avoided entirely by exploiting the teleportation which contributes by lowering the degree of general challenge. But the powerful device has another side to the coin, it makes us feel free even in a closed tunnel, it frees us from the rules of the video game, leaving the exploratory dimension in the foreground. Among other things, teleportation also allows you to substantially speed up some movements and it is important to take advantage of this possibility to combat backtracking which unfortunately abounds and can prove tiring. Not everything, therefore, works perfectly and it is a pity given the intelligence with which the survival dimension has been implemented, but what matters is that The Solus Project always manages to recover thanks to surprises and gimmicks that keep the tension high for good part of the fifteen hours which, neglecting most of the secrets and going straight, are used to complete the title. Thanks to the excellent design work, the developers managed to make us feel alone on a distant planet full by skilfully exploiting the traces left by the companions, the alien engravings and the recorded messages that tell us a plot that is often too diluted in the exploration phases but fascinating and not at all trivial. The ending and some obvious contradictions could leave a bitter taste in someone's mouth, but overall the narrative sector gets along great and compensates for the gaps in the gameplay which unfortunately, in addition to the overall balance of the experience, include the movements of the character, woody and unrealistic. And the fluctuating quality includes the interface which is limited and not without problems although it also brings in some notable gimmicks. The protagonist raises the handheld automatically when there is something to examine and to consult the device it is sufficient to look down, in an extremely intuitive way. To interact with objects instead just point the mouse and follow the indicator that appears automatically allowing us to activate, combine or collect with a single click. To save there is no item on the menu but it is sufficient to click on one of the panels scattered in the depths of the planet or sleep being careful not to do it where the rain or high tide risk waking us up and drenching us. Other important indications come to us directly from the glass of the helmet which cracks when it is damaged, gets wet or freezes, warning us of potentially dangerous conditions that are still reported to us, including sleep, even by the artificial intelligence which takes care to remind us until we drop that we are humanity's last hope. In short, there are good ideas here too and, as with all the other elements of the game, they are oriented towards involvement. The soundtrack is also discreet, made up of a few clips that merely underline the dramatic moments, while the ambient sound and the excellent English dubbing fill the gaps very well thanks to quality samplings and disturbing dialogues that guarantee further depth to the atmosphere . And it is precisely this last element that most characterizes The Solus Project, a title recommended above all to those who find the idea of being isolated on a mysterious alien planet intriguing.", "date": "2016-10-04", "grade": "7.5"}
