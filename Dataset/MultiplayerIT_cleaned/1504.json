{"name": "Top Spin", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/top-spin_b.html", "text": "Skills and Stars a go go The skill assignment part is managed excellently, there are four basic characteristics each with five possible levels of specialization, but, through training, it is only possible to distribute 14 ~stars~ among them, so each player will have points of strength and others where it will be more vulnerable. Furthermore, during the progress of our virtual alter ego in the ranking, you will be given the opportunity to assign four particular skills such as ~Ace~ to improve services or ~Speed~, for speed. The combination of skills with the assignment of stars in the basic characteristics will provide the player's true technical background and his performance will be clearly influenced by it. During the Career you will meet increasingly stronger opponents and the CPU AI will become better and better, providing an adequate learning curve for novice players and a good challenge especially in the more advanced levels. As previously mentioned, the Career mode is also connected to the Multiplayer section, in fact in online matches it is possible to use your character with all his skills: the better our tennis player, the greater the chances of defeating other Xbox Live users. in a vicious circle between offline and online which gives this title a very remarkable longevity. Controls at the top! Top Spin undoubtedly has among its strengths the method of controlling the character, as if it were virtually ~divided~ between controls for expert and non-expert players. Through the normal shot, usually set on the ~A~ key, it will be possible to carry out the basic shots, which will vary according to the position with respect to the ball, performing forehands or backhands, at the same time according to the pressure of the key the power developed in the hit. The other three keys provide the drop, cut or lob shots, giving the player a very wide choice of solutions, essential for winning intermediate level tournaments. Finally there are two super shots, the Drop and the Risk Shot, these were introduced especially for expert players and probably to make games against human opponents even more open. Learning how to use them is far from simple, in fact they are carried out by pressing the right and left trigger of the pad before making a hit. By pressing the analog buttons an indicator appears, blocking it in a particular area, you can carry out the two specials. The success or failure of this operation, difficult given the speed at which the cursor moves, will lead to a valid hit or irretrievably to an out. Another note of merit for the game is the rendering of the various types of pitch, the reactions and physics of the ball are in fact influenced by the surface on which you are, increasing rebounds or speed after impact with the ground. For the exhibition mode, various options are selectable to change the level of CPU AI, the number of games and sets required for victory, and of course the possibility of using women or men in single or double matches. The default camera in the game is decidedly close-up, framing the player in the third person, it gives the sensation of being literally right inside the field, the other selectable one has a view of the field from above with a particular angle that allows game management more effective, even if less choreographed. On the screen during the matches there is also an indicator called ~ITZ~, or In the Zone, the more points and good plays you make, the more the level rises, and if this meter becomes completely colored, then you will be able to make them with more chances of success difficult shots like the Risk Shot. The disproportionate amount of gadgets and clothes that can be purchased in shops and the number of selectable professionals deserve another special mention, all rigorously modeled with the likeness of their real counterparts (sixteen for both women and men). There are also numerous various fields available, which include real and famous arenas such as those of Wimbledon, up to private pitches for sponsor tests. Technical corner Technically Top Spin is undoubtedly the reference point for all titles in the category, fixed frame rate at 60 fps, video cleaning without aliasing or flickering defects, stadiums and playing fields very well made, excellent lighting effects, fluid animations and convincing, particle effects such as dust and streaks left on the clay courts and animated 3D audience, all combined with well-crafted polygonal models,with convincing facial expressions. As far as the sound is concerned, we find ourselves with a part, that of the environmental effects, voices and in-game sound effects, well reproduced, while as far as the music is concerned, the work is certainly not up to the game, resulting these uninvolving. Technical corner A few moles... Even Top Spin has some flaws and after literally stripping it, the idea also crossed our minds that these ~negative sides~ were left on purpose, because improving the rest of the game in a possible sequel would have been somewhat difficult. The possibility of using one's soundtracks saved on the Hard Disk is missing and, more importantly, the impossibility of playing games via Xbox Live through four different consoles in doubles matches, given that this type of match can only be played with four players hooked up to two Xboxes and connected online. Another limitation is also the impossibility of carrying out mixed matches between men and women, and the lack of an intermediate camera between the close-up and the one from above. The weaknesses of the game end here, everything else is a continuous satisfaction. Comment Top Spin is without the slightest doubt promoted with full marks, thanks to the successful gameplay, the online multiplayer support which gives it great longevity and obviously a high-level graphics department. The game published by Microsoft certainly boasts the title of ~Best Tennis Game~ for this generation of consoles, but we feel we can say that even the glorious Virtua Tennis has finally found a roommate at the top of the category; add full XSN and Xbox Live support to all of this, and we have one of the best titles ever in the Xbox line up. Pros: Xbox Live & XSN support Graphically excellent Gameplay flawless Cons: No to custom Soundtracks Double via Live only between 2 Xboxes Microsoft makes its debut in the world of Sampras and his companions and does it from the front door, churning out one of the best sports titles of this generation. When Microsoft's XSN sports line had not yet been revealed, there was the announcement of Top Spin, the first photos, the first judgments on the graphics, the first doubts about the choice of Power and Magic Developement as the developer of this internal project and then, finally, the first impressions after the tests carried out at E3 2003. Since then a long time has passed and I assure you that the programmers have not been idle, there have been improvements in all aspects of the game, probably following the impressions of the various journalists and beta testers, eager for a successor to Sega's stainless Virtua Tennis. Top Spin has the rights to use the image of many champions, such as Lleyton Hewitt, Sampras, Michael Chang, James Blake, Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova, both as opponents in the various tournaments and as playable characters. The main menu of the game allows various choices, the classic ~Tennis School~, where it will be possible to familiarize yourself with the controls, the offline modes such as the Single Match, a Customizable Tournament, the Career mode and obviously the online multiplayer options. Precisely these last two are the pillars of Top Spin and are invariably linked to each other. Career mode allows you to create your own tennis player and shape him (both physically and in skills) at will, immediately after choosing the gender of our character, it will be possible to assign him various somatic characteristics and I assure you that the combination possibilities are many: not only it is possible to modify every part of the face, the hairstyle or the body, but you can also choose the starting accessories, such as bandanas, clothes and rackets. Once the character has been created, you start playing and it is possible to join a Sponsor (also strictly real) who will bring you additional funds, through small private tests for advertising purposes, but you can also remain independent and immediately go to the first tournament. obviously starting from the bottom of the World Ranking. The purpose of the Career is simple: to win tournaments to climb the rankings and earn money, in fact this will be used to pay the various masters scattered around the world, which will allow you to improve the character's skills or to buy all the coolest accessories in the shops and further customize your player.", "date": "2003-11-05", "grade": null}
