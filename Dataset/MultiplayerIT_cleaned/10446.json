Does Dreamkiller look like a Painkiller clone to you? We're not kidding, Dreamkiller is a shameless clone of Painkiller, made pretty well by the way, rowanbol. Developed by the same team that brought you Painkiller: Overdose, put you in the skimpy, wrinkled shoes of Alice Drake, a psychotherapist who treats patients entering their dreams and breaking down their phobias with shotgun shots (the times of the couch and dream interpretation are over). Our girl, who evidently graduated with Chuck Norris, has a not bad temper (and also the need to put patients at ease goes down the drain) and is not very prone to dialogue. It's true, every now and then he tries to say some nonsense to interpret what he sees in the mind of the customer on duty, but he always ends up blowing everything up, so why waste time? Things get serious As already mentioned, we are practically facing a Painkiller starring a woman. So expect shooting, furious shooting and heart-pounding shooting interspersed with obsessive shooting and vicious shooting. All levels are structured like arenas and the very short exploratory phases are used only to move from one area to another where to restart the symphony of weapons. Our girl, who evidently graduated with Chuck Norris, has quite the temper The enemies always attack in large numbers and have an artificial intelligence that ranges from the tissue to the participant in the Big Brother selections, with peaks that can reach the level of a guest of Men and Women. Obviously, as Serius Sam teaches, this is not the case in which we will regret studied attack tactics or refined encirclement maneuvers. What counts are the numbers and the clashes leave no time to think. The important thing is to shoot and dodge as many shots as possible, perhaps avoiding ending up in some cliff (they will be dreams, but they hurt a lot). From the point of view of the framerate, Dreamkiller proved to be constant and on the test configuration it never dropped below 60 frames per second A supposition is not enough The twelve levels that make up the game are very varied. The developers have taken the liberty of creating diverse scenarios and enemies, using the idea of different mental afflictions as a creative springboard. Is the patient afraid of toys and is he agoraphobic? Get ready to face killer dolls in very large spaces. Is the paranoid on duty afraid of spiders? Guess who will be the enemies of the level? Need a hairdresser? Fear of madness? Welcome to the asylum. Feasible examples would be many others, but we understand each other. From this point of view, the lack of stylistic unity may annoy some, but others will find it interesting and enjoyable to wander through levels that change radically even internally, following the pathology of the patient on duty. At the end of each level is the inevitable boss, usually a bigger than average enemy, while each enemy killed can drop talismans that recharge energy, magic or enhance weapons - of the latter you can bring two at a time and each has two fire modes. Technically we are average, although we certainly cannot cry out for a miracle, also due to a production that is not exactly a triple A title. However, the developers have been able to use the resources at their disposal wisely and where the money has not arrived, they have made up for it with the imagination and the ability to create interesting levels and crazy enemies, representing well the deviant dream worlds of the patients.", "date": "2009-10-23", "grade": "7.0"}
