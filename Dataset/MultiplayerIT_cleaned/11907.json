{"name": "Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/heroes.html", "text": "Broadcast for a few weeks also in Italy, Heroes is one of the most successful television series in the USA, where the second season has just begun. The story is about some people who suddenly discover that they possess superhuman powers. One of these, a weird Japanese boy named Hiro, has the ability to travel in space and time: it is he himself, from the future, who warns everyone of a catastrophe that will hit New York shortly thereafter. And so the various protagonists of the show, consciously or not, will move in such a way as to avert the threat. Gameloft has always shown great attention to this type of licenses, and so here comes a mobile tie-in that anticipates a possible console version. In its mobile reduction, Heroes sees us control some of the protagonists of the show in stages that reflect their deeds. As happens in numerous tie-ins, therefore, we will have to try our hand at different game mechanics depending on the occasion: the levels in which we play the role of the beautiful Niki Sanders are old-fashioned scrolling fighting games, those in which we control Hiro Nakamura are a sort of puzzle game with action elements, those with Peter Petrelli are divided between platform sessions and others in which you have to fly while avoiding obstacles. This particular setting is necessary when in the game you have to deal with different themes and try to stay as close as possible to the plot. It is clear that the result shows ups and downs, in this case the fighting game sections are those with the greatest depth between combos, weapons and objects that can be used against opponents. Niki's power is the most controversial one: apparently, her super strength is activated only when a deviant personality takes over. In the game, this situation is best represented especially when using the ~smart bomb~, an attack that can be activated when the blue bar is full: the mysterious symbol that Niki has on her shoulder appears on the screen when she changes personality, and between one flash and the other we see the girl massacre all the enemies that surround her. The management of vital and ~spiritual~ energy is identical for all characters: by defeating opponents and breaking the elements of the scenario, red or blue spheres are released, which respectively replenish the health bar and the of power. The graphics of Heroes is very well done: numerous digitized images of the characters of the show season the dialogues, while the sprites boast a good quality of the animations and the scenarios manage to be quite rich and detailed. The use of colors is excellent, and helps to make the result very similar to what was obtained with 16-bit consoles. As for the sound, we have a musical theme that follows the television one and good quality sampled effects. We are always on the essentials, however, so nothing above the average of mobile games. The control system is extremely simple and immediate, it is mainly based on the use of the joystick and on the FIRE button (or 5) and on the 0 button. It is clear that the experience becomes more fun if you have a soft joystick. PRO Very faithful to the TV series Technically excellent Some very well done sections... AGAINST ...as opposed to other less successful ones Contains previews of the first season Sometimes cumbersome", "date": "2007-10-23", "grade": "S.V."}
