{"name": "Very Very Valet", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/very-very-valet-recensione.html", "text": "The Very Very Valet review talks about a game that could alternatively represent the realization of a dream or a nightmare, in the opposite cases in which you have had to deal with valet parking as a valet or as a customer. The practice in question, to tell the truth not very widespread in our area, provides that the customers of a club entrust the car to expert personnel in the parking lot, who drives the car, parks it and then returns it (possibly intact) to the customer exit. This situation implies a tacit moment of delicate emotional exchange between two people, with one entrusting the other with a precious asset such as their car. The thing is passed off with extreme nonchalance but it is clear that behind it there is a load of fears, responsibilities and a sense of human trust in others that make this handover of the car keys something more complex and profound than a simple and peaceful habit consolidated. Well, Very Very Valet upsets conventions by leveraging precisely the most ferocious and primordial instincts of the valet, giving free rein to his dreams of destruction and consequently to the most hidden nightmares of the customers, who, however, do not seem to take it all that badly, in the strange world staged by Toyful in this bizarre game. Very Very Valet enacts the reckless life of valet parking On the other hand, it's not like we're really dealing with a realistic context: our boss is a kind of exalted pigeon and a bit too convinced of his role, while the protagonists are creatures that seem to come straight from the world of Muppets, for starters. However, the basic mechanics are based on the real principle of parking, in the sense of having to take the car, find a place for it and then return it within a time limit. Instead, everything else, starting with how to manage and drive the cars once you get the keys, is completely out of your mind. The art of extreme parking The dynamics are precisely what one might expect from a parking simulation: each level has a different structure in terms of roads, traffic and various obstacles, but all (apart from the bonus stages with different challenges) involve the presence of a into which various customers flow in and from which they then leave at different time intervals. Our aim is to take care of the cars, find them a parking space where to leave them for a few minutes (or seconds) and then bring them back to their respective customers in the delivery area, all within the time limits set for both picking up and returning the cars. This may seem simple but it is not at all: first of all because the time allowed to carry out the operations is extremely limited, then due to the absurd influx of customers, which requires you to operate at maximum speed and finally due to the very structure of the levels , which obviously do not have normal roads and parking lots in which to maneuver with ease, but range from intricate traffic junctions to absurd solutions complete with dimensional passages, teleporters, ramps, jumps and catapults. on a deranged interpretation of physics, which have been so fashionable for some years now, especially among the younger ones, but comparisons with Totally Reliable Delivery Service, Human Fall Flat and the like stop above all at the facetious aspect and chaos that may generate from gameplay, as the situation is a bit different here. Very Very Valet has a pretty crazy cast of characters First of all, the driving model is obviously not realistic but it is far from being ~broken~: indeed, it is a purely arcade game, but the cars respond well and in a rather immediate way, although it also varies according to the nature of the vehicle we are dealing with. The control system structured in a contextual manner with respect to the player's view also seems to simplify the action, therefore the challenge is not distorted by an artificial complication of simple things, but derives precisely from the chaos provided by the various variables in the field and partly also by lack of organization of the player himself. Driving skills and the ability to organize spaces therefore play an important role in the gameplay, even if the absurdities of level design end up being the masters in most cases, complicating everything amid big laughs. Absurd levels Very Very Valet also features extra levels with different tasks to perform, again based on driving As employees of the award-winning company Very Very Valet, we are called upon to carry out our duties in different situations that make up the levels of the game: based on whichnumber of cars reported to customers, our score can range from zero to three stars, with the total number of these determining the unlocking of the following worlds. What is particularly hilarious is that customers find practically nothing to complain about even if a wreck is returned to them instead of the car, but it is imperative not to waste too much time picking up and returning vehicles, because otherwise customers will get angry and the cars literally fly away (with a lot of amazement on the part of the parking service manager himself). By making too many customers ~run away~, our score drops significantly, precluding progression to the next levels, so the challenge is played above all on timing, which is influenced by a large number of variables: the layout of the roads, the need to cross obstacles (both on foot to reach customers and by car to park and return them) complete with mechanical activation of timed passages, the presence of external traffic and, above all, the chaos that we can generate by arranging parked cars without the right care determine the major elements of difficulty in the structure of the game. The mechanism finds some variations in the bonus levels, where the aim can change significantly, while still relying on reckless driving and the time limits to follow. It is a game that obviously offers the ultimate in cooperative multiplayer, clearly present in an offline form for up to four players, and this is the way Very Very Valet must be enjoyed, otherwise it will drastically reduce the fun. It could actually be the main limitation of the title, but it is an identifying feature of party games in general, so it must be assumed that such a game is largely to be avoided if played in single player. If anything, we would have appreciated the possibility of online multiplayer instead of relying exclusively on that in the presence, which can represent a significant limit to use. Some levels of Very Very Valet are particularly intricate and crazy From a technical point of view, Very Very Valet is very simple, but aesthetically clean and appreciable, with a good balance in terms of physics management and an ~imaginative~ driving model. The level design alternates very well thought out maps with others that are too chaotic: it is true that this feature should benefit the laughing fun that emerges from the enormous mess that is generated on the screen, but in some cases the random elements seem too many and can unbalance the game mechanism.", "date": "2021-05-25", "grade": "7.2"}
