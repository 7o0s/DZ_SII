At first glance, AdVenture Capitalist appears as a perfect mockery of modern society, based for many mere mortals on the dream of being able to raise money to no end, a destiny reserved for few. A perspective sometimes similar to that of the dog chasing its tail, with no way to spend its wealth except by putting others aside, entering a circle from which it is very difficult to get out. After having played AdVenture Capitalist to write this review, we believe that Hyper Hippo Games really wanted to make fun of the western world a little with its title, even if in terms of game mechanics it was born simply as yet another pastime, among many browser games available in the Kongregate cauldron, in which it has been one of the most played in recent months. Precisely this success has led AdVenture Capitalist to go beyond the boundaries of browser games, first arriving on mobile in Android and iOS versions and then on desktop through Steam, where it has been available for some time completely free of charge. If starting from a lemonade stand to build your gazillion empire doesn't scare you, but especially if you're ready to click like obsessed on the left button of your mouse, follow us in this review. AdVenture Capitalist makes us all click-click-click-click-millionaire! Thumbs twirl On its page on the Steam store, AdVenture Capitalist is officially painted as a ~capitalism simulator~, but the best description is ~simulator of immoderate earnings by doing little or nothing~: the dynamics of the Hyper Hippo game in fact provide for a simplification to the bone , within which all you have to do is click repeatedly on the few buttons available, basing the growth experience on an incremental model that is now more than tested. Just to mention one of the most famous exponents of what over time has incredibly become a real videogame genre, it is a sort of Cookie Clicker, with the difference that in this case, cookies are not accumulated but money. As anticipated, at the start we find ourselves with only one lemonade kiosk: by clicking on the relative icon, it is possible to start making it profitable, generating after a certain period of time an economic return in one's coffers, calculated on the basis of the number of establishments of the same type owned, or if you prefer clicks on the ~Buy~ button. Once a chain of identical businesses is set in motion, it becomes possible to invest the money in a different sphere, thus starting a cycle that goes to infinity and beyond - where even Rockefeller has never gone - to accumulate large amounts of money capable of teaching us the difference between a sextillion and a decillion, leveraging its appeal on the disproportionate size of the sums of money at stake. With disarming simplicity, we go from lemonades to selling newspapers, trading donuts and so on, up to bigger things like buying a film studio or an oil rig, and then even landing on the moon with new businesses to start, carrying out those actions that remain the same from the beginning. In AdVenture Capitalist there is practically nothing to manage: the very little that there would be consists in starting the various timers by clicking on the icon that starts the collection of money, but in reality it is soon taken away from us by the figure of the manager, that we can hire to perform this action for us. So we get to the point where we just have to look: when we get tired of collecting endless greenbacks, we will be able to sell everything and start over from scratch, introducing some ~angel investors~ with this sacrifice to reach even higher figures in less time, restarting once again in the same loop as always. The business goes on To ensure that the player collects billions and billions of dollars, AdVenture Capitalist also goes beyond the time spent playing in his company, continuing to calculate the income of our activities with the PC off, or while we are playing another title. From the second time we start the game, in fact, we access a summary screen that tells us how long we have been away, but above all how much our economic empire has been able to collect while we were busy with something else. It is useless to lie: like its other similar click shots, AdVenture Capitalist knows how to capture the player perfectly, driven to remain for hours with the game open to wait to unlock this or that'item, to be clicked on again and again and again. From this point of view, graphics and sound are only optional (you'll soon want to eliminate the repetitive music), while the menus suffer from some navigability problems, also due to bugs that sometimes make their content disappear.", "date": "2015-05-09", "grade": "5.0"}
