Four years later, the title also arrives on other platforms and it is a positive thing, considering the goodness of the game in question and its particularities. Warner Bros. has linked the success of its LEGO video games to partnerships with important names, usually belonging to the cinematographic field, thus proposing ~constructive~ themed interpretations of well-known series and characters in other fields, from Star Wars to Marvel super-heroes and DC Comics. The peculiarity of LEGO City Undercover is instead its being disconnected from this concept, being based precisely on the universe of toys and thus proposing a story and a reference world free from ties to consolidated licenses. This does not mean having lost the typical humorous momentum and parody verve, indeed the opportunity was taken by Traveller's Tale to put together a hodgepodge of quotations, from those explicitly taken from crime films and TV series to those implicitly linked to the parody of the open world action game and criminal setting whose mechanics are here taken up, disassembled and reassembled to apply them to the typical LEGO spirit. In short, it is an important title in the ecosystem of building bricks, because it demonstrates how the game structure has its validity regardless of the various important names with which it is usually associated, from time to time. After four years in exile on Wii U, Chase McCain is back on track across all platforms City of bricks Undercover also fits perfectly into the classic canon of LEGO games, so anyone who has already tried any of the previously released chapters will already have a pretty clear idea of how it works. It is an action adventure that includes action phases and a large number of puzzles of varying scope, focused on mechanics that have to do with constructions and therefore on the destruction and recomposition of scenario elements or on the exploitation of different abilities for characters different (in this case related to different costumes for the same protagonist). The distinctive element, in this case, is provided by the presence of a vast freely explorable world, which exponentially expands the possibilities of exploration and interaction with the scenario and the characters, also allowing the use of a wide variety of vehicles drawn from the tradition LEGO. It is not the only chapter to present such a solution, which is shared by the almost contemporary LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, but while the latter's New York seemed more like a huge scenario capable of spectacularizing and giving more free rein to the powers of super-heroes, in this case LEGO City appears as a denser and more vivid setting, more cohesive and full of secrets, secondary missions and hundreds of collectible items, although in this case too there is no lack of a real level structure that marks the progression in the story, interspersed with raids within this large sandbox made of bricks. On the history and details of the game, we refer to the same review of the Wii U version to which we referred previously, because essentially nothing has changed from that to these new versions, while we take stock of the innovations introduced. Double Chase After four years and a semi-generational changeover, it could have been the occasion for a profound renewal for LEGO City Undercover, which in fact did not happen. The game content is exactly the same as the original, with the addition of a co-op multiplayer mode which was indeed a huge lack on Wii U, being a staple of the entire LEGO series. It is now possible to bring a second character into play at any time, with a simple drop-in/drop-out mechanic, even if the implementation appears extremely simplified: the new character is nothing more than a clone of Chase with offset colors and its location does not find a particular justification in the story and situations of the game. The missions and puzzles are the same as in the original version, therefore there is no structure actually designed for the cooperative multiplayer game, which thus extends the fun to two players in the most basic sense, without specifically designed solutions. Since this is a product aimed at a wider audience, however, it represents a particular additionnt appreciated for the classic family dynamics of parent-child play or between several children. It should be noted that the Switch version, reviewed here, requires two ~complete~ controllers to start multiplayer, i.e. it is not compatible with the use of the two Joy-Cons as a pair of mini-controllers. As a good Wii U exclusive, the original version heavily focused on the use of the GamePad, which in fact still appears in the game as a special device given to Chase, and in the transition to the other consoles the dual screen feature disappeared with a good rearrangement of the interface that made everything more fluid and comfortable, although obviously less particular. In this regard, we note the total lack of use of the Switch's motion sensors: although the game situations have been transposed directly from Wii U and could therefore in some cases take advantage of the accelerometer and gyroscope also on the new Nintendo console, the developers have decided for exclusive use of analog sticks. Streets cleaned up The game has obviously been polished and now appears more in keeping with the standards of PC, PlayStation 4, Switch and Xbox One even if the distance from its original version is not abysmal. The resolution has been raised to 1080p and the enrichment of elements on the screen is visible with a general increase in detail and wider shots that give a more lively and eventful image of LEGO City, but we certainly cannot expect this to represent a sort of benchmark on the most modern hardware. The work done to make a four-year-old game released on a console with lower characteristics current is visible and LEGO City Undercover is perfectly enjoyable in these new versions, but being resold practically at full price, an additional commitment would have been appreciable, perhaps aimed to the solution of a couple of problems that already afflicted the original between fluidity and loading times. There are still various drops in frame-rate clearly visible in the open world sections, which on Switch are more frequent in the portable version, a sign of a difficult adaptation of the original code given that the polygonal mass should not be burdensome for the hardware. Also reduced, but still noticeably present, are the long loads in the transitions from external to internal and vice versa, even if in the vast outdoor sandbox the game flows without interruption. For those who played the original on Wii U there are obviously not enough reasons to consider a new immersion in LEGO City, given that the contents are identical beyond the multiplayer and the technical changes made, which in any case do not distort the aspect and experience of the game released in 2013. The excellent localization in Italian is also confirmed, both in terms of texts and dialogues, a detail to take into consideration given that not all LEGO games have it.", "date": "2017-04-10", "grade": "7.8"}
