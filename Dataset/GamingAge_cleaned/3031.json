{"name": "Milos Quest", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/03/milos-quest-review-for-ps4-ps-vita-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Back in the fall, Ratalaika released lightUPs Super Box Land Demake, a fairly dull puzzle game that came and went without making any kind of impression (unless, of course, you were after an easy Platinum).I mention this to start off a review of Milos Quest for a few reasons. First, because Milos Quest is also from lightUP/Ratalaika, which means you know youre getting a quick and easy Platinum out of it. Secondly, and more importantly, Milos Quest is what wouldve happened if Super Box Land Demake had been fleshed out into something substantially more interesting.See, it has the same foundation as Super Box Land Demake: like last years game, Milos Quest is a retro-influenced puzzle game where you move boxes around to open gates. The difference, however, is that Milos Quest adds in crucial elements like a story and a challenge. Youre not just pushing boxes around for the sake of pushing them around, youre pushing them around to get to Evil King Old Skull and his minions, who are wreaking havoc across this games very small lands. Its hardly the most original plot, but compared to a game with no plot, its a major upgrade.Having enemies around also makes a big difference. Super Box Land Demake fell flat because it was just room after room of boxes to move around. In Milos Quest, by contrast, you have to dodge and smash enemies, which gives the whole thing a little more urgency. Not a lot, to be sure, since its a fairly easy game, but still: it makes you feel like youre moving forward.Just because Milos Quest is a big step up, mind you, it doesnt mean that its without its flaws. Some may be put off by the lack of challenge and the short running time, but for me, the biggest issue is that theres no map. Seeing as the game tends to reuse assets, this means youre going to get lost pretty easily, and be forced to backtrack through the same sections with some regularity.That said, because its so short and so easy, its not like youll be spending hours going back and forth. Milos Quest is a pretty solid way to kill an hour (or, likely, less), and if you go in not expecting too much out of it, youll probably enjoy it.", "date": "March 26, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
