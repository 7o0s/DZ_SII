Ive played  and occasionally sorta-tolerated  the odd Senran Kagura game. So in theory, I should be able to enjoy  or at least mostly appreciate  Neptunia x SENRAN KAGURA: Ninja Wars, seeing as its a mash-up of the two, right?Goodness, no. Somehow, Neptunia x SENRAN KAGURA: Ninja Wars brings together a series known for its sense of humour with a series known for shoehorning ginormo-boobs into every situation decent action, and ends up being the dullest game imaginable.The main problem is that even if Ninja Wars has dashes of Neptunias humour, it also features the series biggest drawback: the endless talking. While Ninja Wars may promise (obviously) ninja wars, the reality is that the game features only tiny bits of action here and there, scattered amongst very, very long  and very, very inane  dialogue sequences.How long? Let me put it this way: not counting a brief tutorial, the first time you get to actually interact with the game beyond moving the dialogue forward comes around the one-hour mark. Then you briefly get to fight your way through a fairly easy dungeon, before the game throws you into yet another long dialogue scene. Repeat that a whole bunch, and you have some idea of what there is to expect here.This might be okay if Neptunia x SENRAN KAGURA: Ninja Wars featured dialogue that was actually interesting. But its not. In fact, its pretty much exactly what youd expect from a mash-up of these two series  which means you get a fair amount of self-aware jokes, lots and lots of stupid innuendo, and an absurd amount of useless exposition. Maybe that latter bit will be fascinating to anyone who really cares about Neptunia lore  but I honestly cant imagine how. Ninja Wars takes the series tendency to use twenty sentences where two would do, and expands it to absurd proportions.And again, it does this without offering much in the way of action. Eventually you unlock side quests, but even these are just more grind-y dungeons where you hack away at enemies whose offence mostly consists of bouncing at you aggressively. For a game that promises ninjas, Neptunia x SENRAN KAGURA: Ninja Wars is awfully short on actual opportunities for fighting.I know: thats not why people usually play these games  the presence of Senran Kagura should have been a dead giveaway for that. But even so, as much as I generally loathe those games, I can still acknowledge they feature some decent action  and Neptunia x SENRAN KAGURA: Ninja Wars simply doesnt, by any stretch of the imagination.", "date": "December 28, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
