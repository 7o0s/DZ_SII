{"name": "Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/11/injustice-gods-among-us-ultimate-edition-review-ps4/", "text": "This is another PS4 review where Im essentially going to reference the original review done on site, and just add some PS4 tidbits to it. Chris D. did our original review for Injustice: Gods Among Us back on the Xbox 360 and PS3, which you can find here. I agree with pretty much every thought he had then, and this is still an excellent fighting game on the PS4 that fills that fighter launch gap quite nicely.That said, I dont think its a significant upgrade compared to something like Assassins Creed IV. Sure, theres a notable visual upgrade, but something about the character models feels a little cheap and plastic like with the improved visual fidelity. This really stood out to me in the intro of the game, with the GCPD running around in slow motion responding to the event in Metropolis that kicks off the game. Something in the character models just looks wrong to me, and it put me off of the visuals going forward.But despite not being impressed with the upgraded look of the Injustice, its still a blast to play. The story mode cribs all the right moves from 2011s Mortal Kombat, developed by the same team. Youll weave in and out of different character perspectives with each chapter, giving you access to fan favorites like Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern. The alternate Earth storyline is a unique tale just for the game, but feels right at home within the Multiverse approach that DC Comics is well-known for.Combat is easy enough to pick up and understand for just about everyone, with simplified combos and special moves that dont require ridiculous input strings to master. But knowing when to execute combos, blocks, and counters can still require a solid level of skill, providing enough depth to keep fighting game experts engaged. Online play is solid with little in the way of connection issues, and this edition of the game nets you all the character DLC that was issued post release.", "date": "November 27, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
