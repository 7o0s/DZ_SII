{"name": "Pocket RPG", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/01/pocket-rpg-review-ps-vita/", "text": "As much as I love my Vita, even I have to admit there are a few areas in which the selection is a little less than optimal. Take dungeon crawlers, for instance. Even though a Diablo-like game would be perfect for the handheld, we havent really seen any. There was Dungeon Hunter: Alliance at launch, and (sort of) Silent Hill: Book of Memories not too long after, but since then, its been pretty much nothing. (Dont even get me started on that whole Warriors Lair/Ruin fiasco.)Pocket RPG is, obviously, not Diablo. The story isnt as deep, the options arent as varied, and the graphics are about what youd expect from a game that got its start in the mobile realm. If you go into it looking for a Diablo replacement, in other words, youre going to be pretty disappointed.If, however, you go in simply hoping for a well-made dungeon crawler thats been built for playing on the go, then youll find Pocket RPG more than does the job. The levels are large enough to make you feel like youve accomplished something, but at the same time theyre not so huge that you cant get through them during a medium-length commute. Likewise, while the controls arent particularly complex (its basically one button to swing your weapons, and one to jump and smash down with your weapons), the game still calls on you to take a strategic approach  you could try hacking and slashing your way through levels, but that will just mean near-instant death the moment you reach a boss fight.In fact, if were talking about strategy, its worth noting that Pocket RPG requires players to think strategically not just during individual levels, but also over the course of the game. None of the money or weapons you earn in one level carry over to the next, but your skills do, which means that youre constantly figuring out how to optimize what your character can do, while at the same time hunting for new weapons combos that will create the most damage. While some may find that a little annoying, I think its a neat wrinkle that keeps you on your toes throughout the game.", "date": "January 22, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
