{"name": "The Eyes of Ara", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/06/the-eyes-of-ara-review-for-switch-pc/", "text": "The Eyes of Ara is one of those games that didnt get its start in the mobile gaming world, but it feels like it should have. Its one of those games that feels like its best experienced on a phone, with touch controls, graphics that are nice to look at, and not a whole lot else.By that, of course, I mean that even if The Eyes of Ara talks in its store description about secrets and mysteries and adventure, the reality is theres not a lot of depth here. Its the sort of game where you solve environmental puzzle after environmental puzzle, without much to hold your attention beyond that.To be fair, of course, some of these puzzles are outstanding. In a way, it kind of reminds me of The Witness  only I hated The Witness for its obscure internal logic, and The Eyes of Ara doesnt really have anything like that. Rather, its just lots of puzzles placed in a way that hint at something deeper, but if you look closely youll realize: nope, just lots of puzzles.Mind you, look closely and youll also see a very nice-looking game. The Eyes of Ara consistently dazzles you with its environments, even if they dont go any deeper than what you see on the surface. Its a little too shiny at times, considering were supposed to be talking about a decrepit castle, but Im not going to complain too much about that.And honestly, Im not complaining too much about any of it. I may criticize The Eyes of Ara for lacking depth, but if you just want a puzzle game, itll deliver just that. Sometimes you dont want to bog quality puzzles down with excessive plot  and in those times, The Eyes of Ara is just about perfect.", "date": "June 22, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
