{"name": "Cross the Moon", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/08/cross-the-moon-review-for-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "As Ive written before, my standards for visual novels arent particularly high: I generally just ask that they tell an interesting story, and ask a little more of players than simply pressing X to move the story forward. The really good ones do more than that, of course, but thats the bare level of competence that I look for.At some level, Cross the Moon fails that test. There are no choices to be found here, no branching storylines: it asks nothing of you than you read it all the way through. From that perspective, the game is no different than The Language of Love  and thats possibly the worst visual novel Ive ever experienced.And yet, somehow, Cross the Moon manages to come off as a lot more than that. Whether you want to chalk that up to the story, or the aesthetic, or the visuals, its clear that this is pretty good, as visual novels go, even if it only asks the bare minimum of players.Lets take the story, for starters. Rather than simply being your standard anime tale about teenage love, Cross the Moon is a bonkers story involving vampires, and murder, and shady corporations, and corruption, and a big, complex mystery. I wouldnt say that its always the easiest story to follow over its 6+-hour runtime, and there are times where it kind of goes off the rails, but its far more interesting than the vast majority of visual novels Ive played.On top of that, Cross the Moon is much more visually interesting than the vast majority of visual novels Ive ever seen. It uses real photos as the backdrop for this insane world  and, more importantly, it uses photos that help build on the creepy vibe the game is trying to create. The pictures are all artsy and weirdly coloured, so youre constantly left on edge.Further, the characters here arent anything like the usual anime tropes that tend to populate visual novels. Theyre drawn in pencil and generally black & white, making them stand out against the strange backgrounds. They feel sort of realistic, but at the same time not at all, and, like everything else here, its all very unsettling.", "date": "August 17, 2021", "grade": "B"}
