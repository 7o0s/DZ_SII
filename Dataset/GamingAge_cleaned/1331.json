{"name": "Submerged", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/09/submerged-review-for-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "Theres a very easy way to determine whether youll enjoy Submerged: is climbing your favourite part of Uncharted? Do you like the parkour elements of Assassins Creed more than anything else in that series? If yes, then Submerged will be right up your alley. If not, youll probably hate it.I know thats a pretty simplistic way of looking at things, but Submerged is a pretty simplistic game. Theres no combat. No enemies. No clock or timer looming over your head. No dialogue. No way to die. Its just you and your boat, exploring a citys waterlogged ruins.Admittedly, theres a bit of a story pushing everything forward: youre looking for supplies to help save your brothers life. And that, in turn, informs your in-game actions, at least to an extent  your exploration will end up being driven largely by telltale glimpses of shiny objects (which indicate emergency rations are close by) and red flowers (which mean youll be able to climb into the ruined building to look around).But it only pushes you forward to the extent you let it. Without a clock, you can simply drift around the city for days on end, taking in the sights and occasional sounds of a drowned, mostly deserted city. In fact, for players for whom the exploration is the main draw, finding rations may actually be a disincentive, since once you uncover those the game automatically cuts your exploration short, and you instantly get taken back to your home base and your brother.This is actually a really odd design choice, since Submerged is clearly meant to be all about exploration. The developers put a lot of effort into creating a world thats meant to be discovered, with little hints of what life was like pre-disaster scattered everywhere. There are the big, obvious signs that youre looking around what used to be a thriving metropolis: the skeletal remains of a stadiums lights, a giant statue towering over everything, some gorgeous hotels. But there are also the smaller details that make the world feel lived in: a pig-shaped butcher sign here, billboards and ads ads painted on the sides of buildings there. Its things like this that transform the game from being just a pretty-looking tech demo to being something worth playing  and why I dont understand the games reasoning behind reducing the amount of time you spend looking around, particularly when its a fairly short game as it is.", "date": "September 11, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
