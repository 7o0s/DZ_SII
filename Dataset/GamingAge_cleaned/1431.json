{"name": "Project Root", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/05/project-root-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "I hate Project Root, and Im going to be totally up front as to why: I suck at it. A lot. Ive put countless hours into it, yet no matter how much I play I always feel like Im not getting any further.To be fair, part of this feeling can be chalked up to the games visuals and design. Even though Project Root is an open-world(ish) shmup (really, its more a twin-stick shooter, but theyre calling it a shmup, so its a shmup), each level is set on one, same-y looking map and calls on you to fly all over the place doing missions that can be boiled down to Go here, blow this up. Theres not a whole lot of variety in the missions or the visuals, which means the whole thing gets pretty tedious really quickly.Of course, in my case the reason I feel like Im not getting any further is less because the games layout doesnt offer much feeling of progress, and more because Im literally not getting any further. Ive died in this game more times than I can count, which means that my progress is stuck somewhere between nil and non-existent. It doesnt help that Project Root has no checkpoint system, which means that every time you die you get sent right back to the beginning to start over. Considering that most levels take at least 30-40 minutes to complete, you can see how it can very quickly start to seem as though the game is a boring exercise in treading water.Whats disappointing about this is that the games concept is a pretty neat one. As I said above, Project Root calls itself a shmup, only its unlike any shmup Ive ever played. Rather than being a unidirectional side-scroller here enemies always come at you from one side of the screen, this game gives you an overhead view and sends enemies at you from all sides. They couple this with an enormous map  one so big that, while the game may not technically live up to its description as open-world, the reality is that the map is so large and your ship so small and so slow-moving, it could practically be open-world. Taken together, the whole thing feels like the most expansive twin-stick shooter Ive ever played.As you can probably tell from that description, however, the incredibly high level of difficulty is written right into the games DNA. Not only do you have enemies constantly coming at you from all sides non-stop for about 30-40 minutes, they can also fire at you from off-screen. Plus, as you quickly discover (and then have reinforced for you again and again and again), just because your enemies have been shot down it doesnt mean that their heat seeking missiles were, too.", "date": "May 21, 2015", "grade": "C"}
