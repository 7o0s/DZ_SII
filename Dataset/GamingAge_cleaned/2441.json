{"name": "Castle on the Coast", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/01/castle-on-the-coast-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "If backstories were everything, Castle on the Coast would be a pretty solid GOTY contender. The game is built around George the Giraffe, the mascot of Valley Childrens Hospital in Madera County, California, and was created so that patients at the hospital would have something to play. Now that its for sale, some of the revenue it generates will go back into the hospital.In other words, youd have to be heartless to hate the game. So, uhhow about that Castle on the Coast? Pretty great, eh?Looking at it a little more objectively, of course, its not anywhere close to the best 3D platformer on the Switch. The jumps are a little too floaty, there are annoying invisible walls everywhere stopping you from exploring too much, and the voice acting is less-than-amazingThe games biggest problem, though, is that theres no map. The worlds arent exactly huge, but theyre large enough and lacking enough in clear landmarks that its easy to go around and around in circles, trying to figure out what youre supposed to be doing and where youre supposed to be going. On top of that, the objectives arent totally clear, which means you spend a lot of time here just wandering around.On the plus side, however, wandering isnt so bad. Yes, the jumps are floaty, but the whole thing feels dreamlike with its vividly coloured world, so it kind of fits together. Further, Castle on the Coast is, ultimately, a collectathon, so the objectives are secondary to bouncing around the world, picking up everything in sight  and the given the sheer number of collectibles to pick up, its pretty easy to sink a couple of hours into just grabbing everything in sight.And, again, its all for a good cause. Castle on the Coast may not be perfect, but its heart is in the right place. In this case, thats enough.", "date": "January 18, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
