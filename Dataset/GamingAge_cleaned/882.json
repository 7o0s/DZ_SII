{"name": "Beat Cop", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/03/beat-cop-review-pc/", "text": "Beat Cop is a new game brought to you by newcomer game studio Pixel Crow which was founded in 2014 by two developers  Maciej Miasikthey and Adam Kozlowski. Pixel Crow are releasing their first game on March 30th, 2017, which is Beat Cop. Beat Cop is a game that drops you in the role of a former detective framed for a murder and robbery. Having been denounced publicly and fired from your job, you get put into the role of being a regular street patrol officer. As you enter your first day on the job, you are instructed to follow the current officer on the road you will be patrolling from today on.As you take your tour of your road, the officer you are replacing introduces you to some of the shop owners and functions of the game you will be using for the rest of the game. The way most days in Beat Cop work has remained mostly the same for me with minor differences in what is required of you each day (I got to day 14). You will be walking up and down your street, watching for people parked illegally, or who have busted lights or worn out tires and writing them a ticket to meet your quota for each day (a lot less boring than it sounds, I promise). Within each day, you will have random events happen that are supposedly non-linear, so our stories would probably differ.", "date": "March 29, 2017", "grade": "A-"}
