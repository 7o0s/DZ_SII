{"name": "Schacht", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/06/schacht-review-for-ps4/", "text": "When you first boot up Schacht, it seems kind of promising. It looks like a fairly polished endless runner with a shiny sci-fi theme. The training levels suggest that its got tight  if somewhat limited  controls. In fact, by the time I was finished the tutorial, I was wondering if Id stumbled across some amazing hidden gem.And then I discovered that thats pretty much all there is here.Okay, thats not totally fair. Schacht also has a daily race, where you can compete against other players times. Theres an endless running mode, where you can see how long you can go, again compared to other players on a global leaderboard. There are weekly versions of both. Anduhwell, thats it.I could see a situation where this could lead to fun. If there were active leaderboards, for example, then I could potentially see why you might want to go back on a daily basis and try to perfect your run. But there arent, which means that the one thing that Schacht features outside of its tutorial is basically pointless.If Schacht were free, I could see suggesting people check it out, since it shows some promise, and it suggests that the people behind it may be worth watching. But at a price of literally any amount above zero, theres just no way youre getting your moneys worth here.", "date": "June 29, 2018", "grade": "D"}
