{"name": "Unlock the Cat", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/06/unlock-the-cat-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "There are two good things about Unlock the Cat.First, in the process of looking up the background details about this game, I learned that theres actually a name for the type of puzzle that makes up this game: Klotski puzzles. Up until writing this review, I thought they were just sliding block puzzles  so, thanks to Unlock the Cat, I learned something new.The second is that rather than simply moving blocks around to try to free a specific one, as the games name implies youre moving blocks around to free a cat. As Ive written before, I love cats, so putting them at the centre of the game is a good way to make me enjoy it more.Beyond those two things, though, theres not a lot in Unlock the Cat that makes it different from any other sliding block puzzles  sorry, Klotski puzzles. The layout is the same, and the puzzles are the same. While I like seeing cats, the ones in here are perhaps a little too catlike, in that theyre also very slow to move when you want them to. It feels like you have to drag them backwards and forwards, which, aside from feeling kind of cruel, makes the game feel slower than it should.Obviously, Unlock the Cat isnt terrible, since its a functional game, and it works exactly like every other version of this basic puzzle works. But unless the only thing stopping you from playing Klotski puzzles was the general lack of cats, theres really nothing here thatll make it worth your while.", "date": "June 3, 2022", "grade": "C-"}
