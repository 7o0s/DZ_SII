{"name": "Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/epic-mickey-2-the-power-of-two-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "The simple fact of Epic Mickey 2s existence on the Vita is, to be frank, bizarre. The original version for PS3/Xbox 360/Wii/Wii U came out eight months ago to a critical reaction best described as meh, and even though it appeared on four times as many consoles as the original Epic Mickey, it sold only about one-third as many copies. I speak from personal experience when I say that the game, at least the PS3 version, was pretty much the definition of bland and uninspired. Basically, if this isnt the least-demanded port of all time, its certainly in the running.All that said, Epic Mickey 2 on the Vita isnt a complete disaster. In fact, in many ways its a step up from the console versions. The porting was done, in part, by Sony themselves, which means that the people in charge of it were intimately familiar with the handheld. Consequently, any motion controls that existed on the console versions have been turned  pretty seamlessly, for the most part  into touch controls. Moreover, the game looks fantastic on the PS Vitas OLED screen, to the point that it looks less like a tired, pointless sequel (which was part of the problem with the original), and more like an actual labour of love.Unfortunately, a few enhancements here and there cant get around the fact that a port of a thoroughly mediocre game is still, ultimately, mediocre. The game is still full of pointless side quests. Touch integration notwithstanding, the controls are still a bit of a challenge, particularly when it comes to platforming. And, worst of all, the partner A.I. is abysmally bad, to the point that, unless you happen to have a friend with both a Vita and a copy of the game, you should expect to play the whole way through with only minimal assistance from your supposed ally. Considering the game is subtitled The Power of 2, thats a pretty big failure on the part of the game.", "date": "July 23, 2013", "grade": "C+"}
