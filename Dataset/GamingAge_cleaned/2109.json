{"name": "Urban Trial Freestyle", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/03/urban-trial-freestyle-review-for-ps-vita-ps3/", "text": "Urban Trial Freestyles flaws are both many and obvious. Its a blatant clone of Trials HD. Its hideously ugly. The difficulty spikes are totally random. With only a handful of tracks available, it seems short. In nearly every respect, its pretty lacking in customization options. Theres no cross-buy or cross-play between the PS3 and Vita versions. Basically, what Im trying to say is, if youre looking for reasons not to play Urban Trial Freestyle, it wont be hard to find them.Heres why you should play it, though: its really freaking addictive.Dont get me wrong, I couldnt stand the game at first. I was ready to bash it for all the reasons enumerated above, and more. And yetevery time I played it, Id find myself going back and doing tracks again, and again, and again. Id find that even after I aced one mode on a track, there were still others that I hadnt yet mastered. Invariably, Id look up at some point, and see that Id suddenly lost an hour or two. If that doesnt speak to the game being at least passably enjoyable, I dont know what does.Of course, its entirely possible that Urban Trial Freestyle isnt a particularly worthwhile investment, and that its combination of leaderboards and stars simply triggered a Pavlovian gaming response that I was powerless to resist. Or, alternatively, maybe its actually a good game?", "date": "March 5, 2013", "grade": "B"}
