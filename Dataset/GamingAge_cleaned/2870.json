So Ill just say this: meh.What, not enough? Fine. RogueCube is a top-down, twin-stick shooter where, as the name implies, you play as a cube. There are a couple of cubes with different abilities to choose from at first, and you gradually unlock more as you go along. You also start off with one weapon, and, again, unlock more as you go along. There are three modes, and all of them are more or less the same  though I will acknowledge that the Versus mode could potentially be fun, in the same way that any shooter with local multiplayer is fun, but I dont have three other controllers to test that out (nor, given the whole pandemic thing, would I be able to have three other players join me for local multiplayer, but thats beside the point).Honestly, theres really not much to say about this game. Without any story, theres nothing drawing you in. The cubes dont have much personality, slightly different abilities notwithstanding. The levels all look pretty similar. Theres not even the promise of a quick and easy Platinum, like there is with most Ratalaika games, since there are a couple of trophies here that are actually kind of challenging to get.", "date": "September 23, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
