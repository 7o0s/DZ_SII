It looked and playedwell, like a mobile game trying to be more than that. Too much of it felt like you were just being asked to do the same thing, over and over again. While you didnt have to pay anything extra to win, it couldnt escape the grindier aspects of mobile gameplay. It felt like you were in a constant loop of race-upgrade-race  which, to be sure, is the case in most racers, but it felt more prominent there.Its the same way with Gear.Club Unlimited 2. In fact, if anything, its even worse here. Every second, you feel like theyre about to helpfully suggest that you can upgrade your car by buying GCU Cash (or something along those lines), since they place so much emphasis on improving your car. Finish a race? Back to the garage for upgrades! About to start a race? Have you thought about going to the garage for an upgrade?Of course, the constant upgrades may just seem more prominent here because it serves to highlight one of Gear.Club Unlimited 2s worst aspects: the load times. Its impossible to go from one place to the next without waiting, and waiting, and waiting. From the garage to the track, from the track to the map, it doesnt matter  youll always be watching the progress bar race to 95%, and then stop for a couple of minutes. This is a problem because, notwithstanding the games promise of a huge playing area, you cant actually go anywhere without going through a cutscene or two. The map, the tracks, the garage  theyre all separate. Consequently, youll be seeing that loading screen a lot, and itll bother you more and more every time.In the games defense, I guess, the races themselves all work perfectly fine. They never stutter or skip, and you dont have to worry about lag between your controller and the screen. Mind you, itd be pretty insane if you did  these tracks are as boring as they come. Again, despite Gear.Club Unlimited 2s promise of diverse environments, youll notice theres a lot of repetition from race to race. The game may try to disguise that fact by playing around with times of day and weather, but once you notice how bland the tracks are, you wont be able to ignore it. Sure, they look nice enough, but theyre distinctly lacking in character.It could be worse, I guess. Gear.Club Unlimited 2 couldve suffered from the same fate as Asphalt Injection and been grind-heavy and ugly. Instead, youve got a game thats just grind-heavy and boring. It works, which is nice, but with these load times, working feels like the least the game should do. The best games have some kind of exciting spark to them, and thats one thing Gear.Club Unlimited 2 completely lacks.", "date": "January 24, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
