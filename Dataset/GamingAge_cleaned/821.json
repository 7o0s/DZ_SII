{"name": "The Deer God", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/06/the-deer-god-review-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "I feel a little bad about not liking The Deer God more than I do. Its all about the importance of respecting nature, and the core message is that animals deserve respect and compassion. You play as a human turned into a deer by the eponymous deer god, punishment for shooting one of its kind. As someone whos a staunch environmentalist and whos been a vegan for more than a decade, thats a moral I can get behind.However, thats about all I can get behind when it comes to The Deer God. Its dull and repetitive, a game in which youre constantly galloping forward across the screen. Occasionally you can pause to engage in lacklustre combat, solve a dull puzzle, or converse with random people and animals to take on new quests. None of these brief respites from running add all that much to the game, beyond the simple fact that pausing your run means you can take in some of the gorgeous artwork.In fact, thats just about the only reason I can think of for why you might want to check this game out: it features some beautiful pixelated art. Given that its all 8-bit its somewhat sparse, but at any given point in the game, you can stop and marvel at how much care and attention The Deer Gods designers put into creating this world. It doesnt make up for an otherwise underwhelming experience, but at the very least it makes that underwhelming experience slightly more tolerable.", "date": "June 5, 2017", "grade": "C-"}
