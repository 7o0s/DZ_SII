{"name": "de Blob 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/04/de-blob-2-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "As I wrote not too long ago, the original de Blob was one of my favourite Wii games, and, when it was re-released on current-gen consoles, I was pleased to discover that my memories were entirely accurate. It was still loads of fun, and its bright colours and funky music looked and sounded even better on a modern system.Jump ahead a few years, and the first part of that previous paragraph holds true for de Blob 2, just with PS3 subbed in for Wii. It, too, was one of my favourite games on its particular console  in part because it was fun, but also because it updated the originals look, feel, and mechanics for a more powerful system.Id like to say that my feelings towards de Blob 2 on Xbox One are exactly the same as they were for de Blob on Xbox One, but that wouldnt be entirely accurate. I still really like it, but, at the same time, I cant help but feel like this newer game is something of a letdown.To some extent, this may simply be a case of franchise fatigue. The two games were originally released three years apart, which is practically an eternity in video game time. These two remastered versions, by contrast, were released less than six months apart. Not only that, the difference between de Blob and de Blob 2 were enormous, not least because of the jump from the Wii to PS3. Again, by comparison, the difference between the remastered de Blob and the remastered de Blob 2 is pretty much non-existent.That said, to say that de Blob 2 isnt worth checking out would be to do it a disservice. Sure, its basically the same game as de Blob, just with a little more handholding near the beginning. But de Blob was a very, very good 3D platformer, and replicating everything it did well is a pretty impressive feat.In fact, in some ways, de Blob 2 even improves upon its predecessor. It has a much improved camera, more frequent save points, and cutscenes that dont show their age, all of which count as plusses in my book. Further, it allows a second player to join in the fun, which is a welcome addition for a game like this one.None of these changes represent massive steps forward, to be sure. But they all contribute towards making de Blob 2 every bit as enjoyable as the original de Blob. If you missed it the first time around, or even if you loved the first re-release and just want more of the same, youd be wise to pick this one up.", "date": "April 30, 2018", "grade": "A-"}
