It was developed by Snapshot Games, a studio founded by Julian Gollopwho created XCOM back in 1997. Whatever complaints could be made about a smaller studio wholly ripping off a well-known game dont apply here. If the guy who created XCOM wants to make a new game thats basically exactly the same as XCOM, hes earned that right.But that doesnt necessarily mean the game is worth getting. In fact, Im not sure why youd want to get Phoenix Point when XCOM 2 is already available on the same platforms. Im not usually one to complain or care about which game came first, but in this case, Phoenix Point copies XCOM 2 so closely that its hard to tell what the real difference is between the two.To be fair, its worth acknowledging Phoenix Point tweaks the formula a little here and there. Its worlds are procedurally generated, which applies to not only the maps, but also your enemies  as the game explains, youre fighting against a virus that has caused people to mutate, and no two mutations are totally alike. Phoenix Point also gives you a little more freedom in combat, allowing you to free aim at enemies, which means you get to target specific body parts rather than spraying shots in their general direction. The game also has a complex diplomacy system, which gives you the option of building alliances or simply building up your military might.While these changes are all well and good, in practice they dont feel all that different from what you can do in XCOM. Its still a turn-based tactical combat game, which means that the actual gameplay is completely identical  you shoot, you shield yourself, you outflank your enemies. Being given the option of aiming for an arm versus aiming for the head doesnt feel different in the slightest.In fact, thats the complaint that could be applied to everything in Phoenix Point: it doesnt feel different in the slightest. All the talk of new systems and alliances and whatnot cant cover up the fact that its simply reinventing XCOM. And, again, if the creator of XCOM wants to remake XCOM again, he can, but it still doesnt mean that you have any reason to go out and get Phoenix Point.", "date": "October 18, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
