{"name": "NekoBuro  Catsblock", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/07/nekoburo-catsblock-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "While I obviously dont have many issues with the Vitas catalogue, I do wish that the handhelds selection of Japanese games had more like NekoBuro  Catsblock, and fewer that fall into the whole pervy teens save the world from demons category. Dont get me wrong, I think theres a time and place for the likes of Monster Monpiece and Conception II, but Id be lying if they didnt feel a little squicky, too.By contrast, theres nothing squicky at all about NekoBuro . Its really more Squee! Or aww. Or adorbs. Or, if you want proper English, so cute. Its a game where youre helping square-shaped space cats find their kitty friends. Provided you have a soul, how can that not reduce you to a giggling pile of goo?It should be noted, of course, that the actual gameplay will be familiar to anyone whos ever played a match-3 game before. You try to line the kitties up, and get them off the board when you line three in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. There are power-ups to factor in, too: some get rid of 33 squares, others remove entire rows and columns, and so on. As I said, if youve ever played a match-3 game before, youll be able to catch on here pretty quickly  which is a good thing, seeing as the games whole story mode can be beaten in just a few hoursBut really, NekoBuros gameplay is secondary to its absolutely adorable framing device. The cats are all housed in a room, and the more levels you beat the more you can unlock to put in that room. Sometimes you get new furniture, sometimes you get new cat toys, sometimes you get new cat bios: whatever the end result, it only adds to the unbelievable cuteness.", "date": "July 22, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
