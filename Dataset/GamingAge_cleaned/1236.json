{"name": "Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/12/dariusburst-chronicle-saviours-review-ps4-ps-vita/", "text": "As I wrote a few months ago about Shutshimi, Ive always felt pretty indifferent to shmups. I think theyre fine in small doses but after awhile, everything starts to feel the same.That, in a nutshell, was why I loved Shutshimi so much. And, more relevantly, its why I literally fell asleep playing Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours.Admittedly, I was already a little sleepy when it happened, so its not like Dariusburst should get all the blame here. Not only that, I should probably emphasize that my reaction is undoubtedly atypical, since generally theres so much happening on the screen at any one time, its very, very hard to not be visually stimulated, if not outright overwhelmed. Between the abundance of enemies and the vibrant colours, youre more likely to feel like your senses are under attack than you are to feel bored.My issue, however, is with the amount of content here, rather than the content itself. Simply put, theres way more game here than there needs to be. I mean, Im all in favor of giving people too much to do rather than too little, but Dariusburst features well over 3,000 levels.Just for emphasis: three thousand levels.I suppose this wouldnt be so bad if there was some kind of variation between those three thousand levels. But generally, if youve played one level here, youve played them all: you shoot your way through several dozen enemy spaceships and meteors, you grab a few power-ups, you battle a giant space robot fish boss. Repeat that a couple of thousand times, and suddenly youve experienced everything this game has to offer.Obviously, your feelings on Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours will differ from mine greatly if youre more favourably inclined towards shmups in general. If you like the prospect of getting a few thousand shots at refining your shmup abilities without the hassle of changing games, then this is absolutely the game for you. Its visually appealing, the controls are intuitive, and its pretty well-made overall.", "date": "December 15, 2015", "grade": "B"}
