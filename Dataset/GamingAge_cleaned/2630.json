{"name": "Legends of Ethernal", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/06/legends-of-ethernal-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Every single time I started playing Legends of Ethernal, I fell into a pretty predictable pattern: Id play for a couple of hours, get bored, and stop playing, and then Id come back to it and realize Id forgotten everything and had to start over again. If it happened once or twice Id chalk it up to my own short attention span, but by the fourth or fifth time, I have to lay some of the blame on the game.In the games defense, Legends of Ethernal is built around a thoughtful story that really requires you to play for several hours and get invested in the main character, a young boy named Wilfred whos trying to rescue his parents. Along the way, you have to kill all sorts of vicious creatures  and  SPOILERS AHEAD  at a certain point, the game starts calling you out for being so bloodthirsty. Its an interesting twist, to be sure, and it kind of makes you think about some of the tropes the game is built around. END SPOILER.Or, at least, it would if it werent for just how aggressive literally every enemy in Legends of Ethernal seems to be. Even playing on relaxed mode, I could barely take a few steps without something flying out of the sky or jumping out of the grass, trying to kill me. Whats more, if you leave a screen and come back to it, youll discover that the enemies have respawned, and are just as aggressively trying to kill you. In fact, even when you die several times and the game offers to help, it doesnt do so in any way that makes it easier to any discernible degree.Whats especially frustrating about this is that the combat and the hit detection is so all over the place. Your weapon swings are fairly imprecise, verging on useless, while meanwhile, even the most basic enemies can swoop at you and knock off some of your health while you flail ineffectually. Theres surely something in there about the nature of combat and learning to fight as a young boy, but its frustrating enough that youll probably ignore the message and focus on the annoyingness of it all (or, at least, I did).I get that Legends of Ethernal is really trying to be heartfelt in its story, and tries back that up with hand-crafted graphics that are supposed to make you feel all warm and fuzzy towards the game. But it undercuts the vibe its going for with a punishing difficulty level and lousy combat. Maybe thats enough to win over masochists with a soft spot for a very specific art style, but personally, I think Ill just pass.", "date": "June 11, 2021", "grade": "C+"}
