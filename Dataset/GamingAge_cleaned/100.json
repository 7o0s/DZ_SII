While I wouldnt be so churlish as to suggest it should have stayed there rather than making the jump to the Switch, I will say that I dont think anyone would have noticed if it had.Its not that its a bad game or anything. Its just that if youve played one level  or, for that matter, one dungeon within a level  youve basically played them all. You go in a small room, you hack and slash all the monsters and treasure chests, and then you move on to the next one. Eventually youll reach a boss, which is defeated bymore hacking and slashing. Trouserheart is nothing if not repetitive.Actually, thats not entirely true. Its also got a cute sense of humour. The games premise is that youre a king whos had his pants stolen by gremlins. At the end of each level, you get a Mario-esque Sorry, but your pants are in another castle (or some variation thereof). While thats clearly not enough to sustain a whole game  since, again, the gameplay itself gets pretty repetitive pretty quickly  it does ensure youll have a slight grin on your face during your short time with the game.Mind you, I still dont think thats enough to justify the games existence on the Switch, particularly when its twice as much as it is on mobile. If youre in the mood for a game where you almost literally do nothing other than spamming your attack button for a couple of hours and getting not much out of it, Trouserheart may be the right game for you, but it feels like there are much better ways to spend your time and money.", "date": "August 16, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
