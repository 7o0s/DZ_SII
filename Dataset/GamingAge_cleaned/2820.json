Whatever you thought of that game  and for the record, I liked it  youll think of this game, too, since theyre basically identical.Obviously, given that were talking about a budget indie game, chances are that previous paragraph wont mean all that much to you, so Ill give a little background for the uninitiated. Much like the last Midnight game, Birthday of Midnight is essentially a golf game, only instead of trying to get the ball in the hole, here youre trying to get the eponymous Midnight  a white square  into a hole. While the levels start out fairly straightforward, gradually the game adds in things like bombs, spikes, and other environmental hazards.As far as I could tell, the only difference between Birthday of Midnight and Midnight Deluxe is that, this time out, the Platinum doesnt pop until level 50, rather than level 40. However, much like the last time around, this means its possible to get all the trophies without even touching a significant number of levels. While I appreciate getting the Platinum without having to touch the games harder levels, it still feels like it shortchanges the game a little, since those levels are worth playing too.In other words, its exactly the same game as before, only with slightly different levels. Given that there was nothing wrong the last time around  and that the game is still less than $5  that means that Birthday of Midnight is a pleasant enough diversion if youve got a couple of dollars and an hour to spare.", "date": "November 17, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
