{"name": "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/11/call-duty-advanced-warfare-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "At this point you should have a pretty good idea of what youre going to get out of a Call of Duty release. Fast-paced gunfights, generally solid multiplayer, a loud, bombastic campaign, and a whole lot of military jargon being tossed about. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is no different in that sense. Following the release of Ghosts, its clearly a better looking game. It seems obvious that developer Sledgehammer Games focused primarily on current-gen platforms, and visually Advanced Warfare benefits from that focus. I have no idea how the game fares on 360 or PS3, but on Xbox One, it looks really great.But what else does Advanced Warfare bring to the table? The biggest and best addition here is the Exo-Suit, specifically the changes in movement that come along with it. With the Exo-Suit, youll be able to make short dashes in an effort to quickly get behind cover, while also allowing for limited double-jumps and the ability to slow your descent from long falls. In addition to quicker movement and more verticality, youll be able to quickly cross waist-high objects, move in and out of windows, and climb up small ledges when jumping towards them. Everything on the movement side of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare feels quicker, more precise, and certainly more fun to control.The impact of this on the campaign-side is a bit limited. Youll have various sequences where youll be required to use the Exo-Suit to leap over high objects or avoid other hazards. Theres unfortunately not a lot of opportunity to freestyle within the campaign, but when it comes to multiplayer its a very different story. I think youll be surprised by how changed the MP side of the game feels compared to Advanced Warfares predecessors. Its not as ground-breaking as the excellent movement found in something like Titanfall, but it is a step in the right direction for this series.I also genuinely enjoyed the campaign this time around. A bit of thats aided by the solid performance of one Kevin Spacey, marking one of the few occasions getting a well-known, talented actor has worked out to a be a positive for a video games story. Call of Duty has certainly flirted with celebrities before, but Spacey fits in pretty naturally as the CEO of Atlas, the PMC organization at the center of Advanced Warfares plot. The story isnt going to be confused for high-brow entertainment, but outside of the groan inducing, well-publicized Press X to pay respects bit, youll remain entertained throughout the 6 to 7 hour rollercoaster ride the campaign serves up.While the framing of Advanced Warfares multiplayer is generally similar to the brand formula that began with Call of Duty 4, theres a few neat perks and additions. The aforementioned changes to movement are certainly the star here, but theres a decent amount of character customization as well. As you level up and play matches youll occasionally obtain care packages, which provide you with new cosmetic items and weapons, typically special variants on existing models. The cosmetic gear items are pretty varied, allowing you to make your online avatar stand out from the rest of the crowd. Weapons are certainly more important, introducing some minor stat changes affecting how the weapon performs. Some might not care for the randomness involved with these care packages, but for me it serves as a decent hook, ensuring that I want to play just one more match to see what might be around the corner.The competitive multiplayer side of Advanced Warfare comes with a number of modes, mostly culled from past entries in the series. Standard favorites like Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed are present, Capture the Flag and Hardpoint return from Black Ops 2, while Uplink is a new mode for the series. All in all theres around 12 modes across 13 different maps, which seems like a decent amount to keep you entertained in the coming months. It falls a bit shy of Ghosts when it comes to core content at launch, but the differences in gameplay are exciting enough to make up for that loss.However, your experience with Advanced Warfares multiplayer might be hit or miss. While Ive had zero issues joining games across all modes, including the cooperative 4-player mode, I have seen a fair share of lag. Even when theres no noticeable connection issues on my side, or with anyone in the match, Ive had a number of matches that turned into near slideshows at different points. Its not consistently an issue, but its certainly enough to be annoyance. This comes a week after launch as well, along with a patch introduced yesterday meant to improve this issue. While the patch seems to have cut down on the problem, it definitely has not fixed it entirely.", "date": "November 14, 2014", "grade": "B"}
