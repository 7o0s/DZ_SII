{"name": "Lichdom: Battlemage", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/07/lichdom-battlemage-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "WellLichdom: Battlemage couldve been worse.For example, it couldve somehow given your console a virus. It couldve triggered mass seizures, along the lines of that infamous Pokmon episode. If were not being facetious, it couldve been The Park, for example, or Murasaki Mist.Of course, its that last line that gives away just how terrible Lichdom: Battlemage is. The Park and Murasaki Mist are, as far as Im concerned, the two top contenders for worst game of 2016. Being a small step above games of that ilk barely constitutes an achievement. Lichdom: Battlemage is so bad, if games were people it would look at The Technomancer and say, Man, I wish I could be that good. (Note: The Technomancer sucks.)Its not for nothing that Digital Foundry declared Lichdom: Battlemage to be the worst-looking game theyd ever seen. Even though its received a patch that theoretically fixed things, this game still looks horrendous. Im not one to talk about, care about or even notice things like framerates, but considering you cant even turn around in this game without everything stuttering and freezing, I totally see where theyre coming from.And its not like this game has super-demanding graphics, either. The environments are as stereotypically medieval as they come. Its as if Lichdoms developers saw Skyrim, thought to themselves, Yeah, I want that!, then put everything off until a week before their work was due, at which point they decided to recreate their vague recollections from memory with the intent of having it run on a PS2. The characters in this game fare no better, looking like stock art that youd get if you Googled medieval people. In fact, seeing as the skeleton enemies look like they stepped out of some Intro to 3D models class from the mid- to late-90s, it wouldnt shock me if they were the result of some particularly lazy Googling.Seeing as barely any care or attention went into Lichdom: Battlemages visuals, it should come as no surprise that the voice acting is also equal parts lackadaisical and non-ironically retro. The main character  provided you decide to play as a woman  also sounds like she was recently thawed out after being frozen in the 90s, with a weird hybrid accent thats equal parts post-Valley Girl/Clueless and Chandler from Friends.She doesnt have a whole lot to work with, mind you. Id say that the dialogue here sounds like it was written by someone whose first language wasnt English, only that would be a huge insult to pretty much every single other language in the world, since I doubt that any of them sound as stilted and forced as the people in this game do.Then again, youd probably sound stilted too, if you were forced to give voice to the boring, nonsensical drek that tries to pass itself off as a story.Id be able to overlook all of these massive negatives, however, if the action was at least fun. After all, for all its many, many flaws, Lichdom: Battlemage has one thing going for it: an interesting idea. It feels like someone, somewhere, found themselves inspired by the initial demo for the PlayStation Move game Sorcery, and wanted to apply the basic concept  of you controlling a magician  to the first-person shooter genre. As someone who was disappointed by Sorcery and who wishes that the Harry Potter franchise had ever gotten a game that was half as interesting as the books, I love that idea. In fact, I think that, in the right hands, it couldve led to one of the most amazing games ever. Now, read everything thats come before this paragraph. Do you think that the people behind Lichdom: Battlemage count as the right hands?Spoiler: they dont. This becomes apparent very early on, when you discover that the way to get through this game is to simply hold down the shoulder button and shoot off fire spells at everything that gets in your way. Theres no such thing as, nor is there any room for, subtlety or nuance. Its as if youve been given the most overpowered shotgun ever, as well as unlimited ammo, and told to just go to town on every enemy you see. However fun that may be at first, it gets old very, very quickly.Not too quickly, though, because in between pretty much everything of consequence, youre forced to sit through all kinds of interminable loading screens. Turn the game on: loading screen. Press a button to start: loading screen. Do anything from the menu: loading screen. Start playing: extra-long loading screen. If all the waiting led to something amazing, it might be possible to argue that at least the loading screens are an okay trade-off, but when this is what you get out of it, that argument becomes a lot harder to make.", "date": "July 11, 2016", "grade": "D-"}
