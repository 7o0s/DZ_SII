Play it long enough, and itll start feeling a little repetitive  and not just because, as a puzzle game, youre expected to do the same thing over and over again. Rather, you start seeing the same patterns repeated regularly. Crossovers is designed to be a mix between a crossword and a jumble: youre given sets of word pairs, you find the letters where each pair intersect, and you use the resulting letters to form words. Its all pretty intuitive, even if Ive made it seem more complex than it actually is.The problem is that the game often resorts to using the same pairs. If you see tri_e and glo_e, you know its going to be a B. Likewise, any time ma_or shows up, its so you can get a J or a Y. For one or two puzzles across the 200 here, that would have been fine; that the repeats showed up often enough for me to notice says something about the game.Or, alternatively, it says something about me and how much I enjoyed Crossovers that I ploughed through all 200 puzzles in under a day.That, I suspect, should be my actual takeaway from this game. Even the most challenging jumbles can be solved in under five minutes, and many can be solved in a minute or so, which means  if youre a admitted word nerd like me  that its very easy to get sucked in and find out that youve just spent an hour solving dozens of word puzzles.Which, in turn, means my real complaint about Crossovers is that its over far too soon. Occasional repetition or not, its designed to be addictive for a certain type of person (i.e. me), and before long, youll reach the end and wish there was still more to do. If thats not the sign of a game worth checking out (and, perhaps, that Lightwood Games may want to think about some DLC), I dont know what is.", "date": "May 14, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
