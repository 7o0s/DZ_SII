{"name": "#RaceDieRun", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/09/racedierun-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Despite #RaceDieRuns modern-sounding name, it feels like it owes its existence to a pair of much older games.The first is obvious: it presents itself as a futuristic racer, so the comparison to F-Zero (or, I guess, Wipeout, if you want something a little more modern) feels almost perfunctory. This has some merit, since youre piloting a hovering racecar, but seeing as its a single-player game, and youre really only racing against yourself, it doesnt quite capture what this game is all about.No, to really get an understanding of #RaceDieRun, you need to look to Battletoads. More specifically, you need to look at those near-impossible Turbo Tunnel levels, which are less about racing and more about getting your timing just right as the world zooms past you. Obviously, #RaceDieRun looks a whole lot more modern. But its devotion to killing players as much as possible via annoyingly-placed rock walls could have been lifted straight out the adventures of Rash, Zitz, and Pimple.Of course, that leads to the question of why anyone would want to play #RaceDieRun. At best, I think, most people found those levels to be an exercise in frustration, something that youd tolerate because the rest of the game was so much fun. Now just imagine an entire game full of those levels, and you can see why #RaceDieRun manages to hit the not-so-sweet-spot between frustrating and painfully repetitive.In the games defense, it does what it sets out to do relatively well. The controls are as tight as they need to be  which, in this case, is quite a bit, since you have to make all kinds of tight turns.But just because its fine for what it is doesnt make #RaceDieRun any more interesting. Unless you have a masochistic desire to crash a whole bunch, your interest in being challenged will probably wane long, long before this game is over.", "date": "September 17, 2019", "grade": "C-"}
