If youve played one of them before, ever, on any system, youll have gotten the full experience of what this game has to offer. The Keeper of the 4 Elements doesnt add in anything new, nor does it throw in some crazy twist. It just gives you a map, a variety of enemies moving along set pathways, and towers of varying abilities. This isnt a game looking to reinvent the wheel.The theme, such as it is, is that theres a wizard involved, so that explains how you get towers shooting the titular four elements. It also covers why you can summon storms of various sorts. I guess if thats the kind of thing thats bothered you about other tower defense games, you can be happy The Keeper of the 4 Elements answers your question. Ive never stopped to ponder that, so, needless to say, it leaves me indifferent.", "date": "December 29, 2016", "grade": "C-"}
