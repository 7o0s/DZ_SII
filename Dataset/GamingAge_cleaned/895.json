{"name": "Her Majestys Spiffing", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/03/majestys-spiffing-review-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "Fun fact about Her Majestys Spiffing: I probably spent more time thinking about what I was going to say in this review and writing it than I actually spent playing the game.This is not, unfortunately, because I only played the game for a few brief moments and then dashed this review off. Rather, its because Her Majestys Spiffing is unbelievably short.Now, I dont want to give the impression that I believe that game length is the be-all and end-all of a games value. Of course quality counts for at least as much as quantity, and of course how much fun you had playing a game should count for more than how much time you spent playing it.Moreover, I dont want to give the impression that whats on offer in Her Majestys Spiffing is bad by any means. Its got a pretty decent sense of humour, and seems like the kind of thing that Tim Schafer would come up with if hed been born on the other side of the Atlantic. On top of that, it has a fun premise: a post-Brexit UK, tired of living on a post-British Empire Earth, decides to set off into space to find planets to colonize. Combine the humour and the premise, and it should come as no surprise that the story  while it lasts  is pretty enjoyable.The gameplay isnt too bad either. True, its your pretty standard point & click adventure, but the combinations and demands generally make sense, and because the action is mostly confined to a few rooms in a small spaceship, youre not wandering around aimlessly and clicking on everything you come across. Everything in Her Majestys Spiffing is perfectly logical, which seems like one of the highest compliments you can pay an adventure game.Despite all this, though, I have to go back to the games one giant, glaring flaw: its ridiculously short. Buying the game at full price on either Xbox One or PS4 will set you back about $20 (the PC version, as of this writing, is about half that), and in return youll be getting a game that you can completely finish in an hour. Even if youre like me, and youre of an age where you appreciate games that dont require a massive time investment, Id say thats a little on the short side.", "date": "March 8, 2017", "grade": "B"}
