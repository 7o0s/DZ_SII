(Of course, if youre really into these things, youve probably already downloaded Atelier Totori.)You see, Im coming into the game without any previous experience with the Atelier series  or even with anime in general, to be honest. Truth be told, my interest in the game stemmed almost entirely from the way it was stealth released onto the PlayStation Store with literally no advance warning. I figured that any game that received so little pre-release publicity was either going to be abysmally terrible (and its stealth release was a sign of Tecmo Koei trying to fulfill some kind of contractual obligations) or surprisingly awesome (and its stealth release was a sign ofsomething unfathomable).While youd think abysmally terrible was the only possible option in this case (because, after all, why would someone release a good game and not tell anyone?), it turns out the truth is much, much closer to surprisingly awesome.Of course, a big part of the reason its such a surprise is because Atelier Totori Plus is so proudly insular. Initially, everything about the game seems to be pitched solely at its pre-existing audience. It looks and sounds like your stereotypical creepy Japanese game: several of the characters are extremely young-looking girls in very short skirts, theres some weird talk about massages, and the bonus for early adopters is a set of angel and devil bikini costumes (download the game before April 16th to get yours!).On top of that, the gameplay doesnt really go out of its way to explain itself. Yes, it tells you the basics  you form a party to fight monsters, you gather ingredients, you mix the results together to craft all sorts of things  but if youre not used to this style of game, youll mostly be left to figure things out on your own. For someone like me, who likes obviously linear gameplay and no small amount of handholding, playing through Atelier Totori Plus proved to be a bit of a challenge.At some point, though, the craziest thing happened: I found myself addicted. While I cant say that I ever totally figured out what I was doing, I was able to figure out enough to get by  and at that point, I was hooked. Hours literally disappeared as I tried to gather just the right combinations of ingredients. And while the creepiness of playing as a young, somewhat scantily-dressed girl never totally went away, it wasnt something I even noticed within a few hours because I was so focused on grinding through levels and quests.", "date": "April 8, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
