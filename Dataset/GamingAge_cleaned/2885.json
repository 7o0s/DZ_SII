{"name": "A Summer with the Shiba Inu", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/09/a-summer-with-the-shiba-inu-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Theres a heck of a lot going on in A Summer with the Shiba Inu. Its a visual novel that jumps back and forth across decades, with a story involving magical feathers, a massive augmented reality murder simulation, double-crosses, and all kinds of other crazy stuff, and it just keeps piling on more and more the further in you get.Also, all the characters are dogs.Part of me wonders if A Summer with the Shiba Inu isnt just some elaborate excuse to squeeze in as many dog-rated puns as its developers could come up with into a single game . The main character, Syd, has returned to the island of Taipaw after living for many years in Canine-da. All the characters say things like For Dogs sake and dog-darned. You can earn a trophy called Beaglenetta 3, and the trophy description includes a reference to Paw-tal 3. Point being, you better have a very healthy appetite for dog puns if you wanto to enjoy this game  and even as someone who loves puns, I found them to be a little much.The thing is, theres way too much going on in A Summer with the Shiba Inu for it to merely be an in-joke gone a little too far. Even if the puns are a bit much, the developers have gone to great lengths to imagine what a world populated by dogs would look like. Nearly every logo seems to have a paw on it, there are lots of touchscreens, and doorknobs are a weird relic from the past.Moreover, this game features a crazy amount of dogs-dressed-as-humans, and theyve gone to the trouble of giving every dog different facial expressions depending on what the story is calling for. Were not talking about anything insane as far as graphics go  in true visual novel fashion, speaking characters slide on and off the screen  but theres still a lot of characters here, and all of them have different outfits, so it doesnt seem like its the sort of thing that couldve just been thrown together on a lark.And, of course, theres the story itself. While A Summer with the Shiba Inu isnt as long as some visual novels Ive played, its definitely lengthy enough that itll keep you occupied for a good chunk of the day, if you want to see it all the way through to its 10+ endings.In fact, if the game has a drawback, its that its a little too elaborate for its own good. As plot piles upon plot and characters and twists get introduced and you jump back and forth across the games timeline, you may find that its all a little too much to keep track of. I wouldnt say that A Summer with the Shiba Inu is too complicated to understand by any means, but its definitely not as lighthearted and silly as you might expect from a game where dogs dress and act like people.", "date": "September 7, 2020", "grade": "B"}
