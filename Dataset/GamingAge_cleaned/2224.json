In my defense it was more than six years ago, and it would be an understatement to say a lot has happened over that time.That said, based on my previous review, it seems like Heroes of Loot 2 has a lot in common with its predecessor. It, too, is a roguelike twin-stick dungeon-crawler, full of frantic action where you fight your way through room after room, clearing out monsters and picking up all the loot you can.The difference this time out is that theres a tiny bit of strategy, since you have two fighters at your disposal  one who has range-based abilities, and the other, a warrior. Consequently, you have to decide when you want to fly into rooms, hitting everything that moves, or if you want to sit back and little and fight them all from a distance.Even if Heroes of Loot 2 has a lot in common with its predecessor, Ive got to be honest: I dont feel the same kind of over-the-top love that I evidently felt for the first game.I mean, Heroes of Loot 2 is fine. It moves along at a nice pace, it adds in a bit of nice strategic elements, and its got a fun retro vibe. But there arent really any hidden depths (not counting all the hidden dungeon rooms) here, so it feels like once youve played it a few times, the game doesnt have all that much more to offer. Its okay if thats all youre after, but its all very much a case of what you see is exactly what you get.", "date": "March 11, 2022", "grade": "B"}
