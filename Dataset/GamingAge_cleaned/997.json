There are undoubtedly some exceptions (like Shutshimi), but for the most part, I find they get repetitive pretty quickly.Theres nothing in Sky Force Anniversary that makes me think I need to rethink that position.That doesnt mean its a bad game or anything. Its perfectly fine for what it is. In fact, I have no doubt that if youre a shmup fan, youll find it to be perfectly adequate. The controls are simple, the objectives are straightforward, and it looks about as good as it needs to.The thing is, thats all it has to offer. Theres not a whole lot of variation in the enemies, nor in the environments  its lots of planes over water, and a few boats and islands to mix things up. The weapons are equally bland, unless youre a really big fan ofwell, boring weapons. In every respect, this game is merely serviceable, without doing anything good (or bad) enough to merit strong feelings one way or another.There are a few minor annoyances, mind you. The on-screen text is pretty small, which means that its easy to lose track of how much health you have left at any given time. The objectives may be straightforward, but theyre also (say it with me) highly repetitive, as each level asks you to do more or less the same thing. And on a related note, the game only unlocks new levels once you reach a certain number of stars (which are obtained via achieving objectives), which means that youll probably have to do those early levels over and over again if you want to achieve much in the way of progress.", "date": "October 11, 2016", "grade": "C+"}
