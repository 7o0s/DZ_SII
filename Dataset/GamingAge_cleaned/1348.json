{"name": "Steins;Gate", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/steinsgate-review-for-ps-vita-ps3/", "text": "Does a game need to have likeable characters in order to be enjoyable?Thats actually not a rhetorical question, by the way  or at least not entirely. I ask it because your answer will most likely determine how much you enjoy Steins;Gate.This is because  and theres no way to put it nicely  the games main character is a colossal douchebag. Obnoxious, rude, delusional, angry, possibly homophobic, definitely transphobicbasically, just think of the most thoroughly misanthropic person imaginable, and you have some idea of what Rintaro Okabe (or Okarin, or Kyoma Hooin, or whatever name hes going by) is like. Considering that Rintaro is also the narrator, committing to Steins;Gate also means committing to spending every second of the game with a profoundly unlikeable person. Sure, the supporting cast isnt nearly as bad, but that hardly matters when youre stuck without someone so detestable the whole time. In other words, if you answered a resounding Yes to this reviews first sentence, chances are good youre not going to find Steins;Gate to be particularly fun.If, however, youre able to overlook obnoxious characters in favour of most other aspects of the game being worthwhile, then youll most likely have the opposite reaction. This is because  and I say this as someone who probably leans more towards the opposing viewpoint  Steins;Gate does a lot of stuff very well. Most obviously: it actually tries to tell a story. Youd think this would be the baseline thing for any visual novel, but having played both Xblaze games I know thats not always the case. Some visual novels take narrative shortcuts, and expect that your knowledge of the source material and broader universe will fill in the gaps. Steins;Gate doesnt do that; you dont need to know the games anime backstory to follow along (which is a good thing, because this is my first exposure to the franchise). Instead, it lays out the characters and the setting, and allows everything to just happen in front of you. Its kind of crazy that a game so reliant on narrative could be praised for this, but there you go.Likewise, it doesnt treat the players like theyre idiots. I mean, it kind of does, but only because Rintaro treats everyone like theyre idiots. Taking a step back and looking at it from a broader perspective, though, its plain that Steins;Gate has no problem giving players lots and lots of dense information, and trusting that theyll be able to remember it, follow along, and see how Point A leads to Point B. Its kind of refreshing to see a game that places so much trust in its readers/players  and its all the more impressive that this game in particular does that, considering how heavy it goes into hard sci-fi territory. This all goes back to that previous point, though: Steins;Gate is able to tell a complex story because it actually tries to tell the whole story, rather than just skipping along from plot point to plot point and hoping players know enough backstory theyll be able to make sense of it in their heads.As you can imagine, all of this takes some time. Even though Steins;Gate has some interactive components that allow you to impact the storys outcome, its important to know that its possible to go for hours at a stretch here and never have the opportunity to do anything more than press X to advance the text. Obviously, you shouldnt go into any visual novel without the expectation therell be reading involved, but that seems to go double here.", "date": "August 27, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
