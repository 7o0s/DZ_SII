If you already know, you can skip the rest of this paragraph. And if you dont, Ill point you in the direction of this handy WIkipedia article so you can fill in the gaps of your knowledge.Are we all on the same page now? Good, because that means I can say this: I havent read any fan fiction, but London Detective Mysteria is basically exactly what I imagine the genre to be, right down to the Mary Sue main character. You start off being told how beautiful and intelligent the main character is as shes on her way to meet Queen Victoria, when you arrive you encounter Sherlock Holmes and Watson  sorry, their children, Herlock Holmes and, er, Watson (but William, not John)  and, as a mystery immediately presents itself, they insist that you have to help them because youre so obviously smart, not to mention beautiful. From there, its not long until you encounter a bunch of other offspring of famous people both real (Jack the Rippers son wants to woo you!) and fictional (like the son of Lupin the Thief and the niece of Agatha Christies Miss Marple  the latter despite the fact that the game takes place about 30 years before Marple herself shows up in Christies bibliography).Despite the overwhelmingly fanfic-y nature of the whole thing, its hard to complain about it too much, for a couple of reasons.First, London Detective Mysteria is an otome visual novel. When the entire genre is built around a group of guys trying to woo a young female main character, its inevitable that she ends up coming off as a little idealized. It obviously stands out much more when you have historical figures and well-established fictional characters  or, at least, their remarkably similar relatives  raving about the main characters beauty and their intelligence, but given that the same is true of virtually every other game in the genre, Im willing to give it a pass.Secondly, and more importantly, London Detective Mysteria may be fan fiction, but at least its enjoyable. Ive played enough otome games to know that more than a few of them stagger under the weight of their own ponderousness, and thats not the case here. This game never forgets that its trying to be a mystery novel, so it keeps things moving along relatively briskly while also doling out its mysteries bit by bit  just enough to keep you invested in whats going on, and interested in trying to solve whats going on.I mean, its not great literature or anything, so dont go in expecting that. London Detective Mysteria is silly fan fiction where Sherlock Holmes and Queen Victoria and Miss Marple and Jack the Ripper (or at least their proxies) all interact and no one bats an eye. But sometimes, you dont need to bat an eye, and you just need to go with it. If youre a fan at all of visual novels, this is definitely one of the times to just go with it.", "date": "March 25, 2019", "grade": "B"}
