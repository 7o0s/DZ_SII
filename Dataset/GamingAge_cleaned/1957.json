There would be no cause for betrayal, no feelings of jealousy or rage that would creep into a lifelong friendship. Unfortunately we all know life doesnt work that way. But few of us would take it to the extreme that Paul Bitterman does in Charlie Murder. Making an unholy pact for supernatural powers, conscripting a band composed of demonic forces, and bringing about the end of the world is a pretty knee-jerk reaction for being ditched by your best friend in favor of his increasingly popular band.But that premise sets the stage for the second entry in 2013s Summer of Arcade promotion for Xbox Live Arcade. Charlie Murder is a 2D beat em up in the vein of other modern brawlers like Castle Crashers, but with a slightly darker take on bashing dudes in the face. There are five characters to choose from at the start, a sprawling overworld map with interconnected stages, RPG mechanics including distributable stats and gear, and a whole lot of head stomping fun in this digital release from Ska Studios.While the basic elements of combat arent particularly evolved past the heyday of the genre, Charlie Murder does have a lot of unique elements in place. The gear/loot system is culled from real world items, grounding the reality of the game despite all the otherworldly shenanigans going on. Loot can be comprised of jackets, hats, hand wraps, glasses, masks, gloves and more. Theres even an effort made to distribute stat bonuses on loot that make sense, like boosting Anar-chi (magic) by wearing clothing for your head, while boosting strength with items worn on your hands.Other aspects like stat distribution, or tracking your progress to the next level, are focused on taking the player out of the game as little as possible. A lot of menu functions are tied into your in-game smartphone which gives you access to email that conveys story elements along with minor tutorials. You can also access a Twitter like app that displays followers and messages from fans, with the number of followers equating to experience points earned.The five characters available are also built around familiar class archetypes, such as Tank, Shaman, Berserker and more. If youve played any sort of class focused RPG before, youll have little trouble figuring out the appropriate role of each character. Every character also has a number of unique skills to unlock, along with core abilities available for each class. The customization options arent super deep here, there are no branching skill trees to unlock, but youll always have more skills available than you can purchase, which at least forces you to tailor your selections around the way youd like to play.The only real interface issue I had with Charlie Murder came from single use items, consumables that not only heal but boost the four core stats for every character. There are a number of found items to heal your character with, along with beer that can be crafting, and other food that can be bought. When in combat youre limited to using food thats hot keyed to a button press, but have no real way of cycling between available consumables. Outside of combat this isnt an issue because you can just bring up a menu and eat what you want, but while fighting this isnt an option. It feels more like an oversight than anything else, but its the one thing that become increasingly annoying the further into Charlie Murder I got.Charlie Murders other mechanics are a bit more derivative of the beat em ups that have come before it, but are at least really well executed. There are a hefty number of stages to run through, all of which connect to one another in a way that youll never need to view the overworld map outside of the initial start-up of the game. You can, however, back out to the overworld map at various points, allowing you to replay stages or seek out a number of secrets.Combat is combo based with basic attack strings performed by light and strong attack commands. The five characters vary a bit here, but the move set isnt diverse. I did like the inclusion of Ryu Hayabusas patented Izuna Drop from Ninja Gaiden, which is one of many smartly placed video game references contained in Charlie Murder. And while basic punch and kick attacks arent amazing, the comically extreme violence that comes after beating a foe to death does add a little macabre charm to what could otherwise be mindlessly repetitive. Theres a lot of focus on found weapons in combat, some of which are body parts from felled foes, which is another element that helps make Charlie Murder stand out.Finally, while I wasnt expecting much from story side of Charlie Murder, I found myself pleasantly surprised by its execution once the end game credits rolled. Theres very little story forced upon the player, with only a handful of cutscenes throughout that are mostly voiced in gibberish and sold almost entirely through animation and music. But I had a fair amount of empathy for the villain of the game despite his extreme response to feeling betrayed. It was also intriguing to think that the lead protagonist wasnt entirely without fault, and the final moments of Charlie Murder lead to an enhanced perspective on everything youve just accomplished, taking that general feeling of jubilation received when completing a game and transforming it into something a little less exuberant.", "date": "August 23, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
