{"name": "Stitchy in Tooki Trouble", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/05/stitchy-in-tooki-trouble-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "The problem with Stitchy in Tooki Trouble isnt that its a bad game. Its not  its mostly pretty competently made (with one or two flaws that Ill get to in a few paragraphs), it looks nice, and it runs smoothly. Objectively, its fine.Rather, Stitchy in Tooki Troubles problem is that its wholly unoriginal. Its basically a clone of Donkey Kong Country. Just about the only two differences are that a) its not nearly as challenging, and b) it stars a scarecrow instead of an ape. Otherwise, you could sub DK in for Stitchy, this games eponymous hero, and no one would bat an eye.To be fair, thats not nothing. If youre going to create a 2D platformer and you dont have any original ideas, you could do a lot worse than to steal directly from one of the most venerable and enduring franchises the genre has to offer. Ive played plenty of clones and rip-offs that dont come anywhere close to being as good in their cloning/rip-off-ery as what Stitchy in Tooki Trouble achieves here.Whats more, if you can overlook the lack of original ideas, Stitchy in Tooki Trouble is pretty good at what it does. The levels are nicely varied, and you seldom feel like youre just playing the same thing over and over again. Theyre fairly short, mind you, and the platforming isnt super-precise  and the latter especially goes for this games minecart levels, which were consistently the one part of each world that made me want to quit the game and never come back to it.And, of course, theres the games biggest issue, which is that Donkey Kong Country already exists. Taken on its own terms, Stitchy in Tooki Trouble is perfectly fine, but when you factor in that you could just play the game(s) that have influenced everything about it, its hard to wonder why youd play this over the original.", "date": "May 4, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
