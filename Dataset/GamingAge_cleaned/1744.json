{"name": "That Trivia Game", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/04/trivia-game-review-ps4/", "text": "Once in awhile a game show videogame comes out of nowhere to surprise the masses and raises the bar of what gamers can expect from the genre. That Trivia Gameis not that game. That Trivia Game is as generic as its name and barely worth the words Im giving it time for. With no trial version, gamers who plunk down the $9.99 for this waste of storage space will be more than disappointed. I had to wonder that the reviews that were posted at the day the game launched werent by the developers themselves as no one in their right mind would give this game a good review, no matter how much of a trivia nut you are.The visuals are horrible, with nearly PS One era graphics for the player models, uninspired backdrops, and avatar character choices which include a punk rocker, goth girl, nerd, and even a pirate. None of these fit the game and are more suited for Lets Make a Deal. The game audio is just as generic with lame background music, and uninspired voice acting for the host which repeats quite often. There is an assorted mixture of trivia questions that cover categories such as TV, Movies, History, Geography, and others. The only problem is that with only slightly over 1,000 questions, the repetition starts fairly quickly, and so does the horror as players realize there isnt an option for DLC or added content whatsoever. As a matter of fact there isnt any online support at all, including leaderboards, online play  absolutely nothing. All you receive for your 10 bucks is 1,000 questions on an engine with dated visuals, boring sounds, and uninspired game play that you can share with (or torture) up to 3 other players on your PS4and thats about it.", "date": "April 26, 2014", "grade": "F"}
