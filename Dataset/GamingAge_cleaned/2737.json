Do you want to spend even more time with those characters? Then you should pick it up.Thats literally the only reason to play Yumeutsutsu Re:After, though. Its a series of bonus stories that pick up where Re:Master left off, and theres zero explanation or backstory given, so if youre not fully up on the story, youre going to be completely lost.Now, Ill be honest: even though I played Re:Master just over a month ago, I have zero recollection of any of it, beyond the fact I found it painfully dull. So the prospect of spending even more time  even just a few hours  with Ai, Kokoro and the rest of the cast didnt exactly fill me with a lot of hope.I mean, I tried. I played through some of the endings. But at no time did I feel remotely interested or engaged in what was going on. Its lots of the meandering dialogue and half-baked double entendres that made up the first game, only stretched out for a few more hours. Thats not a slight against anyone who did enjoy Yumeutsutsu Re:After. Im sure that if you made it through that first game and desperately wanted more, then this is probably a dream come true. But as I said up top, unless that describes you with eerie accuracy, then youre better of skipping this one, too.", "date": "February 15, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
