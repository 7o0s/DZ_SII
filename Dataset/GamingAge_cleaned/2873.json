{"name": "One Line Coloring", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/09/one-line-coloring-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "The concept behind One Line Coloring is pretty basic: its essentially connect-the-dots, only you can never lift your finger, and at the end of it you have a neat-looking picture. Youtube is full of tutorials on how to do them, if youre interested.Despite the simplicity, there are a couple of great things about One Line Coloring. First, it feels like the medium is perfectly-suited to the Switch between the touch controls and the fact you can simply reset the puzzle if you screw up. I cant imagine the frustration youd feel trying to do some of these pictures with pen/pencil and paper.Secondly, its hard to imagine a more zen-inducing game. I started playing it late one evening while watching the news, and any tension I had melted away pretty quickly. I came back to it a few days later, and found myself zipping through puzzle after puzzle, and being completely immersed in it the whole time.This, however, is also One Line Colorings big drawback: its very short. There are more than 100 puzzles included, but once you get the hang of the concept  which itself doesnt take too long  youll be able to finish each of them in well under a minute. Add it all up, and youre almost certainly going to have experienced everything this game has to offer in less than two hours.", "date": "September 18, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
