{"name": "Talisman: Digital Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/05/talisman-digital-edition-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "First things first: Ive never played Talisman before, so I have no idea how accurately Talisman: Digital Edition captures the nuance of the boardgame. The full extent of my knowledge of the analog edition of the game is what can be found on Wikipedia, and even then, if there were some kind of pop quiz, Id be screwed.In other words, if youre reading this and hoping for me to tell you how accurately the game translates over to the Vita: apologies right now, because youll be sorely disappointed.However, my lack of familiarity with the game also means I can state, unequivocally, that Talisman: Digital Edition does a very good job of making newcomers feelnot necessarily at ease, since it took me hours to figure out what was going on, but at least welcome. Even if I dont know the boardgame, based on whats expected of players here (and, obviously, what Wikipedia tells me), I get the sense that its somewhat complex. Here, by contrast, the game does just enough handholding that you dont need the kind of in-depth knowledge the real-life version demands. It explains things, and, if thats not enough for you, it autopilots you through some of the tougher moments. If left to my own devices, Im not sure Id be able to figure out a significant chunk of what I have to do here, but with a little help, I can get by.That said, because the game is so quick to take steps for you, it becomes very easy for the whole thing to become monotonous. Heck, even without the games help, it becomes very easy for Talisman: Digital Edition to grow monotonous, for the simple reason that with six players and no speed up function, you spend a couple of seconds every few minutes rolling the dice and seeing what happens, and the rest of the time watching AI players battle their way around the board. It doesnt exactly make for the most compelling gameplay.", "date": "May 31, 2017", "grade": "B"}
