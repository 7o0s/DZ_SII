{"name": "Dont Die, Mr. Robot", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/11/dont-die-mr-robot-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Dont Die, Mr. Robot  or, as it was called until its developers became skittish about potential lawsuits, Avoid Droid  seems like the sort of game that couldve been released at virtually any time in the history of video games. It may be a Vita game now, but Im pretty sure that it couldve been released on a mobile device, PS360, or NES, and no one wouldve batted an eye. Obviously, depending on the system thered probably be some graphical upgrades or downgrades, but all in all, that tells you something about the timelessness of Dont Die, Mr. Robots gameplay.Whether that something is good or bad, of course, is open to a little debate. For the most part, Id say its good. Dont Die, Mr. Robot (which Ill just call DDMR from here on out in the interests of space) is built around one simple mechanic: as its former title implied, helping the titular droid (er, Robot) avoid enemies. Thats pretty much the extent of the whole game. There are wrinkles here and there  some levels ask you to last as long as you can, others call for X number of kills in X time, still others are score-based, and so on  but in general, what youre doing on the first level of the game is pretty similar to what youre doing hours and hours later.Which is where the bad  or, at least, the sort of bad  comes in. DDMR is definitely a little repetitive. If you dont enjoy the act of avoiding enemies and snatching up explosive fruits at first, its not like the game introduces some crazy new mechanics later on that will make you rethink everything you know about DDMR. What you see at first is, more or less, what you get.To which I say: thats a big part of the appeal. DDMR is the sort of game you can pick up for a couple of minutes at a time. Youre guaranteed to instantly remember exactly what youre supposed to do (its practically in the title!), and you can chase high scores between classes or bus stops without worrying about having to remember a bunch of stuff.", "date": "November 17, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
