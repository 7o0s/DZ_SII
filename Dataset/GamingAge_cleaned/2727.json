{"name": "Gibbous  A Cthulhu Adventure", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/02/gibbous-a-cthulhu-adventure-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Back in the fall, I reviewed a game called Tangle Tower. I was a big fan of it, in part because even though it was an adventure game, it wasnt slavishly devoted to the 90s. Ive played my fair share of modern takes on the genre, and for the most part they seem to begin and end with trying to recreate Day of the Tentacle and Maniac Mansion. Thats not the worst idea  those games are classic for a reason  but it does make it feel like the genre now exists primarily to relive past glories.Gibbous  A Cthulhu Adventure is, unfortunately, not like Tangle Tower  which is to say that its more or less what youd expect from an adventure game. It has all the hallmarks of the genre  the snarky tone, the click on almost literally everything gameplay, the puzzles where you combine random item X with random item Y to solve  without really adding anything of its own.That said, even if Gibbous doesnt bring anything new to the table, its not wholly without charms. For one thing, the writing isnt bad, and the bonkers story about a talking cat, a doomsday cults, and the possible end of the world moves along at a decent pace. Plus, notwithstanding the Lovecraft reference in the name, the game doesnt have the usual self-seriousness that tends to pervade games that draw from the horror writer. Its horror-adjacent comedy, rather than horror.Even more importantly, Gibbous looks absolutely stunning, like a cartoon that you can interact with. The cutscenes look fantastic, and even if the playable environments arent quite as outstanding, they still look better than the vast majority of other games  adventure genre or not.Of course, the game doesnt look so incredible that its able to overcome being your standard adventure game fare  perhaps because, looks side, Gibbous is your standard adventure game fare. Thats great news if youre a genre fan looking for another hit, but if youre not already a fan, nothing here is likely to make you one.", "date": "February 25, 2021", "grade": "B"}
