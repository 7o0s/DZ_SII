{"name": "Xbox One X", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/11/xbox-one-x-review/", "text": "The Xbox One X is a beast of a videogame console, theres no doubt about it. Microsoft went back to the drawing board and equipped the super-powered Xbox One X with what they codenamed the Scorpio Engine which boils down to 6 teraflops of graphical processing power, 12GB GDDR5 Memory, and 326GB/s of memory bandwidth according to the product literature. At heart, the X is still an Xbox One of course and will continue to play all Xbox One games (backwards compatible titles too) and utilize all Xbox One accessories. The console is just a member of the family thats significantly more capable than the original Xbox One we first met a few years ago. Gamers who want/need the most powerful piece of console hardware in their entertainment center, without a doubt, its the Xbox One X. Is the upgrade worth it for existing Xbox gamers or those who have yet to jump into the Xbox One family? Yes! Though that answer is still highly dependant on a players preference for software and online ecosystem.Let me give a little background regarding my gaming habits over the past generation so you can see where Im coming from in my coverage here. First of all, I have zero interest in stepping back into the realm of PC gaming. I dont have the patience nor the funds to keep up with the myriad of powerful/pricey PC hardware upgrades these days  no matter the potential for amazing visual performance that can be squeezed out of a custom rig. Secondly, full disclosure, Im more of a PlayStation 4 gamer than an Xbox One gamer these days, which mostly has to do with the game library, more active friends list and (up until now) somewhat better multiplatform game performance  in that order. I have indeed upgraded to the realm of 4K HDR gaming with a gorgeous Samsung KS8000 UHD set and a PS4 Pro over the past year and do not regret the decision at all. So in terms of 4K gaming on a console, I have some experience now.Oh and just to get it out of the way. The Xbox One X console and Xbox One X enhanced games were supplied by Microsoft for evaluation purposes. See our unboxing article/gallery, here.The Xbox One X has to be Microsofts most well-engineered piece of console hardware yet. Theyve stumbled in the past, with some odd design choices and some faulty hardware, and I think theyve finally found their way for sure. The Xbox One X console is unexpectedly small at 11.81 x 9.45 x 2.36 and surprisingly weighty at around 8.5 lbs (around 2 lbs more than the Xbox One X S). Some of this weight, were assuming, is due to the more advanced liquid cooling system and centrifugal fan in the tightly packed form factor. Well, so far, that cooling setup seems to be working since the thing is generally whisper quiet  at least based on the somewhat limited supply of Xbox One X enhanced games that are available at the moment. At worst, I felt some warm air and hot spots on the top of the case here and there after an extended play session with many GBs of downloads happening in the background. And this is with the X stacked on top of another component in a somewhat airflow restricted cabinet. So thumbs up so far!As for the consoles design, the Xbox One X is a clean, nice looking system  dont get me wrong, but Its probably a little more function over form in terms of overall aesthetics. Its a solid matte black rectangle with some strategically placed cooling holes and the familiar light up Xbox logo power button; and to be honest at first glance, no one is going to know its an Xbox One X. Its lacking sex appeal, though its far from ugly. Considering that its just another component in a cabinet in my personal home entertainment center, thats fine by me. Its definitely beautiful on the inside so thats all that counts.Microsoft is marketing the Xbox One X as a premium product, and one which costs nearly two times the going rate for ahalfway decentgood Xbox One S deal or bundle, so I maybe had some odd expectations on the packaging and presentation for some reason. The box is a little flimsy and I would have appreciated maybe a packed in headset like the good old Xbox 360 days, so the very first impression you get of the console doesnt scream premium to me. Its not something to lose sleep over, though it was worth commenting on at the very least. Also, that 1TB HDD isnt going to last all that long, since some XB1X enhanced games are already topping 100GB.In terms of dashboard performance and load times, I havent noticed a measurable difference thus far. Im still not super, super fond of the new Xbox One interface although its functional and customizable enough. The dashboard is not silky smooth and occasionally suffers from some of the usual quirks and hitches which we assume has more to do with fetching and rendering Xbox Live online data than a lack of processing power. As for upgraded features on a system level, the ability to record gameplay clips in4K resolution at 60 frames per second is a great enhancement for those who produce videos or livestream. Im still of the mind that Microsoft should have held back their 4K video streaming and Ultra HD 4K Blu-ray capabilities for the Xbox One X since it would have been a bigger differentiator over the Xbox One S, although that ship has obviously sailed. 4K HDR video seems to be identical to what the Xbox One S can output, via apps or the Ultra HD Blu-ray drive itself. We had the opportunity to check out the gorgeous Planet Earth II on Ultra HD Blu-ray, and damn, is that some damn fine looking 4K nature footage.So Microsoft is all 4K this and 4K that as a major selling point for the Xbox One X. As a number of developers have displayed to us already on the PC and PS4 Pro, gaming on a 4K-capable game platform isnt just about the raw pixel count however. Games running at 4K (rendered natively or via other techniques) look clean and sharp, especially when the proper anti-aliasing solution is being utilized, but theres more to the Xbox One X than that. Gears of War 4 being a great example.With Xbox One X enhanced games and game updates popping up nearly every day (keep an eye on the official list, here), we only had the opportunity to get our hands on a few other enhanced titles which are noted below. Many games will not see their updates roll out until next week, on or around November 7th, so keep an eye on the list.The Xbox One X enhanced Gears of War 4 packs in many more gigabytes of super high quality textures, improved draw distances, geometry improvements, better shadows and lighting, the option to favor visuals or performance and the ability to render the game natively at 4K resolution (depending on the option) with HDR. Gears 4 on the Xbox One X very well may be, at times, the best looking console game out there thus far. If it were just capable of rendering at 4K, I probably wouldnt make that statement, but in conjunction with all of the other enhancements I definitely can and will. Of course this opinion kinda depends on what you think of the Gears artstyle of course, but thats another conversation. My personal preference in Gears 4, for campaign at least, has been the Visuals Rendering Performance option, which locks the title at 30fps but offer enhanced effects and 4K resolution. Performance looks ridiculous too since it seems to hold a pretty stead 60fps, although with less demanding effects and whatnot. Decisions, decisions. Those only with access to a 1080p display will get all of those other improvements as well, including even better image quality (as compared to a game rendering at or less than 1080p) thanks to supersampled downscaling of the 4K signal. As a side note, with the Gears of War 4 file size clocking in at over 103GB (?!) after the latest patch, that 1TB drive doesnt seem all that huge anymore!Killer Instinct is starting to show its age, although its never looked better. Rendering at a native 4K at 60fps (but with no HDR unfortunately), the game is still quite a looker. Its worth it to just check out the stunning particles and special effects thats for sure. The pre-rendered cutscenes look pretty subpar at this point since the real-time scenes are decidedly more detailed.We have a full review forthcoming, so this is more about the Xbox One X visual enhancements more than anything. On the Xbox One X, Super Luckys Tale is crisp, super clean and smooth (with some minor framerate hitches every once in a while), rendering at 4K and 60fps. It started out as a Oculus Rift title so its not incredibly detailed, though those looking for a 3D platforming fix or a colorful, family friendly title to show off your new 4K hardware probably cant go wrong. Gameplay wise, its not up to Super Mario Odyssey quality, nor did we expect it to be.Rush: A Disney-Pixar Adventure and Disneyland Adventures are both remasters of previously released Kinect-only Xbox 360 titles and they look.. well.. like higher resolution remasters of Xbox 360 games. They are apparently being rendered at 4K with HDR, and at times look very close to the various movies and scenes in which they are based on, but the framerates leave a little to be desired. Like Super Luckys Tale, they are clean and jaggy free at 4K and the HDR helps polish up the overall look a bit. Both are cute for kids and Disney fans and theres now the option to use a controller along with Kinect motion controls. Theres a number of local and online co-op gaming possibilities, so we like that too. Both titles support Dolby Atmos audio if you happen to have a capable system.Like the DIsney titles, Zoo Tycoon is also a remastered Xbox 360 game so its a little bit difficult to compare the original to the Xbox One version to the enhanced Xbox One X version. Either way, for a tycoon-style game, it shows off pretty solid visuals. It still tops out at around 30fps, although rendered at 4K with HDR, which certainly makes it the best looking version of the game so far. Its super addictive to play and some of the animals and their texturing and fur rendering are quite good. In the end, Zoo Tycoon still looks like an extra clean, remastered previous generation title even with the Xbox One X enhancements. The game suffers from some extremely long load times for some reason.Quantum Break was a great looking Xbox One title and its an even better looking Xbox One X title. Apparently, along with the 4K output (were not sure if its native or not), it received a very hefty 4K texture upgrade which looks absolutely fantastic. We need to spend more time with this to be honest since it was just patched within the last day. The total file size is now over 83GB without downloading the offline episodes (about another 75GB)We havent had time to delve into Halo 5 since the patch was released late last night, although we are excited to! We do know that it will feature visuals up to 4K resolution support but no HDR. It was already a great looking release so the Xbox One X enhancements should be icing on the cake.Halo Wars 2 is the same deal as Halo 5, although Halo Wars 2/Halo Wars 2: Awakening the Nightmare is enhanced with Ultra HD 4K and HDR support too. Well be back with impressions of that in the near future as well since the update was also just pushed out.As of this review, there are still several titles which do not officially have their enhanced updates available to download quite yet. That includes Halo 3, ReCore Definitive Edition, Forza Motorsport 7, Assassins Creed Origins, Gears of War 4, and Rise of the Tomb Raider, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, Minecraft, EA Sports titles and others. Well be all over those once they are available, including future releases which will also include Xbox One X enhanced visuals and performance as well. Once again, keep an eye on that list!So, to wrap things up here somewhat (so we can get back to evaluating the enhanced games of course), the Xbox One X is definitely a premium Xbox One product at a relatively reasonable price, especially as compared to similarly powered PC upgrades. There are still a lot of variables to consider before plunking down for any new console so the same school of thought applies here: Do you require the best console version of a multiplatform games? Are most of your friends on Xbox Live? Are the first party and exclusive Xbox One games in the pipeline enticing enough? Do you want the latest and greatest piece of Xbox hardware to show off your fancy 4K HDR-enabled display (and/or are too impatient to wait until the next console generation)? If youve answered yes to most of these, then the Xbox One X it is!", "date": "November 3, 2017", "grade": null}
