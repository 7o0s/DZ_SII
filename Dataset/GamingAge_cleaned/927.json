{"name": "Darkest Dungeon", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/01/darkest-dungeon-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Ill say this for Darkest Dungeon: the things it does well, it does very, very well.Take the voice acting, for instance. Darkest Dungeon is all about its moody, miserable atmosphere. To that end, developers Red Hook Studios went out and got a narrator, Wayne June, who  per Wikipedia  is best known for lending his talents to H.P. Lovecraft horror stories. With that kind of background, it should come as no surprise that he brings an appropriately creepy, menacing vibe to the proceedings here. Every description of the players collective terror, of the encroaching dark, of the blow-by-blow in every battle: its all given a kind of horrifying gravitas thats guaranteed to draw you in.On top of that, the games entire aesthetic is pretty creepy. Between the quick speed at which torches burn out while you crawl through dungeons and the traps and gothic horrors that await your every step, its easy to feel a constant sense of unease throughout your time with Darkest Dungeon.As for the restI wouldnt say that Darkest Dungeon does anything really badly, necessarily. Its more that it does things in a way that makes it a hard game to truly love. Admittedly, some of this is by design: you dont include permadeaths and frequent autosave points in your game unless youre trying to make things as difficult as possible, so Im not going to criticize this game for that.I will, however, say that it would be nice if it explained just a few things a little more clearly and/or obviously. Things like how to use your items outside of battle. Or how to get characters out of churches and bars once theyve been put into them. Or, most importantly of all, how to switch characters in and out of your party. These are all things that youre likely to figure out sooner or later on your own, but it would be nice if there were some easier way to pick it up than trial and error.", "date": "January 3, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
