{"name": "Road Redemption", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/12/road-redemption-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Somewhere deep in my brain, I have fond memories of the original Road Rash series. I wasnt much into gaming in the late 90s, nor have I ever been very into PC gaming, but for a couple of glorious months around 1997 or so, for whatever reason, a friend got me completely hooked on the games PC release.I mention this because I suspect 1997 me would have been blown away by Road Redemption. Compared to the standards of those days, it looks and plays incredible, with relatively great graphics and all kinds of fun ways of taking out your fellow racers. It would have felt like Road Rash, but a million times better in every conceivable way.1997 me, of course, didnt exactly have the highest standards.Whats more, Road Redemption should be judged against its modern-day competition, not against its spiritual predecessors. And in a post-Burnout, post-Danger Zone, post-Carmageddon worldwell, it doesnt look quite as great.In fact, Road Redemption looks and plays like something that wouldve come out 15 years ago, and that probably would have been considered a little buggy and half-finished even then. Racers seem to pop in and out of existence, as does scenery. Its not uncommon to crash your bike, and then find yourself tumbling through the underside of the world.And the controlsmy goodness, the controls. There is a button for turning abruptly, but it doesnt make a huge difference. If you ever find yourself going offroad and in need of an instant course correction, youll find it feels more like turning a battleship than a motorcycle. Likewise, as the rider, trying to hit your fellow racers will often feel more like a matter of luck than of skill  and, honestly, most of the time youd be better off just steering into opponents and driving them off bridges or into other cars.Given how long its been since I played the game from which this draws such a heavy influence, its quite possible that this was how the original Road Rash games played as well. But even if it wasnt, Road Redemption is such a reasonable facsimile that it makes me feel like its a possibility, which seems like an achievement in and of itself. That doesnt make it a great game (or even a very good one, or even one you should consider buying unless you have a desperate need to relive the 90s), but it does make Road Redemption a perfect successor to the games its trying to emulate.", "date": "December 19, 2018", "grade": "C+"}
