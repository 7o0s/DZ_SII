All the usual stuff is here: JRPG tropes galore, lots of referential video game humour, and seemingly endless amounts of expository infodumps doubling as plot progression. If none of the previous games have won you over, theres nothing here that will make you re-evaluate your opinion.In fact, this is probably more true for Megadimension Neptunia VII than it has been of any of the previous games: theres just so much more of Hyperdimension Neptunia here than there ever has been. Just take a gander at the games Wikipedia plot summary: thats over 6,000 words. Megadimension Neptunia VII brings together three separate stories, which basically means youre getting three times as much Hyperdimension Neptunia as youd normally get.Thats a lot of Hyperdimension Neptunia. And, to be frank, its a lot more than I can take. Im fond of the series when it breaks out of its mold and tries new things (which is why Im really looking forward to next months MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies). Megadimension Neptunia VII doesnt do that. Megadimension Neptunia VII throws lots and lots of exposition at you, intermittently breaks it up with a few rounds of turn-based battles, and  eventually  calls it a day.", "date": "March 18, 2016", "grade": "B"}
