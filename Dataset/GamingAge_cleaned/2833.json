Sure, the Switch is no PS4 or Xbox One, but for the most part, XCOM 2 still looks very nice on Nintendos hybrid system. While the last time XCOM came to a handheld it came with a pretty noticeable visual downgrade, the XCOM 2 Collection doesnt suffer in any significant way. I mean, its not like the game is super graphically intensive or anything, but still: it looks as good as it needs to here.Rather, I mean that Im struck by how well XCOM 2 translates over to the Switch, much like I was impressed at how the first XCOM worked on the Vita. Obviously, given the series stature when it comes to tactical RPGs, it should come as no surprise that the gameplay here is exceptional, but I still think that theres something about it that works especially well on a handheld, where you can drop in and out of games at any time. While none of the missions are particularly lengthy, I still enjoy playing them on a Switch much more than I ever have on a proper console.If the XCOM 2 Collection falls down anywhere, its in the games performance. Theres nothing game-breaking here, but there are certainly issues that detract from the overall experience. Theres a little stuttering here and there, and occasionally you have to deal with long load times. Perhaps the biggest annoyance, though, was that occasionally the camera would just start wandering all over the battlefield. I dont know if this is just a case of my Switch finally experiencing the dreaded drifting or what, but it was certainly an unwelcome wrinkle. Mind you, given were talking about turn-based combat, its not as if I was killed on the battlefield because of it  it just occasionally happened, and eventually it would snap back to where it was supposed to be.On the whole, though, the XCOM 2 Collection is a pretty welcome addition to the Switch library. Its got a great reputation for a reason as being a key part of arguably the best tactical RPG series out there, and that reputation survives the games jump over to the Switch almost entirely intact.", "date": "November 2, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
