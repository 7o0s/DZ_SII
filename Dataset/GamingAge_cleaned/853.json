After all, its arguably the first year since the franchises resurrection that it isnt a complete and utter dumpster fire of a game, and it has the misfortune of coming out at the same year as MLB The Show 17 decided to include a retro mode that puts everything R.B.I. Baseball does to shame. When I wrote a few weeks ago that The Shows retro mode seemed like a deliberate slight against R.B.I. Baseball, I did so without having played the latter game. Now that I havewell, the net effect from last year to this year is kind of like watching a bully beat up a proverbial 98-pound weakling, the weakling responding by bulking up and learning how to fight a little, and then, when the weakling shows up for a rematch, he discovers that the bully has developed mutant superpowers in the meantime.The problem with that metaphor  apart from it being wildly, needlessly complex  is that it implies that R.B.I. Baseball 2017 gets anywhere close to being as good as MLB The Show 17. This is not the case in any way. It still, on the whole, sucks. The problems that existed before still mostly exist now. The ball moves in bizarre, unpredictable ways. The camera is a nightmare of random angles. The differences between the players is negligible at best. Fielding is still a constant adventure, while errors are simply constant, even with AI assistance on. The game is still extremely limited in its functionality: you can play exhibition games, seasons, or playoffs, and theres very little depth to any of them.On top of that, the new year brings new problems. Baserunner AI is mind-bogglingly stupid, with runners prone to staying rooted on their bases even after batters have driven base hits into the gap. In a similar vein, runners are generally pretty slow, to the point that any time you go for an extra base, youre essentially rolling the dice. And to round things out, the controls  which never seemed all that complex before  look shoddy in comparison to MLB The Shows one-button gameplay.And yet, despite all the games many, many flaws, theres no denying that it has improved. First and foremost, pitchers suddenly have stamina. No longer will you be forced to go to the bullpen after three or four innings regardless of how well your starter is doing; complete games are actually possible, unlike in R.B.I. Baseball 16. In a similar vein (that is, from the perspective that R.B.I. Baseball 2017 bears a closer resemblance to the sport its trying to portray), while the ball may move in unpredictable ways, at the very least it no longer goes flying off the bat on every swing. Slugfests, while possible, have ceased to be the default, particularly when you play the game on easier difficulty levels.Beyond that, the game has also made a few minor aesthetic improvements. Like last year, players continue to move in ways that vaguely approximate actual human movement, and theyre able to do so independently of each other. On top of that, the graphics are noticeably better; the players may all be interchangeable, but the fields on which theyre playing look pretty nice.", "date": "April 25, 2017", "grade": "C-"}
