{"name": "Radio Squid", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/07/radio-squid-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Radio Squid is the third game Ive played from Pixelteriyaki, and in some ways its very much like the previous two. Much like Super Weekend Mode and Mochi Mochi Boy before it, Radio Squid feels like a Japanese fever dream, with all kinds of flashing visuals and weirdness flying across the screen.In this case, youre controlling the titular squid, whosuhtruthfully, I didnt follow the brief story at the beginning. Its something about ridding the ocean of a curse, which you do by going from undersea room to undersea room, firing little pellets at various undersea enemies. It doesnt make a whole lot of sense, but, much like its Pixelteriyaki predecessors, I dont think its meant to.The key difference between Radio Squid and those other two games, however, is that Radio Squid isnt all that fun. The pellets youre firing have an annoyingly long lifespan, and theyre prone to bouncing off walls and hitting you. This is especially annoying when you factor in that you dont have much control over when you fire the pellets  the shoot out in time with the music, and they tend to ricochet back and hit you constantly. The good news is that you can continue from where you die as long as you have enough coins, and this game is very generous with the amount of coins enemies drop, but its not enough to make up for a mechanic that gets pretty repetitive very early on.If Radio Squid does have a saving grace  apart from the weirdness, which always counts as a plus in my books  its the music. This whole game is soundtracked by glitchy-sounding electronic music, and I love it. In fact, I would much rather spend the hour or so it takes to get this games Platinum listening to it rather than playing it.", "date": "July 20, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
