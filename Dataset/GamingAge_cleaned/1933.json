Both are from Dakko Dakko. Both have long, vaguely Asian names. Both are former PSP Minis getting the HD upgrade treatment. Both even arrived in the North American PlayStation Store on the same day. There might be two games with more similarities out therethough Im trying to think of any, and Im having trouble.There is, however, one major difference. As good as Rotating Octopus Character was, there was nothing about it that demanded it get the HD treatment. I mean, yes, Im glad its on the Vita, but its controls were so basic they could easily have been transferred over to any other system out there, smartphones included. By contrast, even knowing that it got its start on the PSP, Im having a hard time imagining Floating Cloud God working on any other system.See, its a shmup, and its one that demands to be played with two thumbsticks and a shoulder button. You could try and play with buttons or screen-swiping replacing those things to some extent, I guess, but I cant imagine it would work anywhere near as well as it does on the Vita.At the same time, however, its not such a fully-featured game that the experience would translate well to a full-on console experience. Lets be honest here: if youve played one level of Floating Cloud God Saves The Pilgrims in HD!, youve basically played them all. Its not like theres any in-depth story to follow, and even if there are boss fights and different types of enemies, you really dont have to vary your tactics up that much. While Im sure something similar could be said of some existing console games, I cant imagine Floating Cloud God would be improved in any way if you were to play it on a PS3 instead of a PS Vita.", "date": "September 10, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
