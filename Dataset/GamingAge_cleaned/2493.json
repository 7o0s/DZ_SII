Now for their own amusement, theyve decided to set up a golf course on the desecrated remains of their old homeworld. All the buildings are in shambles, and youre on the path to play through all 30+ holes on humanitys remnants. This is the premise of Golf Club: Wasteland that youre presented with going in.This all sounds very bleak and depressing, but the game is surprisingly soothing. You get to play all 30+ holes available on reclaimed Earth while getting played the soundtrack from Golf Club: Wastelands Radio Nostalgia From Mars. As you peacefully and carefully tee off from atop rusted cars and cargo containers, youre met with the soothing voice of the host of Radio Nostalgia. A broadcast of various stories from the few escapees, reminiscing on the things they miss most from the earth. Topped off with some pleasant music and a handful of friendly reminders for how to survive on Mars.Golf Club: Wasteland isnt a very long game (I beat it in about 2 hours), but the creative level design serves well for a good extra playthrough or two, in my experience. Youre offered a few different game types that challenge you to get better at the courses and learn all the little secret areas that act as a good excuse to give it one more go-round. If youre just looking for a stress-free mode, you can drop in to just ignore the stroke limit and explore the levels to your own desire.Theres a lot to discover and uncover in Golf Club: Wasteland. Each course offers rewards in the form of log entries, detailing the events that lead the character you play as to where he is now. The game may not be super long, but a lot of love is clearly present from the development team. If youre looking for a calm game to just kick back, put on some headphones and just play, few get to nearly the same level of peacefulness.", "date": "November 16, 2021", "grade": "B"}
