{"name": "OlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/03/olliolli2-welcome-to-olliwood-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "I have to be honest: if someone were to place screenshots or videos of OlliOlli and OlliOlli2 next to each other and told me to pick which was which, Im not sure Id be able to tell the original from the sequel. I mean, there are some minor cosmetic differences here and there, but on the whole, the two games are basically identical.Thats not the worst thing in the world, of course. The first OlliOlli was pretty phenomenal, so Im not going to complain that Roll7 havent innovated all that much the second time around. OllliOlli2 may lack that thrill of discovery that accompanied the first game, but it makes up for that by being its equal in every way.In fact, theres an argument to be made that it might even be ever so slightly better. While the visual differences may not be too great, theres at least an attempt to tell a story here  OlliOlli2 has borrowed a page from the Joe Danger playbook, and situates its levels on movie sets. Obviously were not exactly talking a huge narrative step forward, but it still provides a cohesion that may not have been there the first time out. (Not that it necessarily needed it, mind you  were talking about a skateboarding game, after all not some huge RPG where you need a story to sustain your interest through endless grinding.)OlliOlli2 also tries to make its mechanics a little easier to understand. The tutorial levels hold your hand a little more than the first game did, which is nice; the original OlliOlli challenged players right from the get-go, so its great that theyve tried to make the sequel a little more user-friendly. Its still an insanely hard game to master, of course, but at least OlliOlli2 makes an effort to help you learn.In the big scheme of things, though, the differences between the two games are pretty minimal. As I said, OlliOlli2 is still pretty darn hard; just passing each level requires you to whip your Vitas thumbsticks around in a way that cant be good for the systems longterm physical health. And if you want to really master the game? You might want to invest in buying a back-up Vita, just to be on the safe side.The good news (if that continued dedication to being insanely hard doesnt count as good news for you) is that OlliOlli2 is also just as addictive as its predecessor. It really knows how to use stars as rewards, slowly upping the degree of difficulty for each star on each progressive level, until you look up at some point and realize the game is asking you to do some really insane stuff.", "date": "March 19, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
