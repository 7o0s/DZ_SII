{"name": "Color Guardians", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/06/color-guardians-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Endless runners on the Vita have been pretty hit and miss. Even though youd expect the genre to be a natural fit on Sonys handheld  its thrived on mobile devices, after all  to date, there have been just as many duds (see the awful bad Z-Run, and the awfully racist Run Like Hell) as there have been games worth checking out.With such a spotty track record, its a welcome surprise to discover that Color Guardians falls into that latter category. In contrast with those two aforementioned games, its well-made, its nice to look at, and, most importantly, its fun.Of course, if you want to get all technical about it, its also not a traditional endless runner. It has less in common with, say, Run Sackboy Run, than it does with a game like Runner 2. Both, after all, take the usual endless runner conceit  start at Point A and run until you hit something  and add in a welcome dose of platforming.What does that mean? Only that it adds in a Point B. That may not sound like much, but in practice it means that Color Guardians  like Runner 2 before it  breaks down into more easily-digested levels, rather than just having one long, infinite level. Not only that, it means you get level bosses  and honestly, theres just something more satisfying about beating a boss than there is with running longer than you ever have before.While Color Guardians may hew close to the same formula as Runner 2, however, I dont think Id put it in quite the same league. It doesnt have the same strong writing or sense of humour, for starters. The plot is your standard bad guy stole all the colours trope, and it doesnt do much to build on that or make it more interesting. Likewise, while the game may be colourful, it doesnt come close to matching Runner 2s sense of style. It all feels very normal, for lack of a better descriptor; Color Guardians never conveys the kind of sparkle that made Runner 2 so incredible.", "date": "June 2, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
