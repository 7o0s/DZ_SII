{"name": "Murasaki Baby", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/09/murasaki-baby-review-ps-vita/", "text": "I dont really like kids very much. I know thats kind of a horrible thing to say, and if you have them Im sure yours are quite lovely, but I just cant stand them. I definitely dont find them cute, and the thought of having to do everything for some small, defenseless human holds precisely zero appeal.I have other reasons, too, but I mention those two things specifically because theyre basically the essence of Murasaki Baby: youre responsible for guiding a grotesque little girl through a world of equally grotesque horrors. In other words, its my nightmare idea of what it must be like to have a child.As terrifying as the scenario is (at least to me), though, my problems with the game dont stem from that. Indeed, to some extent, both of those things actually reflect the games strengths. First and foremost, the grotesquerie on display in Murasaki Baby is pretty cool, especially if youre a fan of Edward Gorey or Charles Addams. Danger lurks in every shadow, monster claws and tentacles grasp towards you, and the overall vibe of the game is is just delightfully creepy. Admittedly, Im not a huge fan of the titular characters cries, but I have to admit, they add to the aura the game is trying to project.Likewise, while its certainly annoying to have to guide the girl and her balloon through this horrifying world from the point of view of someone who doesnt want to be relied on, Ovosonico deserve all kinds of credit for making the most of the Vitas unique input scheme. In particular, they make better use of the back touch pad than any game since at least Tearaway, and theres even an argument to be made that Murasaki Baby uses it better.Unfortunately, whatever praise the game deserves for finally finding a use for that rear touch pad, it also deserves an equal amount of scorn for making such extensive use of the front touchscreen. You cant use buttons, and instead you literally have to drag the girl around by the hand. This wouldnt be a huge deal if it werent for the fact there are frequent sections that call for using multiple fingers in order to get through. Consequently, you get all the issues associated with touch gaming on a smartphone, plus the added problem of having to occasionally balance in touching the back of your Vita. I recently updated to the slimmer version of the device and I still found it to be a challenge, which means that if youre playing Murasaki Baby on an OG OLED Vita, youll almost definitely have literal balancing issues with the game.Murasaki Babys other issue is one of length: specifically, that you can beat this game in just a few hours. Im not inherently against games that are beatable in one sitting  Ive raved, to varying degrees, about both Entwined and Magus, and the same could be said for each of them  but it still does feel a little short. Then again, considering my problems with the controls, the games brevity may not be the worst thing in the world.", "date": "September 23, 2014", "grade": "B-"}
