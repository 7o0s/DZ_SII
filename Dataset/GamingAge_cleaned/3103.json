{"name": "Sudoku Universe", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/01/sudoku-universe-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "To some extent, Sudoku Universe is exactly what youd expect it to be based on its name. Its a collection of sudoku puzzles. If you like sudoku, youre in for a treat, and if you dontwell, you probably shouldve known what to expect based on the fact sudoku is right there in the name.The surprising thing about Sudoku Universe, though, is how varied the gameplay here is. Yes, about half of the game is straight-up sudoku, and lots of it. There are 200 classic-style sudoku puzzles, and they run the gamut of difficulty from very easy to painfully hard. If youre a fan of the number/logic game, youll get your fill of it here. Where Sudoku Universe is a little surprising, however, is in that it also includes modes called Sudoku Jigsaw and Sudoku Killer. Both take traditional sudoku and turn it into something entirely different. Jigsaw has a 9 by 9 grid, but rather than the board being broken up into the usual 3 by 3 squares, its shapes like a jigsaw puzzle, with each piece comprised of 9 weirdly-shaped squares. The game never actually explains how it works, though, so its significantly more challenging than the standard sudoku puzzle. Still, if youre looking for something thats similar in principle to sudoku and yet totally different, it should be up your alley.As for Sudoku Killer, its very much like sudoku, but with extra layers of math and logic. Not only do you have to fill in the grid, you have to make sure that the numbers you use also add up to a certain amount. Also, it doesnt give you any starting points, so its extra sadistic. Much like Jigsaw, itll test in the same way the main sudoku games here will, but with much, much more of a challenge.", "date": "January 12, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
