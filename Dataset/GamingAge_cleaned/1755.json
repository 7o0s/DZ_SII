{"name": "FEZ", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/04/fez-review-ps-vita-ps4-ps3/", "text": "Im sure Ive said this before, but I usually find it harder to write about games I dont like than games I do. This is mainly because when a game sucks, I can point to every little aspect of it that I hate, whereas when I love a game, its more for the intangible joy that it brings me. How do you write about intangible joy?Which brings me to Fez. I love it, and initially I thought it was going to be another case of not being able to put my finger on exactly what about it I loved so much. At some point, however, it hit me: those annoying little problems its so easy to name in hard games? The fact a game like Fez doesnt have those is just as much a point in its favour as the flaws of platformers like Mutant Mudds or Cloudberry Kingdom or any of the zillions of other indie retro platformers out there are points against.Or, to put it more simply, everything in Fez just works. Like in any other great platformer  as in the original Mario games, or the early Sonic games, or even the recent Rayman games  Fezs creators seem to have realized that the way to make your game good is to not hit players over the head with bells and whistles, but instead to just make the game seem as straightforward and easy to pick-up as possible.Which isnt to say Fez actually is straightforward or easy. No, its actually pretty tough. It expects you to think through your path through each level, to plan ahead and watch what youre doing. Youre constantly expected to shift the world around you, to find ways forward without getting rid of the ground beneath you. Its a challenge, to be sure.But, unlike too many other games of its ilk, Fez never lets its mechanics get in the way of its gameplay. You never feel as if youre fighting with the game to make anything happen. Its as if Polytron (and, I guess, the infamous Phil Fish) realized that their game would be hard enough without making you fight with the controls, too.All that said, I do have one complaint to make: there are times when its hard to tell where youre supposed to go next. Youre racing around worlds full of doors that lead from one island to another, and it was awfully easy to lose track of where youd already been and where youre supposed to go next.", "date": "April 14, 2014", "grade": "A"}
