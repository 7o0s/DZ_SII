You manage the flow of traffic, and make sure streets full of bad drivers dont wind up filled with collisions.Now, I couldve sworn Id played this exact game somewhere before. In fact, going in I wouldve said with at least 99% certainty that Id played this exact game before, somewhere, whether as a browser game or a mobile game or something. But, for the life of me, I cant seem to find the game Im picturing in my head anywhere online. Which means that either a) my Google skills are seriously failing me, or b) Urban Flow is a surprisingly original game.If we start from the latter premise, Id say that its probably the mark of a very good casual game when it feels like its built around the most basic, most obvious hook in the world, but it doesnt exist yet. Sure, there are a couple of games by which Urban Flow is very clearly influenced  Flight Control being the most obvious, and there are bits of Conduct Together! and Mini Metro in here too  but, generally speaking, what youre getting is something that feelswell, not original, necessarily, but still all its own.In this case, the mechanic is about as straightforward as they come: you have to manage the flow of traffic on a busy street, making sure cars driven by people with apparently zero spatial awareness dont crash into each other. You have sets of traffic lights scattered around the screen, and you have to flick them between red and green.Its simple, but the way its done here makes it not only incredibly challenging, but also incredibly stressful. The drivers having no sense of self-preservation is one of the obstacles, but there are plenty of others. The street layouts frequently feel like they were designed by sadists, with turns coming from all over the place and lights in some truly bizarre locations. Ambulances bearing dying patients are common occurrences, and they have little time to waste sitting at stoplights. Train tracks run right through the middle of intersections and across streets, for some reason, and they stop for no one. I wasnt far into Urban Flows 100 levels before my heart was pounding.Strangely, despite the tension, it sometimes feels like the game is actually trying to make you feel zen. Not only are you theoretically trying to achieve the flow in Urban Flow and make the cars all zip back and forth in some difficult-to-discern pattern, the music and visuals are actually kind of calming, if you divorce them from the gameplay. Mind you, its hard to do that on account of how tense this game gets, but I think thats where its heart lies.", "date": "July 17, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
