It certainly shows that Square Enix took note from the numerous critical responses to different aspects of XIII, and tried their best to apply that feedback in a positive way to the sequel. Does it fix every single issue? No, and youd probably have to dump the setting completely to do so, but overall its definitely an improvement.To start with, combat feels quicker this time out, and certainly a far cry from some of the long, drawn out, laborious battles found in XIIIs story. Sure, the side quests of XIII-2 still have some tough fights, and a couple boss encounters in the story managed to throw me for a loop, but overall the game feels a little less grindy than the original. The Paradigm system returns, but switching between your Paradigm set-ups is quicker, and theres less emphasis on staggering foes to defeat them.The addition of monster collecting is a big plus, and far more addictive than I would have thought. Your main party is only composed of two characters, Serah and Noel. The third member of your party comes from your collection of monsters. The monsters come with defined roles, like Ravager, Commando, Sentinel and so on. Theyre not quite as flexible as the actual cast, but theres a fun component involved with their leveling system that involves combining different monsters to carry over passive skills, and using item drops to level them up.If youre going for a full roster, youll need a lot of free time on your hands. But Ive found that its certainly worth the time spent if you plan on seeing everything the game has to offer, as youll need some fairly powerful companions to take on some of the optional battles outside of the story.Also worth mentioning is that I found the plot of XIII-2 more interesting than its predecessor, but thats not saying much. I didnt care for XIIIs tale at all, I found all the factions and terms were difficult to keep track of, and constantly found myself losing interest in the overall plot. I also didnt care for a number of characters, so pairing down the cast quite a bit in XIII-2 seems to have helped. I also find that Noel, a new addition, is actual a pretty solid leading male character, and the villain of the game is far more memorable than Orphan or whatever the hell the main bad guy from XIII was.The time travel element that features heavily in XIII-2s plot isnt great, in that it never really explores the possibilities of time travel in a satisfying way. You do get to jump backwards and forwards in time, but the overall effect your actions have on the timeline always seems underwhelming. And theres no satisfying take on alternate universe versions of characters. In fact, the only real character that undergoes any significant change is Hope, but even thats mitigated because every time you encounter him, hes identical to how you left him from his first appearance in the game. The only real difference is that hes slightly older and certainly more tolerable as a character than he was in XIII, but thats hardly an exciting change.Other members of XIIIs cast make appearances as well, but again, I feel like revisiting these characters across various timelines never has much of an impact. And while I wasnt big on the cast from XIII, Id still like to have seen these established characters used in a more interesting manner if they had to be shoehorned into the plot.Some of the other complaints that numerous people leveled against Final Fantasy XIII have also been addressed. Exploration is actually a thing this time out, so theres less linear paths through multiple corridors and more wide open spaces similar to Gran Pulse from the original game. The world is divided up into a series of areas accessible through an overworld map that represents various timelines, so it does feel a little segmented, but each area generally provides you enough freedom that youll want to check out every nook and cranny presented for treasure or other secrets.The leveling system is also a lot more flexible, and while Noel and Serah certainly seem to fit certain roles more so than others, you can pretty much pick and choose what type of character you want them to be. Theres no real restriction, so Noel can be a medic/sentinel/ravager, or if you play enough, can just max out every single role in the game.The soundtrack seems to be largely improved, providing a lot more memorable tracks than just the main theme (which is also heavily used again). However, theres definitely a blow delivered to the crisp, beautiful visuals of XIII. Its not a huge downgrade, but you can tell that this game certainly didnt have the same development cycle of the original. Its definitely not bad, but there are some jarring differences to be found when comparing the two games, and for whatever reason the framerate seems to take a noticeable hit, often clocking in below 30 frames per second.", "date": "January 31, 2012", "grade": "B"}
