{"name": "Assassins Creed III", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/12/assassins-creed-iii/", "text": "Dont play Assassins Creed III before playing everything else leading up to this or at the very least Assassins Creed 2. I made the presumption that Id be able to figure it out despite skipping a couple of games, which was a big mistake, as there isnt much backstory in AC3. Instead they say something along the lines of, we made it here with an almost entirely new cast of characters and entirely different reasons for our actions Lets save the world with the power of our ancestors! figuring you know whats going on. So, its definitely not a good idea given how story driven the game is. Fortunately the gameplay is as smooth as ever (PC version included) and you quickly melt into the awesomeness of all the running, climbing, and stealth killing that comprises the Assassins Creed experience.Let me try to sum it up so you have an idea of whats happening (as a refresher for those that might not recall the previous games or for those gamers living under a rock.) The Knights Templars and Assassins Brotherhood have been at each others throats for centuries vying over control of artifacts left over by humanitys predecessors. These predecessors were superior to modern day humans in pretty much every way, but to spite their best efforts they were wiped out by a solar flare Similar to the one that the Mayan calendar suggests is going to happen in 2012 (this month, no less).Heres the rub; using a machine called the Animus, modern humans can re-live the lives of their ancestors. Enter Desmond Miles, an average dude who just so happens to come from a long lineage of assassins. As the player, youve assumed the role of Desmond (and his ancestors) throughout the Assassins Creed franchise. In Assassins Creed III when Desmond is in the Animus he controls Connor (aka Ratonahekekj:Ho), his native-American great-great-(great?)-grandfather, during the American Revolution; meaning you meet up with such shifty characters as Sam Adams, George Washington, and Benny Franklin.So there it is  with the 2012 end of days approaching, Desmond has been using the Animus to re-live the lives of his assassin ancestors to find artifacts needed to start a machine created by humanitys predecessors in order to protect the Earth, all the while trying to avoid the Knights Templars who are actively looking for him and his compadres in both the past lives he re-lives in the Animus and his regular real life in contemporary times. Pardon the run-on, but I wanted to get all that out in one go (hopefully you read that sentence in one breath).So you can see why youd be better off playing through the franchise.Assassins Creed III basically takes what Ubisoft learned in the previous games and then tacks on a whole bunch of other stuff that, honestly, I had to actively avoid so I wouldnt get side-tracked off the campaign. The problem I had is that there are as many elements that feel integral to the game (and are liquid smooth), as there are elements that are unnecessary wastes of time, and clunky feeling by comparison. All of these elements  good and bad  are almost exhaustively deep in terms of mechanics and duration.I cant believe Im saying this, but its as if there is too much game here. I constantly felt that I was missing out on stuff and after a while I started wondering if I should just stick to playing campaign missions only. Its kind of like Grand Theft Auto, but with ~40 hours of campaign with endless amounts of open-worldness on top of that (whereas GTA is like a 15-20 hours campaign and then endless of hours of fun and exploration.)The amount of time it takes to learn/master a mechanic is just enough time to realize it has little-to-no bearing on the story and that it may not even help you in the long run. For example, you can spend hours building up your town with allegiances to earn money and to buy cool gear, only to realize that youre better off using the default assassins horoscope for sagittarius will find a key to the vain heart of Leos, also charging them with their energy and thirst for life. blades that you had from the get-go. After a while you kind of lose track of the who and why and instead spend your time merely getting from one point to another (wherever the map says to go) And thats all within the Animus. When you take breaks from colonial times, and resume your role as modern day Desmond, you realize just how much time youve been wasting by doing random crap and exploring 18th century America.Ironically, the modern day bits were some of my favorite and I quickly realized the difference: almost everything outside of the animus has to do with moving the main narrative forward. Theres no dicking around hunting or taking on superfluous missions to win favor of a group of people that wont make upcoming endeavors easier.Theres gobs and gobs of game; you can do sea-bound missions as the captain of a ship (which you use to get from place to place), or play the well fleshed out multiplayer, Your cheap medical insurance company will pay the other 80 percent ($800). or take advantage of the commerce system to earn money, endless hunting, random NPC side missions, finding collectibles and gambling, replaying missions to maintain full synchronization it goes on and on. Its like an RPG, but without the necessity of leveling up to unlock abilities (or gear, etc.) that are required to move forward In other words, its often overwhelming. I finally got my assassins uniform after almost 20 hours of playtime, at which point I decided to only do campaign missions for fear of getting burnt out or fatigued on the game before finishing it. Yeah, its like that.Technically the game is pretty solid. As with any open-world title that takes place in vast forests and Olde Tyme cities, clipping and NPC awkwardness are to be expected, but visually its the best looking and sounding in the franchise. On PC I had no problems maxing it out at 1080p/60fps and with a 360 controller it plays exactly as youd expect from the console version  so youre not missing anything that way. One thing I found weird was that cinematics and load screens (running around a blank Animus room) tended to spring up out of nowhere. Sometimes youd be killing a whole slew of people and itd just pop into a cinematic or Animus loading room even though you may not have necessarily been gunning for the target. Kind of frustrating as this usually happens when you fail a stealth kill and end up with dozens of bodies piled up around you that couldve been looted but disappear when you come out of the cinematic/load screen.Speaking of killing, the combat system has been simplified for the better. Holding down B blocks and parries, while tapping it at the appropriate times causes your attacker to be vulnerable doing a bullet-time type slow-down at which point hitting X or A allows you to insta-kill or disarm him.) Its smoother than I remember, and more satisfying, and survivable, when youre surrounded by a bunch of red coats. Another aspect that I appreciated was free-running amongst the trees in the forests surrounding Boston or the Homestead. While I still prefer running along the bungalows of Damascus, jumping between branches and across rivers in the lush wilderness is pretty satisfying. Conversely, I felt being in the colonial cities of early Merica to be kind of muddled and tempo-destroying (roofs are too far apart and climbing the building takes too long since theyre all two stories.)Assassins Creed III is a game you should only start when youve got a buttload of time to spare (like over the holidays!) Its long, but the more you play the better it gets, so you will invariably spend a lot of time with it. It should come with a warning: dont get suckered into playing everything that the game provides on your first playthrough. The biggest problem with a game this deep is that all the distractions prevent you from actually getting through the campaign, which I admit is fairly bizarre (and could be a very subjective criticism.) I kept thinking that playing through certain aspects were either required or would benefit me, when they actually werent, and I could have just as easily blitzed through the campaign.", "date": "December 11, 2012", "grade": "B"}
