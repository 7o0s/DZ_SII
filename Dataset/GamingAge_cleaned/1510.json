After all, its a fishing game, and Ive been a strict vegan for nearly a decade. On top of that, it features a super-maudlin story about the games protagonist visiting his late dads old cabin, where be reflects on his fathers life as he prepares to become a father himself. While I get along just fine with my own dad, I cant imagine there being any kind of similar pilgrimages in my future when that unfortunate time comes, and Im probably even more hardcore about my childfree-ness than I am about being vegan. Im sure there are ways this game could feature a lifestyle and a belief system thats even more diametrically opposed to mine than thisbut Im struggling to think of how they might do it. That said, theres a lot to be said for video games as a vehicle for escapism. Ive never been and almost certainly will never be a trigger-happy treasure hunter, a vengeful Greek god or a farmer, but that never stopped me from loving the Uncharted, God of War or Farming Simulator franchises. Likewise, even if I cant imagine a scenario in which Im actually an expectant father going fishing, I have to say: Reel Fishing does a pretty decent job of making it seen enjoyable. I think it works for the same reason the Farming Simulator games work. Its not flashy or action-packed, but it does a great job of lulling you into its simple, straightforward rhythms. Reel Fishing obviously has much more of a story, but the games basic routine seldom varies: you wake up, you reminisce about your father, you go fishing. Occasionally you break that up by heading down to the store to buy more bait and chat with the shopkeeper, who reminds you of your dad. Its not the most riveting game, obviously, but in its own subtle way, its surprisingly addictive.I also think its surprisingly grossbut thats just my veganism talking. Personally, Im kind of appalled by the sight of fish flopping around on the ground after youve reeled them in, gasping for air as they slowly die out of the water. (And the little subplot of fixing the cabins aquarium to house the fish doesnt excuse it for me.) That said, from an objective point of view, realistic-looking fish in a fishing game can only be considered a good thing.I also have to commend Natsume for making a game with such simple, easy-to-understand controls. As the execrable Lets Fish: Hooked On showed, its shockingly easy to make a fishing game with terrible controls, so good on Natsume for making their game so wonderfully intuitive.", "date": "February 19, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
