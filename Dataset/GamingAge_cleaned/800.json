While I cant speak to the console versions, on Vita Ive always found them to be delightfully zen. Its easy to get into a pleasant rhythm of planting-harvesting-selling-repeat, to the point that you can look up at suddenly discover youve spent the better part of an afternoon playing pretend farmer.In a broad sense, Farming Simulator 18 continues this tradition. Youre still balancing a variety of crops, you still have the option of raising animals as well, and you still have to manage a fleet of farm vehicles. There are additions here and there  this time out you can plant sunflowers and raise pigs!  but, as I said, from a 30,000-foot perspective, this is roughly the same game as the previous handheld editions.That said, Farming Simulator 18 feels a little different to me. Each successive handheld version has gradually made the world just a bit bigger, to the point that, this time out, it almost feels a little overwhelming to just jump in and start farming again. Luckily, you can hire labourers to take on the grunt work of, well, farming, but that almost feels like cheating, and it certainly takes away some of the zen-ness.At the same time, however, expanding the world means that Farming Simulator is gradually feeling a little more complete. I still remember how empty the map was for the first Farming Simulator Vita game, so to see this one include a full-on town, complete with buildings that have nothing to do with farming or agriculture, is a sign of how far its come.", "date": "July 7, 2017", "grade": "B-"}
