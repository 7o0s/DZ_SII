{"name": "Resident Evil Revelations 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/09/resident-evil-revelations-2-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Ill be honest here: the odds of me disliking Resident Evil Revelations 2 on the Vita were extraordinarily slim from the get-go. No matter how much I may love indie games, no matter how much Ive come to appreciate Japanese games, the truth is, Im always eager to play more full-fledged 3D action game on Sonys handheld. I didnt have any illusions about it, obviously: I didnt expect Id be getting another Uncharted: Golden Abyss or Killzone Mercenary or anything, but I figured this late port would fill a niche thats been a little underserved in recentwell, years, if were being realistic.To say, then, that RE Revelations 2 lived up to my expectations probably doesnt mean all that much. It delivers that action game fix I was hoping for, and it does so in a fully competent manner. There arent any game-breaking bugs or glitches, the controls generally work as theyre supposed to, and the whole thing more or less approximates the experience the game presumably delivered on consoles. (I say presumably because I forwent those console versions in favour of waiting for the game on the Vita.)While the preceding paragraph may leave the impression that I was wholly underwhelmed by RE Revelations 2s Vita version, thats not entirely accurate. Rather, Id say I wasI dont know, whelmed. Not dazzled, not disappointed, just generally okay with the whole thing.Pick some aspect of the game, and Id say I was relatively satisfied by it. The graphics? Theyrealright. Most of the cutscenes look moderately nice, but as soon as the action begins everything gets substantially uglier. Ive seen worse  far, far worse  but I dont think anyone would ever mistake this for one of the Vitas better looking games.Likewise, the controls are kind of iffy. There arent any egregious missteps, but at the same time, too often the game will suddenly require very precise movements where it hadnt done so before. Generally its more annoying than anything else, but when you get attacked by monsters after you didnt approach a weapon or a ladder from just the right angle, its easy to get a little frustrated.If and when you die from finicky controls, though, youll have plenty of time to get over it, since Resident Evil Revelations 2 has some of the worst load times outside of the first Telltale Walking Dead game. Interminably dull is really the only way to describe them, since they generally consist of nothing more than a black screen with Loading in tiny little letters in the bottom corner.", "date": "September 4, 2015", "grade": "B"}
