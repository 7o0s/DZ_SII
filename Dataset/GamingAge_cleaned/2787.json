{"name": "Bug Academy", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/12/bug-academy-review-for-nintendo-switch-xbox-one/", "text": "Im having a hard time making up my mind about Bug Academy. Its a physics-based puzzler where the controls are kind of iffy, which makes it a little frustrating. However, the point of it is that youre controlling bugs, and asking them to do things like lift cows and paint pictures, so a) its not like realistic physics are the point here, and b) a little frustration is probably intentionally baked into the game.Because of that latter point, I think I fall on the side of enjoying Bug Academy. No matter how frustrating it can occasionally be, Id be lying if I said I didnt love launching cows through easily-shattered castles, or delivering furniture to apartments in outer space.Thats the gist of the game, in case thats not clear. You take control of four different bugs  house flies, fireflies, mosquitos, and bumblebees  and you run them through a series of tasks, whether its picking up and tossing cows over long distances, or sucking up paint and trying to replicate a picture, or finding your way through a maze to try and steal a diamond. Its absurd, but when it all works right, its great, goofy fun.The problem is that it doesnt always work just right. As I said up top, the controls arent exactly precise, which means youll regularly have to fiddle around with how your bugs are moving around in order to get them just right. Most of the time its not an issue, but when you get into levels where you need to drop items in just the right spot in order to advance, or where your score (out of three stars, naturally) is dependent on your time, you can see why you dont want to be moving your flies a fraction of an inch at a time, trying to get them just so.For the most part, though, thats not a huge concern. A couple of annoying moments here and there cant detract from an overall fun experience, so as long as you go into Bug Academy with that mindset, you should be able to enjoy it.", "date": "December 14, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
