{"name": "Fairune", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/09/fairune-review-ps-vita/", "text": "As someone who prefers when games are simple and straightforward, I have to say: Fairune makes me question that preference.In pretty much every respect, the game feels like a NES or SNES RPG stripped down to its most basic elements and set loose upon the world. The story is as generic as it gets: a girl has to find gems to stop evil. The graphics, the characters, the music: all of these things feel like they couldve come from any RPG of a few decades ago.This feeling carries over into the gameplay. Combat is barely even present: it consists entirely of you walking into enemies. If youre strong enough to kill them they die, and if youre not, you bounce off them. If you take on an enemy slightly above your abilities, then you also lose a point or two off your life bar. The puzzles are equally walking-into-things-based: you wander around the map looking to uncover secrets, and when you bounce into the right place, it solves the puzzle. The whole thing can be finished in about two hours.Or so Im told: if Im being honest, I gave up on this game about halfway through, because even with its streamlined mechanics, Fairune still feels like a huge grind. Leveling up is based entirely on how many times you can go back and forth across the map, bumping into enemies; likewise, as I said, solving puzzles requires no greater ability than being able to move your character around with the d-pad or thumbstick. I like it when games simplify things for me, but this takes the idea of simplified to an extreme.", "date": "September 13, 2017", "grade": "D+"}
