{"name": "Beyond Eyes", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/10/beyond-eyes-review-for-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "As art, Beyond Eyes is extraordinarily laudable: it wants to help players understand what its like to be blind. If the purpose of art is to help you understand different perspectives, its neat to see a game embrace a point of view thats not very well-served in most media, video games or otherwise.Not only that, it conveys that perspective via a story thats sure to tug at your heartstrings. You play Beyond Eyes as Rae, a young girl whos lost her sight, but who nonetheless wants to find out what happened to a cat that kept her company as she recovered from the accident that caused her impairment. If youre looking for an emotional hook, it doesnt get much stronger than blind girl searches for her lost kitty.Unfortunately, no matter how much emotional heft Beyond Eyes carries, its impossible to get around the fact its boring. Just excruciatingly dull from start to finish. You know how some games are derisively called walking simulators? Playing Beyond Eyes, I suddenly understood exactly how and why people might use that as an insult. You dont really do anything here except for walk. This is a game where major obstacles include barking dog and pressing the crosswalk button and path leading to nowhere. I hate to make light of those things, because I have no doubt that visually impaired people  and especially visually impaired children  have to learn to deal with them on a daily basisbut seriously, its not exactly the sort of thing that translates well to a game.One of the greater ironies of Beyond Eyes is that, for a game thats about not being able to see anything, it looks really nice. As the world fades in and out of Raes understanding, its like youre watching a watercolor painting flashing in and out of existence before your eyes.", "date": "October 1, 2015", "grade": "C-"}
