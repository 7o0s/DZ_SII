{"name": "Fin and the Ancient Mystery", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/05/fin-and-the-ancient-mystery-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "I havent counted them all, but Id estimate there are probably several hundred platformers on the Switch. Im not exaggerating or being facetious or anything here (there are about 3,700 games listed for the Switch on Nintendos site as of this writing, and as someone who scours the release lists every week, it seems safe to say there are at least a few new platformers every week), but simply stating a matter of fact.Consequently, for a 2D platformer to stand out, it has to do something really special, something unique that makes it stand out from all the others.Fin and the Ancient Mystery does not.Dont get me wrong, Ive played much, much worse than this game. Its competently made. It looks nice enough. It controls as youd expect it to. Its not broken, Basically, it does pretty much everything youd expect from a 2D platformer.But it doesnt do anything more than that, and thats where the problem is. The story is your typical Save the world from the evil force that youd find everywhere else. The controls are exactly what youd expect them to be: you jump, you double-jump, you have a sword, and you can fire magic. The levels are super-generic: theres your forest level, your desert level, your underground level, your Hell level, and so on. The enemies are wholly forgettable, apart from the fact they respawn a little quickly.Basically, if youve ever played any 2D platformer at any point in your life, youll know exactly what to expect from Fin and the Ancient Mystery. As I said, you could do a lot worse than this one, but given the sheer number of alternatives on the Switch alone, theres really no reason why youd want to pick this one specifically.", "date": "May 6, 2020", "grade": "C"}
