I loved their first few games, but then I hated Mages and Treasures, their second-most recent game, Now theyre back with Slimes Journey, and I hate this one, too.In fact, I might dislike this one more than Mages and Treasures, since in some ways Slimes Journey is an even bigger step back from their previous successes. At least Mages and Treasures worked, even if it was boring, uninspired and unbalanced. Slimes Journey is boring, uninspired, and unbalanced as well, but on top of that its also occasionally broken.I should have known I was in for trouble when the game got stuck in a weird loop literally five seconds in. My character  the titular Slime  exited the room he started the game in, and then the game got stuck as it couldnt decide if I was entering or leaving the room, and it endlessly flashed back and forth between the inside and the outside until I quit and restarted.This time I was able to make it all the way to the first boss fight, at which point my progress got waylaid once again, this time partially by the fact that the instructions for beating the boss were hidden by the boss health bar. Eventually I beat it, but it was no thanks to the game.My difficulty here also highlights one of the other big problems with Slimes Journey: its quite unbalanced. The non-boss enemies are absurdly easy to beat, and barely take any effort  they get a little tougher and less predictable the further in you get, but theyre never that challenging. Then you make it to the boss levels, and suddenly youre facing enemies who double as bomb sponges (since your slime picks up little bombs everywhere, obviously). The difficulty spikes are ridiculous.Of course, the flip side of that is that everything outside of the boss fights is excruciatingly dull. None of the rooms are that interesting, and its a good thing that theres a map (which you press triangle to call up, and I mention that because the game doesnt tell you), because otherwise itd be really easy to go back and forth through the same room several times since theyre so similar, at least within each new area. I realize Im spending way too much time complaining about a game thats only $5. But the fact is, this developer used to be a reliable source of fun, inexpensive retro-tinged games. As Slimes Journey shows, lightUPs games are still inexpensive and retro-tinged, but theyre certainly not very fun.", "date": "January 26, 2023", "grade": "D+"}
