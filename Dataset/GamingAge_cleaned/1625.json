Now go to the next paragraph.And heres a new paragraph. And another sentence. No, sorry, you shouldnt have read that last sentence! Anyway, heres one more sentence to read. And one last sentence. And now you can read the review!If you want some idea of what the first couple of sections of Natural Doctrine are like, the preceding two paragraphs are pretty much it in a nutshell. Tutorial screen after tutorial screen, including some screens that tell you to do something in one breath, only for you to find out they were only giving you directions on whatnotto do once the sequence is over and done with. This is a game that has a lot of ideas as to how you should be playing it, and it never hesitates for a second to make sure you find out exactly what all those ideas are.Id really like to say that all that preparation is worth it once the game actually lets you loose in its world, but that would be a lie. While the tutorials may end after youve visited the first couple of locations, the insistence you do everything a certain way or elsedoesnt. Try and do things in a different order than the game intends, try and attack enemies before the game wants you to, try and explore areas before the game wants you to discover them  do any of that, and youre likely to be seeing a Game Over screen before too long.On some level, I guess, this makes sense: Natural Doctrine is a Strategy RPG, and it takes that genre classification very seriously. If you want to advance in this game, you need to take a strategic approach to everything you do, and if you dontwell, tough luck.Of course, thats also the games major flaw. As far as its concerned, theres only one proper approach to take in any given situation, and it strictly punishes anyone who wants to approach problems in a different way. Considering one of the major joys of gaming is finding your own way through created worlds, you can see why such a strict approach is less than enjoyable.Thats not Natural Doctrines only flaw, either. The graphics are pretty standard RPG fare, though in this case the line between generic and eyesore is pretty thin. The games cast of characters is pretty rote, too, and Im not afraid to predict that however youre picturing typical JRPG hero/heroine, youre probably picturing the characters here. And, to top it all off, the voice acting isflat, to be charitable (or laughably bad, to be not).And yet, despite all those obvious flaws, I wouldnt say the game is wholly devoid of charms. Natural Doctrine may have been frequently annoying, but at the same time, theres a certain satisfaction to be gained from finally figuring out exactly what it is the game wants you to do. Likewise, while most of the time the game looks completely generic, I loved seeing the games World Map in action  its seemingly designed to look like something straight out of a board game, complete with your characters being moved around like a game piece.", "date": "September 30, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
