{"name": "Oddworld: Munchs Oddysee HD", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/01/oddworld-munchs-oddysee-hd-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Im not generally prone to motion sickness. I can read and game on the bus, in a moving car, etc., without feeling like Im going to vomit. I was able to sit through the Blair Witch Project (many years ago) without being overcome by waves of nausea. And yet, even with all that in my past, I find myself having to pause Oddworld: Munchs Oddysee HD every so often, just because it was kind of doing a number of my stomach.Or, to put it in less cutesy terms: wow, is the camera here ever terrible.Honestly, I dont know when I last played a game where it felt like I was fighting more with the camera than actual in-game enemies. When the titular Munch was outside, in relatively wide open spaces, it was a huge challenge to find a remotely useful camera angle. And when I was indoors, or a high ledge, or somewhere else where the number of angles was constrained? You can easily imagine how that went; almost invariably, Id end up seeing Munch from the one perspective that didnt help me.So thats one issue. Surprisingly, though, it may also be the only issue  or, at least, the only significant one. Sure, the graphics look a little muddy and the voice acting is kind of annoying, but neither of those things are so bad that they tangibly harm the game. Considering the last Oddworld port, New n Tasty, felt like a relic of an earlier time even with upgrades, youd think that Munchs Oddysee HD would feel really dated, but thats not the case. No one would be able to mistake it for a game made in the 2010s, but at the same time I dont think anyone would write it off as being stale or outdated, either.This is entirely attributable to the fact that the gameplay stands up so well. The objectives are always clear, the controls are easy to figure out and to master, and, perhaps most impressively, there are segments in which your character has to swim that dont completely suck, which might just be the rarest thing in gaming.", "date": "January 16, 2015", "grade": "B"}
