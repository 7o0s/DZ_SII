Like those other four, Barry the Bunny doesnt do anything that hasnt been done countless times before. Its a fairly straightforward platformer thats a little tougher than the developers previous outings, but its not some kind of twitchy platformer that requires insane reflexes. The visuals are fairly similar to each of the developers previous games. Its not like theres some gripping story keeping you invested.But all that may be why Im such a fan of Barry the Bunny (and lightUPs other games). It doesnt try to be anything more than it is  and what it is is a very solid platformer. It challenges you, to be sure, but it never asks you to do anything impossible. The levels are just the right length  long enough to be interesting, but short enough to plow through them one after the other.Basically, Barry the Bunny keeps you playing level after level, and then wraps up well before it has a chance to wear out its welcome. Its not going to break new ground, but, like every other game from lightUP so far, its going to provide you with a very enjoyable experience for only a couple of dollars.", "date": "October 11, 2021", "grade": "B+"}
