The game features 15 levels; the Platinum pops moments into the fourth level. Even by Ratalaikas usual standards of making Platinums pop way too soon, a Platinum you can get before youve even finished 25% of the game is insane.Whats worse, Orbibot is a decent-enough ball-rolling platformer that giving players a reason to quit so early means that lots of people will miss out on a game that isnt half-bad.Its by no means original, of course. It follows in the footsteps of every game that ever emulated Marble Madness: you roll a ball around a course, solving puzzles here and there on your way to the end point.But even if its just like countless other games, its still enjoyable enough for what it is. The levels are lengthy, the puzzles are just challenging enough to make you work a little (though not always for the right reasons  more on that in a second), and the game as a whole looks pretty nice. Orbibot wont change the way you look at these marble-rolling games, but Ive certainly played worse.Mind you, Ive also played better, and thats because Orbibots controls  in fact, its whole system of physics  arent the greatest. The marble youre controlling is almost weightless, and you can never totally tell which way its going to roll, or how quickly, or whether youll get a sudden burst of speed for no apparent reason. Likewise, you have to fight with the camera constantly to get a good angle, which means youll spend a lot of time rolling right off the edge of a platform into nothingness and starting from the last checkpoint.But even with these flaws and this lack of originality, Orbibot is an okay game. Its not going to blow you away, but its certainly decent enough that you should keep playing after the Platinum Trophy pops", "date": "December 1, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
