{"name": "Rush Rover", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/05/rush-rover-review-for-ps4-ps-vita-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "I cant say that Rush Rover has much in the way of personality. Notwithstanding its store description as being a story of robots ruling over a post-apocalyptic wasteland, the reality is that its a procedurally-generated top-down dungeon-crawler where your robot wanders around shooting swarms of other robots and occasionally gets into a boss fight.Initially, I thought my boredom with the game was because I wasnt very good at it. After all, I was getting killed early on, and I wasnt seeing very much of what the game had to offer. Maybe it would getting better once I figured out how to unlock better weapons?Then I unlocked the rocket launcherand nope, still bored.Dont get me wrong, it was briefly cool to rain bombs down on my robot enemies. Coupled with the fact I could lock onto targets, I was basically able to enter a new room and kill everything within seconds. I racked up all the trophies Rush Rover had to offer in a matter of minutes (it is a Ratalaika game, after all), and I was feeling slightly more positive.But those feelings of positivity gave way to ennui as I realized theres really nothing more here once you unlock the really good weapons  which is something that happens really early on. I only died once I got so bored with the omnipotence that I stopped trying to dodge enemy shots, which hardly suggests a game thats going to keep most people entertained for hours on end.Basically, Rush Rover is a nondescript game thats only worth playing for the trophies or achievements, if those appeal to you. It offers a few minutes of fun, but pretty much nothing else beyond that.", "date": "May 4, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
