You play as either half of an elderly couple who are unhappy about a highway and bridge being built near their property, so they decide to take matters into their own hands and blow up cars as they cross.As someone whose gaming mantra is the more explosions, the better, I have to say, that kind of scenario appeals to me.Whats also appealing: the fact that CrossKrush is pretty fun. Its not at all complicated, either  which is part of why its so fun. As the cars cross the bridge in blocks, you set explosives in their path, and they blow up as soon as you trigger them. Occasionally you get cars packed with TNT or cars that leave explosive residue behind after they explode, which add to the destruction, and you need to avoid blowing up ambulances, but generally speaking, what youre doing in Level 1 is the same thing as what youre doing in Level 10. On top of that, its all short enough  10 short waves per level  that you never feel like the game is dragging on well past the point of it being fun.Mind you, the flip side of that is you kind of wish there were a little more to do, since whats here is so enjoyable. There are a couple of slightly different modes  a mode where the cars go faster, a one-hit death mode, a mode where explosion holes stay until they get paved over, and a two-player version  but they dont substantially change anything, and it feels like there are more directions this game could have potentially gone.Still, its always better for a game to leave you wanting more than making you lose interest long before it ends. CrossKrush is just the right amount of quirky and challenging to make it well worth an hour or so.", "date": "December 4, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
