{"name": "Ninja Gaiden 3", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/03/ninja-gaiden-3-review-for-ps3-xbox-360/", "text": "Ninja Gaiden 3 is one of those games where the experience is a little better if youve never had any exposure to the series before. The developers, Team Ninja, have certainly tried their hardest to make this entry as accessible as possible to newcomers. But that comes at the expense of whats been so appealing about the franchise for years now. The combat feels dumbed down, less fluid, and with more emphasis on cinematic wow moments than actually pulling off stunning moves due to skill. Theres still some of what makes Ninja Gaiden such a hardcore action fans dream, but not enough to satiate long-time fans.Ryu Hayabusa still takes on the main role here, and youll still be cutting through numerous enemies, fellow Ninja, monsters, mutants, and lots of soldiers. The whole morality tale that intertwines the plot is throw away nonsense, trying to prove that Ryu is a good man and not a cold-blooded killer doesnt exactly jive with all the on-screen slaughtering youll do throughout the games eight chapters. It certainly doesnt mesh with the new Steel on Bone close-up kills or the constant cutting down of screaming soldiers begging for their lives after theyve already been incapacitated.The combat has certainly seen some changes, as youll start off only being able to perform a handful of very basic combos, which feels pretty restrictive from the start. The multi-weapon system of the previous game is gone as well, focusing strictly on sword use here, but your sword will see a small number of upgrades throughout. As your sword becomes upgraded youll gain access to new combos and more traditional move sets, like the Flying Swallow and Izuna Drop, so its not until past the halfway point that the game even begins to feel like a more traditional Ninja Gaiden experience. Even then the combat feels off, with annoying recovery frames now present after the most simplest of combos are executed, making you far more vulnerable, and causing you to slide away after almost every move you execute.There are also some oddities in the auto-lock system, which causes you to tear away from the opponent you want to fight to focus on another nearby opponent, even when youre pressing in the direction of the guy youre trying to kill. Its like the Arkham City fist-fighting system gone wrong, and it makes it annoyingly difficult to do what you want. On the flip side of that, the game becomes easier due to the auto-pilot feel of the controls and targeting system, so much so that this is the first game in the series thats almost been a breeze to complete on the normal default difficulty. I guess thats mission accomplished when it comes to making it accessible, but if previous players werent willing to devote the time to fantastic combat before, why bother learning this dumbed down version of the game now?The stage design goes even further down the linear path introduced with Ninja Gaiden 2, leaving no room for exploration. Also, items have been completely excised from the game; youll automatically recover health after you clear a particular area with enemies, only to advance into another section to take on a few waves again and again. What little there is of each stage isnt particularly exciting either, filled with generic looking jungles, deserts, and snow covered arctic bases. The only interesting stages are the last two levels, but even those pale in comparison to the original Ninja Gaiden, and much of Ninja Gaiden 2.The multiple Ninpo system is gone too, replaced by a single Ninpo spell that summons a fiery dragon, which acts as a screen clearing attack that also boosts your health. Ninpo fills after every kill, and its clear that the game is designed to focus on you killing a handful of enemies, clearing everyone using Ninpo, and doing the same thing over again. Theres even a secondary move involving Ryus cursed arm, where it will start to glow, meaning you can trigger an attack that will auto-kill three to five enemies as well. When I said that the game has become a whole lot easier, I definitely wasnt kidding.Besides the short and uninspiring single player campaign, the series introduces some online play for the first time. One section involves Ninja Trails, which involves clearing waves of enemies across various stages and difficulties, allowing you to co-op with another player if you want. Theres an experience system in place to level up both your Ninja and chosen weapon, and honestly, its the best part of the game, because it cuts out all of the fluff from the campaign. Theres also an online vs. mode which I couldnt play, because there was never any open lobbies online, and apparently no-one around to join the multiple lobbies I attempted to create.", "date": "March 29, 2012", "grade": "C-"}
