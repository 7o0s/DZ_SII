{"name": "The Entropy Centre", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/12/the-entropy-centre-review-for-playstation-xbox-pc/", "text": "Maybe Im just becoming too jaded and cynical, but Im finding it harder and harder to get excited for first-person puzzlers. Im sure the developers mean well, but every single one Ive played in the last little while just feels like some variation of Portal, whether its Portal in Egypt, Portal in space, or, in the case of The Entropy Centre, Portal in some kind of abandoned test facility.Which, come to think of it, is Portal.To be fair to The Entropy Centre, its not a total copy. Yes, youre in some facility thats clearly seen better days, and yes, you have a gun with some crazy powers, and yes, you need to flip switches to proceed from one room to the next, and yes, youre accompanied by a cheeky AI, butuhits got a different name?Seriously, though, while the Entropy Centre is clearly very similar, its got a slightly different mechanic. While youre expected to open doors by solving puzzles, in this case you have a gun that can rewind an objects movement. That means that if you have one block but two plates on which to place it  say, one to move a platform, another to open a door  you place it on one, move to it the other, and then rewind time in a way that allows you to cross the platform and get to the door. It requires some pretty inventive thinking from time to time.The problem is, it doesnt always feel like theres a lot of variety. While none of the rooms are identical, theres also not such a huge variation between them that you feel like The Entropy Centre is constantly evolving. Even when the game starts throwing enemies at you, having a gun that literally reverses time ensures they never get that close to you. As for the environment and the sidekick, neither are so memorable that they give The Entropy Centre its own distinctive personality. Like the story  about being humanitys last hope in a moon base  all of it is enough to avoid the game from being just a reskin of Portal, but not enough to set it apart on its own. Of course, if you just want more Portal, that might make The Entropy Centre enough for you. Its not much more than that, but it also sticks so closely to the formula that it doesnt do anything crazy that would make you dislike the game, either. Its a well-worn path at this point, and The Entropy Centre never once strays from it.", "date": "December 20, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
