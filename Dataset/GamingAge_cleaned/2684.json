I mean, its a game where youre left all alone in the Amazon, with nothing but a few amenities to help you survive. Pretty much everything is trying to kill you. If thats not the definition of a survival game, I dont know what is  and yet, I didnt dislike it.Mind you, this may have been because after I died a bunch, I played the game on Tourist mode, which removes all the danger and pretty much goes against everything the game stands for. But still, speaking as someone who usually finds these games inaccessibly difficult, I appreciated that Green Hell can also be played as a no-stakes camping sim.Of course, for all the non-wimps out there, theres a lot in Green Hell to enjoy as well. It doesnt hold your hand very much, so even when it explicitly tells you what to do, its still on you to figure it out, for the most part. I mean, even when it tells you to build a fire, it still only gives you rough instructions, rather than systematically walking you through each step. And, obviously, the game only gets tougher from there. You need to craft your supplies, find food, and build shelter, all while everything wants to kill you. As long as you arent playing on the easiest modes, its going to challenge you.Which, for fans of survival games, is pretty much all you can ask for. Green Hell isnt for the faint of heart (unless you want it to be!), but it youre after a game thatll put you through your paces, itll do the trick.", "date": "April 14, 2021", "grade": "B"}
