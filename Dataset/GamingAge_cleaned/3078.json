I know that puts me in a minority  particularly around these parts  but theyre just not my thing. I dont play games to be constantly challenged, and, obviously, thats pretty much the whole point of those games.Id like to say that Ashen changed my mind about the genre, butwell, that would be a lie. In fact, if anything, I found even less to like here than in, say, Dark Souls or Demons Souls. Where those games made you feel like you were constantly engaged in epic battles with big, scary monsters, here youre generally fighting faceless, nondescript enemies. They vary a little here and there, but none of them are all that memorable.The games design also, arguably, works against it. Ashen takes place in an open-world that seems rather sizeable. While its kind of neat to have to explore a world with not much idea of what lurks around the corner, at the same time it felt like the structure of Soulsborne games  where you push through an area, figure out where to pick and fight your battles, and move on  works better in more limited spaces. The save points are also pretty infrequent here, so the end result is that you wander around for awhile, then get killed and lose all your stuff, and you have to wander around even more just to get back to where you started.On top of this, theres a co-op aspect to Ashen that seems geared towards online play  which, Ill confess, is something I dont have on the Switch. Without that, youre stuck with an AI companion who seldom does much to help you, which really takes away from one of the games big drawing points, which is supposed to be  and I quote  a massive open world, akin to the passive multiplayer of Journey. Maybe it all works better if you have Nintendo Switch Online, but if you dont, then I suspect that, like me, youll feel like youre missing something important.I also felt like I was missing something important when it came to the combat. On the one hand, Ill point you back to what I said up top: Im not big on the challenge of Soulsborne games, in large part because the combat is something I just dont have the patience for. Seeing as Ashen draws very heavily from that tradition, it should go without saying Im lousy at it. But, at the same time, Ashens combat just feels really shaky. You have to be constantly mindful of your stamina metre, and youre mostly swinging wildly at enemies, hoping your weapons are headed in their general direction. Theres no feeling of control or precision, which makes the high challenge level seem a little unfair (but, again, that could just be me).Ashen isnt entirely without its charms, mind you. As much as I complain about the interchangeable enemies, the design here is really quite gorgeous. Theres a cold, sparse feeling running through the game, and its reinforced constantly by how smooth and featureless everything looks. Im doing a lousy job of describing the games aesthetic, I know, which is a shame, because its the one part of it that I actually quite liked.", "date": "February 6, 2020", "grade": "B"}
