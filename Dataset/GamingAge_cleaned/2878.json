{"name": "Tangle Tower", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/09/tangle-tower-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Maybe its just because of the specific point & click adventure games Ive played in the last couple of months, but it feels to me like the genre is stuck reliving the early to mid-90s on an endless loop. Thats not the worst thing in the world, to be sure  the games from that era were pretty fun, and aping them has led to some decent results  but it doesnt make for games that feel particularly fresh.This is what makes Tangle Tower so surprising. It feels modern. It takes all the usual pieces of those 30-year-old games  the snarky comments and offhand jokes, the clicking on everything to find clues, the puzzles that dont always make a tonne of sense  and finds a way to make them seem fresh and new.A big part of the credit for that, I think, has to go to the games visuals. Tangle Towers aesthetic is hard to describe, but its clearly not indebted to the old LucasArts games in the way that other modern adventure games are. The colours, the style, the way its all presented  all of it feels like something that would come out today, rather than something thats trying to recreate 1994.The rest of Tangle Tower may loosely follow what youd expect from an adventure game, but all of it is so well done, it feels timeless, rather than being hopelessly indebted to the past. Take, for example, the writing and the voice acting. The two main characters, detectives Grimoire and Sally, banter constantly throughout the game, and theyre voiced by actors who give the characterswell, character. This is emblematic of the entire game, since whenever Grimoire and Sally have to interview a suspect  this is a murder mystery, after all  the people they encounter also come alive thanks to a good script and, again, good voice acting.The puzzles are another huge plus in the games favour. They generally make a lot of sense within the context of the game, rather than seeming to come out of nowhere, and they strike the right balance of being challenging without stopping the action dead.", "date": "September 14, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
