It calls itself a psychedelic puzzle game, but I dont think that description even begins to fully capture the weirdness that is this game.Take this description of the game that comes from the developers: Challenge your mind in a psychedelic journey of puzzles and meaningful encounters with Time, Poetry, Memory, Technology, War and Fatality.All of those things arebeings (?) that you meet at some point during your time with Infini. There are dogs and fish and people with guns for heads. The game is, I think, trying to make some kind of deeper philosophical point.Also, you basically spend the entire game falling down the screen. Just falling down and down and down. You hit the bottom of the screen, and re-emerge at the top. Your goal is to reach an exit, which takes you to the next screen, where again you fall down and down and down. You can speed up, and slow down, and move off the side of the screen, and avoid falling into walls or fish that make the screen go all wonky.I dont know. Its weird.Its also really ugly. In some respects, Infini kind of reminds me of Terry Gilliams Monty Python cartoons, only crossed with visuals that look less classical and more modern. Everything looks like a grotesque pastiche, and the busier the screen gets the weirder it gets  which is saying something, because it starts out pretty darn weird.Admittedly, if you strip away the weird visuals and the philosophical concepts, youre left with a pretty straightforward puzzle game. So its quite possible  probable, even  that Im allowing Infinis aesthetics to distract me from whats really only a series of weird-looking spatial logic puzzles. Then again, heres Infinis launch trailer. Trying to frame it as only a puzzle game does it a pretty big disservice.As I said up top, I dont know what to make of it. For better and for worse (and I honestly dont know where I fall on it, apart from being creeped out by the art), Infini is aunique puzzle game. If you like weird, youll like it.", "date": "July 2, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
