{"name": "SEASON: A Letter to the Future", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/02/season-a-letter-to-the-future-review-for-playstation-pc/", "text": "If ever there was a game that took the idea of its not the destination, its the journey literally, its SEASON: A letter to the future. After all, even though its a game thats about the end of the world, the impending apocalypse isnt the point. Rather, its the people you meet  and the photos you take, and the sounds you record  along the way. Consequently, its hard to judge Season on how well it tells its story, or how interesting that story is. After all, if the point is to make you stop and think about the world around you, on some level it kind of misses that point if youre focusing on something as mundane as a plot and a linear narrative, right?The thing is, the line between deeply profound and empty drivel can be awfully thin, and its hard not to feel like Season veers well into the latter half of that divide. Characters earnestly spout lines like Artists make terrible kings, and I feel a dulcet tension in the air, and Internationalism was breaking down as if theyre imparting profound truths  only none of it ever really means anything. It feels like these characters are just saying words and phrases that could caption pseudo-deep Instagram posts, and then hoping nobody notices how shallow it all is.(Ill also pause here and say that Seasons dialogue isnt helped by the fact that conversations with other people are deeply weird. Even though all the lines are fully voiced, no ones mouth moves, and the characters just move their heads around. Its as if the developers couldnt figure out how to animate lips, but theyd already recorded all the dialogue, so they just mashed it together anyway and hoped people would ascribe it to the games artistry.)The fact that scrapbooking is one of the games core mechanics also contributes to the feeling that youre playing the gaming equivalent of a teenagers philosophical Instagram account. Your character, the 20-year-old Estelle, has been tasked by her village with recording the true state of all things (did I mention the pseudo-profundity?) before the world ends, and she does so by taking artsy photos of trees and people, and occasionally recording sounds that she finds, like frogs croaking and flags ripping in the breeze. While this may fit in with the broader theme of living in the moment and enjoying the journey, much like the dialogue, it all feels too inconsequential.What I found most annoying about Season, though, was the cycling. As someone who bikes constantly, thats actually what attracted me to this game more than anything else. And while it certainly provides some of the games best moments, like when youre coasting down a hill with the wind swooping around you, cycling also leads to some of the games more frustrating moments, like when your bike can get stuck on the smallest impediment. The fact that one of the options in the pause menu is Unstuck suggests that the developers were aware of this flaw as well. But if were tallying up Seasons problems, again, by far the biggest is that its a shallow game that desperately wants you to think its deeper than it is. It has some pretty visuals and solid voice acting, but at the end of the day, theres really not much more here than trying to give historical import to snapping that perfect Instagram moment.", "date": "February 17, 2023", "grade": "C+"}
