{"name": "Superfrog HD", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/08/superfrog-hd-review-ps-vita-psn/", "text": "Seeing as my early 90s gaming was limited to whatever I could rent for my NES (I was a relatively late SNES adopter), and I  or, more accurately, my family  didnt even have a computer with a graphics card until well into the latter half of the decade, I dont have anything in the way of nostalgic love for the original Superfrog. I went into its HD remake with only an eye to how the game looks now, on the Vita, rather than any experience I may have had playing it on an Amiga. And my takeaway?Pretty much the same as what people thought about the original twenty years ago: that its a decently-done Sonic clone with some bright visuals and a bit of personality. Thats simplifying my feelings a bit, of course, but if you want the gist of it, there it is.Actually, the longer version isnt too far off from that either. Superfrog HD is a little bit Sonic (particularly when the titular character revs up and starts going fast), but also a little bit Little Big Planet  the jumps are pretty floaty, and if youve ever complained about Sackboys controls being finicky, youre probably going to go crazy playing this game. While its not like Superfrog HD is a game that requires impeccable timing or anything (the only thing that means insta-death is when you fall on spikes, and those are generally easy to avoid), it can be a little frustrating when youre trying to grab one last coin or to avoid one baddie or another.Rounding it all out, though, are a few things that dont seem to have any precedents or antecedents. The level layout, for example; as linear platformers go, Superfrog HD gives you quite a bit of room to explore. Youre never pushed in one direction or another, and  for better or worse  youre mostly left to your own devices to find out where levels end. While Im sure Im forgetting something else here, I cant think of any other platformers that give you that kind of freedom. On a slightly less unique note, theres oodles and oodles of power-ups and treasures to find. The only game I can think of that comes close to Superfrog HD in this regard is New Super Mario Bros. 2 and its million coin gimmick, but even then, not even NSMB2 has the same variety of stuff.Do those things add up to make Superfrog HD a must-play experience? Probably not. More room to look around and more things to find are nice little changes from the norm, but I wouldnt go so far as to say they give the game much in the way of a distinctive personality. For the most part, theres nothing you can find here that you couldnt also get from other decent platformers.", "date": "August 23, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
