{"name": "Shantae: Half-Genie Hero", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/08/shantae-half-genie-hero-review-switch-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "I have a sneaking suspicion that getting the most out of Shantae: Half-Genie Hero requires a very specific kind of nostalgia: you need to have played at least one of its predecessors. Bonus points if that predecessor is 2013s Shantae and the Pirates Curse, though I imagine that either of the other, much older Shantae games will do.At least, thats the conclusion I have to draw when I see how universally-beloved Half-Genie Hero is. I look at some of those reactions, and I compare it to my own, and Im left feeling as though Im missing something.Dont get me wrong: Half-Genie Hero isnt a bad game, by any stretch. As platformers go, its got quite a bit going for it. The worlds are big and varied, the hub does a good job of adding a story (while also being easy to navigate), and the bright visuals give the game a nice bit of flair.But while all of those things are definitely positives, I have a hard time saying that they make Half-Genie Hero a must-have over the likes of, say, Shu. In fact, because Half-Genie Hero has a healthy dose of Metroidvania embedded in its DNA, its actually arguably more annoying than your standard platformer, since it occasionally demands that you go back and replay levels in order for you to progress. Thats not inherently a negative, to be sure, but its still a tiny bit frustrating when a game telegraphs its intentions of unlocking skills and abilities as blatantly as is the case here  particularly once you go back and realize that the areas being unlocked arent all that interesting.", "date": "August 4, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
