{"name": "Tales from the Borderlands Escape Plan Bravo", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/tales-from-the-borderlands-escape-plan-bravo-review-for-pc-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Escape Plan Bravo marks the fourth entry in Telltales Tales from the Borderlands series. Rhys and company are tasked with what essentially ends up being a heist, putting them deep into Hyperion territory. Of course, getting off of Pandora isnt exactly the easiest thing in the world, not when new villain Mallory and her cronies are watching every move made by Rhys, Fiona, and Sasha. This episode is sort of split between two different locales, ending in what could be a pretty significant event for the Borderlands universe as a whole.While theres still other unresolved issues to iron out, like Athenas capture from last episode, and where exactly Vaughn ran off to, I still think this episode does a pretty solid job of kicking things into high gear for the tail end of this series. The final moment of this episode, not to be spoiled here, will definitely be the highlight for most. But theres plenty of other standout moments, including one remarkably touching sacrifice that does a great job of mixing humor and sorrow in a way that feels meaningful for fans of Borderlands in general.Theres also a much needed confirmation on where one characters allegiance stands, which pays off in a pretty satisfying response from Rhys regardless of the options presented. And getting to see the inner workings of Hyperion to some degree is great, as well as a weird and over-the-top shoot out thats elaborately staged while still fitting the general humor of Borderlands quite well.", "date": "August 18, 2015", "grade": "A"}
