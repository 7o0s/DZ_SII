It started with a clone (albeit a very good clone), but since then Ive found myself not just giving Pokmon games a chance, but also really enjoying them.With that in mind, I was pretty interested in playing Monster Harvest. After all, its big thing is that its a cross between a monster-breeding game and a farming sim  which, itself, is another genre Ive occasionally been able to get into. The idea of being able to grow plants and turn them into pet monsters is an intriguing one, so I was keen to see how it all turned out.The short answer: nowhere near as good as youd hope.In fairness, the farming part of the game isnt bad. Its nothing special, and certainly nothing unique, but its at least okay for what it is. You clear the land, you sow your seeds, you water them, you go to bed every night when you exhaust your stamina, and then you repeat the next day. You can also talk to fellow villagers if you want, though none of them offer anything in the way of compelling conversation. All in all, even if its nowhere near as zen as, say, Farming Simulator, Monster Harvest is still okay as a, uh, farming simulator.Where things fall apart is when we get to the Monster part of the equation. For one thing, your monsters arent that interesting, and there arent very many  only 72 in total, so you tend to see the same generic-looking blobs over and over again. Whats more, they only have a few, very limited attacks, which means that whenever you encounter another monster during your dungeon-crawling, youre seeing the same basic animations over and over again in a dull war of attrition.Theres also the problem of training your monsters. Even when they unlock more powers, were still only talking three attacks per monster, so its not like theres some huge variety. Further, leveling up is kind of useless, since it doesnt refresh your monsters health  and since, as I said, every battle is a slow war of attrition, all that means is that you have to go back and rest up regularly, rather than allowing your monsters to get more powerful and healthier the further into a dungeon they get.Its a shame that the execution is so bad, since, as I said, theres a good idea at the core of Monster Harvest. Given that there are plenty of very good monster-breeding games and farming sims out there  even if not necessarily in the same game  youre much better off playing those in tandem rather than suffering through this.", "date": "February 7, 2022", "grade": "C-"}
