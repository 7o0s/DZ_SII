{"name": "Knights & Guns", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/11/knights-guns-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Knights & Guns is, in its own weird way, a shmup  just not in the way youre probably thinking.I realize thats kind of an odd way to classify a game, but its fair in this case. See, in Knights & Guns, playing as an eponymous knight (armed with a gun, obviously), you run back and forth across the bottom of a static screen, shooting upwards. And thats the entire game, across 150 levels.Of course, when people think shmups  or, at least, when I think of shmups  they think vertical- or horizontal-scrolling shooters, where youre shooting down enemies coming at you from all directions. Knights & Guns doesnt have that  but it does have a pretty frenetic pace, that requires lots and lots of shooting.Unfortunately, it doesnt really require much else. Right when you start playing the game it advises you that its better played with a friend, so maybe I missed out on something crucial by playing it solo, but it didnt take too long until the levels all started feeling same-y.In Knights & Guns defense, the game does a very good job of keeping your knight well-armed. There are 30+ guns to be found here, and theyre different enough from each other that even if the gist of the game doesnt change  again, just shoot up, constantly, and wait for the enemy monsters to bounce above you  at the very least, you get to see a bit of variety in how the weapons fire.Ill also add that Knights & Guns looks pretty stellar. Each of the levels is vividly coloured, popping off the screen with an impressive amount of detail  though, truthfully, its very easy to overlook given youre spending most of your time here racing back and forth.All things considered, Knights & Guns feels like it wouldve been an amazing game to play, say, thirty years ago in an arcade  someplace where the action wouldnt feel quite as repetitive, and where youd be able to enjoy its fiery action in all its loud, brightly coloured glory. As it stands, it probably doesnt do enough to stand out among the many shmups that call the Switch home  whether its a slight variation on the usual or not.", "date": "November 5, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
