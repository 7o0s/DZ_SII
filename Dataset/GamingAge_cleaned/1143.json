{"name": "Saturday Morning RPG", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/04/saturday-morning-rpg-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "One game kept coming to mind again and again as I played Saturday Morning RPG: Retro City Rampage.While the two titles may not have that much in common in terms of gameplay  the latter is an action-packed parody of early top-down GTA games, whereas Saturday Morning RPG is a fairly straightforward RPG that just happens to have a genre atypical setting  theres no denying that the same spirit runs through both. Like RCR, Saturday Morning RPG is chock-full of 80s references. You cant take more than a few steps here without running into something that, somehow, plays off the pop culture of that decade. The main character is named Marty Michael Hall (so nods to Back to the Future AND Anthony Michael Hall, all in one shot). Your main enemy, HOOD, is a thinly-veiled take-off on GI Joes COBRA. The Wizard and the NES Power Glove play a major role in one of the episodes. Care Bears, Transformers, Karate Kid, Trapper Keepersbasically, if you can remember some piece of 80s kid culture detritus, it probably pops up here in some form or another.Unfortunately, thats where the comparisons with Retro City Rampage end. See, where that game hid a pretty addictive game beneath its nostalgic exterior, Saturday Morning RPGs nostalgia just hides more nostalgia. After awhile  probably around the hundredth time you attack someone with a Moonwalk  you start to wish that the developers had a little more to say that Hey, remember this thing from thirty years ago? Us too! Its the Family Guy approach to humour, where references to things stand in place of actual jokes, and it works nearly as well here as it does there.Okay, that was a low blow. Perhaps a better analogy would be a Russian nesting doll, since no matter how far down you go in Saturday Morning RPG, youre just left with more and more of the same. I mean, yes, the setting is fairly novel for an RPG, but thats where the innovation ends: the plot isnt particularly engaging or memorable, the battles start feeling repetitive very quickly, and the world youre exploring is kind of empty. On the plus side, I guess the game gets points for being relatively short, but thats not enough to make it worth your while.", "date": "April 18, 2016", "grade": "C"}
