{"name": "Game of Thrones", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/05/game-of-thrones-review-for-xbox-360-ps3-pc/", "text": "When you approach a group of enemies, youll enter a battle state, which allows you to queue up to three commands at a time. You can open a radial menu, which slows down time but doesnt stop it, to choose from a series of skills to queue up. Certain skills work well together, like first sweeping an enemys feet and then landing a downward strike for increased damage, and exploiting that system is key to making combat work.I actually had some issue with the game early on, as I found combat to be ridiculously difficult on the normal difficulty setting, until I realized my mistake. I had poured my scant few skill points into skills that were passive in nature, like increased critical rates, hit percentage and so on. But had neglected skills that actually performed actions, like the all too important abilities that allow you to interrupt opponents special attacks. I found it a bit odd that the game didnt really push me to unlock these skills, and a little more guidance in the early portion of my character building would have went a long way in making the game less frustrating early on.As you start to unlock additional skills, including Alester and Mors secondary abilities, the combat system really becomes more strategic than I originally gave it credit for. It can get a bit boring when youre only facing off against a couple opponents, but things start to pick up in larger fights with four or more foes, and these encounters can lead to a number of nail-biting, tense scenarios thatll see you just scraping by.World exploration in Game of Thrones is limited to around ten or so important locations, but those locations can range in scope from small areas like Castle Black, to the more involved sections like Castlewood or Kings Landing. For the most part the main quest will funnel you to new locations fairly often, but the last third of the game does involve backtracking through a lot of familiar ground.There are optional side quests to tackle in each chapter, some of which can be revisited for completion in later chapters. Side quests are actually interesting in Game of Thrones, and thankfully involve more than just going around and killing a certain number of foes or fetching materials for random townfolk. Youll investigate murders, recruit for the Nights Watch, and a whole lot more if youre willing to seek out the optional material.Besides questing you can explore every nook and cranny for loot, but the quality of said loot isnt generally worth the effort. I feel like equipment in Game of Thrones is underutilized, and the currency/monetary system is poorly implemented as well. In the first half of the game, even with doing a fair bit of searching and side questing, youll feel remarkably poor compared to the asking cost of items in most shops youll encounter. However, in the second half when you can actually start to afford the overpriced gear, a lot of the equipment you get from completing quests ends up being better or just as good as what you can finally buy. And theres no new game plus option that allows you to carry over your surplus cash into a new game, so most of the shop selections are pretty pointless outside of the much needed potion vendor.Also worth noting is that this is a story-centric experience, filled to the brim with cutscenes and dialogue. Seriously, the amount of talking compared to the amount of action would give previously notorious titles like Metal Gear Solid 4 a run for their money. However, if you have an interest in the world of Westeros coming in, youll eventually find yourself pretty enamored with the overall plot. The dialogue and writing never quite match the level of prose featured in the novels, but the overall story is still pretty engaging and interesting. Its also rife with the expected twists, turns, and general maliciousness that weve come to expect from this particular universe. It really, really pays off in later chapters, and ends up elevating an otherwise hum-drum gameplay experience into something a bit more interesting overall.Still, I cant quite say that you should rush out and pick this up, but its certainly worth a play through, whether thats from a rental or price drop or some other future discount. Its a fairly lengthy experience, so youll definitely get your moneys worth if thats a concern, but it would have been nice to see the universe get a slightly better treatment than this entry. Its a fairly ugly looking game, which benefits it a bit in that Westeros is a somewhat ugly place at times, but that ugliness comes from poor textures and character models and less so from intended art design.", "date": "May 21, 2012", "grade": "C+"}
