{"name": "Dino Galaxy Tennis", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/04/dino-galaxy-tennis-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Even if it doesnt look retro, theres something distinctly old-school about Dino Galaxy Tennis. Its basic premise  as you can guess from the title, dinosaurs playing tennis in outer space  seems like the sort of thing that youd have seen way back in the day, back when it often felt like games were throwing whatever random scenario they could think up just to see if it worked.And does it work here? For the most part, yes. Its not the most content-filled game, with only 6 levels in the story mode, but it gets challenging enough near the end that youre sure to be replaying those last few levels several times before you finally beat them. Theres also a multiplayer mode, in case you have a few friends and want to try your hand at dino space tennis.Mind you, I dont think Dino Galaxy Tennis would be my first choice if I was looking for a party game. For one thing, the controls can be a bit finicky  though this may be because my brain would every so often forget I was trying to run up and down, rather than side to side, and Id uselessly be pushing my dino to the right when he really just had to run down.Likewise, the ball physics are just wonky enough that they can occasionally be frustrating. Not only is it pretty challenging to aim your shots outside of a power-up, its not always clear what counts as a point against you. Your dino is charged with protecting his planet from the opponents serves  with you losing the point if it hits  except sometimes the ball will pass through a planet on a ricochet, with no resulting loss in points.Overall, though, its not hard to overlook those minor flaws for the few hours itll take to play through the game. Dino Galaxy Tennis isnt a great tennis game, but its a fun one, and thats really all that matters.", "date": "April 25, 2022", "grade": "B"}
