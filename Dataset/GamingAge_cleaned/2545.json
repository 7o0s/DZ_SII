Its basically just Dots and Boxes, with a few minor tweaks here and there to make it more complex.Im not going to pretend Mind Maze is anything incredible. Its pretty basic, and even if it tweaks the games formula a little it doesnt do anything really noteworthy. But, at the same time, I dont want to discount that too much  the worst game Ive played this year, after all, was another Vita version of Dots and Boxes that was absolutely terrible in every way imaginable. So theres something to be said for being functional.Further, because its so basic, its actually kind of addictive. The game on which its based has been around for more than a century, and Mind Mazes developers were smart enough to not get in their own way by making things more complicated. The tweaks I mentioned above are only things like changing the shape of the board, or adding a mode where you can take on multiple AI opponents, neither of which change the goal of the game in any noticeable way.Literally the only complaint I have is that the Vita version of the game doesnt have touch controls, which means that you sometimes need to fiddle around with your cursor before you can place your line exactly where you want it. As complaints go, thats nothing.Again, I wouldnt say that Mind Maze is some brilliant puzzle game, or even a crazy new take on a durable genre. Its as basic as they come. But it works, and its addictive, and thats really all it needs to be.", "date": "September 20, 2021", "grade": "B"}
