{"name": "Monster Monpiece", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/06/monster-monpiece-review-ps-vita/", "text": "To the extent I knew of Monster Monpiece prior to playing it, it was from stories with headlines describing it as the Vitas most inappropriate game. Or from the fact that Idea Factory was holding back parts of the game from North American release for being too sexually suggestive. Or, even more succinctly, I knew it from this GIF, in whichlets be blunt, since theres no way to state it other than the obvious: you basically masturbate your Vita. Based on that alone, I was anticipating a game that was ultra-pervy even by Japanese standards.You can imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Monster Monpiece is a whole lot more than just vigourously rubbing pictures of schoolgirls. Its a shockingly addictive card-battle game, where you have to traverse a world infested with monsters, matching your deck against those of your enemies in a quest to prevent the evil Lost from taking over. Not only that, its one that doesnt try and hide how addictive it is beneath layers upon layers of arcane rules  always a good thing if youre a newcomer to the genre (like me), even moreso when you consider that this game in particular isnt that good at explaining everything (which is ironic, because every time something new gets introduced, its alongside pages and pages of text).Even more surprisingly, its got female characters whose relationships get a decent amount of fleshing out (pun not intended), and who arent defined by how jiggly they are or how little clothing they wear (in contrast to, say, Conception II, which fully embraced the fact it was a game all about teenagers getting it on). I wouldnt say that Monster Monpiece is an outstanding example of female characterization in gaming, but at the same time, none of the females here are damsels in distress, and that seems like it should count for something.Of course, no amount of great characters can make up for the fact that the games titular monsters all look just like prepubescent girls (albeit ones who are absurdly well endowed). You rarely see those monster girls up close, but even from a distance, looking at the on cards, its not hard to feel a little weirded out. And, of course, theres the fact that to level up your cards involves that aforementioned rubbing. Its official name is First Crush Rub, and its every bit as unsettling as it sounds: you rub around each girl/monsters body, trying to find the spots she likes the most, and when you hit on the right spots for long enough you send her into ecstasy, which you sustain by rubbing your Vita, front and back, up and down as quickly as you can.", "date": "June 3, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
