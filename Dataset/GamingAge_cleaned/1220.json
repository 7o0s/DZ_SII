The graphics are blocky. The missions are repetitive. The voice acting is atrocious. The controls can occasionally go a little wonky. The plot is nonsensical. You could pick pretty much any measure, and I can almost guarantee you that EDF 2 will fail at it.Needless to say, I love it.And not just in spite of its flaws, either. No, I love EDF 2 precisely for the reasons that many people may find it lacking. Take the graphics: are they ugly? Sure. Do buildings shatter in an oddly symmetrical way? Absolutely. Do trees explode the same way buildings do? Bizarrely, yes. But nitpicking those things is missing the core objective of both the game and the series. Youre blowing up giant bugs and alien spaceships (from, er, Planet Space, according to the games title) inside destructible cities! As far as Im concerned, the fact you can tell the difference between an exploding tree, an exploding house and an exploding skyscraper is more than enough. The fact you can do so on the Vitas smaller screen with little difference from the games console versions is practically a miracle.Not only that, expecting EDF 2 to be a graphical powerhouse is to ignore the games purpose. Near as Ive ever been able to tell, the whole series aims to recreate the feel of cheesy Cold War-era sci-fi films. It does that splendidly, which is why Im so willing to overlook the awful voice acting and the tin-eared dialogue. I absolutely love movies like Them!, The Day The Earth Stood Still and, obviously, Godzilla (not to mention the MST3K takedowns of their less-than-stellar peers), and I like them for precisely the same reason I love this game: no matter the problems, theyre still undeniably fun.", "date": "January 7, 2016", "grade": "A-"}
