{"name": "Megaton Rainfall", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/01/megaton-rainfall-review-ps4-pc/", "text": "On a purely conceptual level, Megaton Rainfall is amazing. Its basically the Superman game weve never had, a first-person superhero game where you fly around the world saving cities and civilians from aliens and robots. Its the sort of thing that lots of people (myself included) have been craving for a long time, so its awesome to see a developer step up to the plate to try their hand at it  particularly when you consider that theyre an indie studio who, presumably, dont have the kind of budget youd think a larger developer with access to actual superhero IPs might bring to the table.The good news is that Pentadimensional have not only come up with a concept, they also, by and large, deliver on it. Even playing the game on a regular PS4  that is, not with a PSVR  flying was amazing. It felt amazing to soar over oceans and mountains, to rocket into space, and to dive into the sea. I honestly cant recall a game that makes you feel like youre flying as well as Megaton Rainfall does.Likewise, it really delivers on giving you godlike powers. You can shoot energy blasts from your hands to vaporize enemies, andwell, its pretty cool. I mean, I could try to wax poetic about it, but the truth is, zapping spaceships is just plain fun, the kind that you dont need to justify or think all that deeply about. It just works, and works really well.Best of all, Megaton Rainfall actually gives your actions moral weight. It bestows all these incredible powers on your character, and then follows through on the great responsibility part of the famous Spider-man quote. Every time one of your blasts misses an enemy and goes crashing through a building, little text pops up on screen and tells you how many people you just killed. If too many people die, you fail, and have to start over again from the previous checkpoint. It may not sound like much, but its the sort of thing most superhero-related media  not just games, but comics and movies too  completely overlook.The problem, of course, is that weighing civilian lives and moral calculations into your actions is actually kind of a drag. I know thats the point of the game, but it doesnt make it any less frustrating when you vaporize a spaceship thats trying to blow up a city block, only to realize too late that youve overdone it and actually vaporized the entire city in the process. Like, its a valuable life/game lesson, to be sure, but it also makes it apparent why more games/media dont spend too much time focusing on those issues.I dont want to fault the game too much for doing it, though. Megaton Rainfall is the kind of superhero game Ive always wanted to play, and even if its not perfect, its still an interesting step in the right direction for the genre as a whole.", "date": "January 11, 2018", "grade": "B"}
