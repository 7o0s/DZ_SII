While this may not have been the experience the games creators had in mind when they created it, Im pleased to report that its every bit as playable  and as fun  when you play on your own as it is when you play as part of a team.Admittedly, it also makes Keep Talking a little easier. After all, the way the game is designed, playing in pairs makes it tougher. One player sees the bomb on his or her screen, while their partner reads the bomb disposal guide that the developers offer on their site. The diffuser then tells the reader whats on the bomb, and the reader searches the guide to tell them what steps to take to diffuse the bomb. By playing solo, you cut out the middle step, and just search the guide yourself, which removes some of the confusion thats almost inevitable when two people are trying to describe things.That said, the beauty of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is that, intentionally or not, it works either way. Even if it gets slightly easier playing it by yourself, that doesnt reduce the tension thats inherent to the timer relentlessly ticking away the minutes, drawing you closer and closer to the bomb exploding. Likewise, even if you play solo, its still very easy to make mistakes, and the buzzer that tells you youve gotten a question wrong is no less panic-inducing for one person than it is for two.Similarly, the games one drawback is there whether youre playing by yourself or with others: after awhile, all the puzzles start feeling the same. Yes, you have the option of creating your own bombs, but its not like some hidden aspect of the game reveals itself when you do that. What you get on your first bomb is what you get on your hundredth bomb, even if the difficulty level may have decreased exponentially.But in short bursts, thats not a major problem, and Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes was clearly designed for short bursts. Its an interesting, tension-filled take on puzzle games, and thats true however many people are playing it with you.", "date": "November 27, 2018", "grade": "A-"}
