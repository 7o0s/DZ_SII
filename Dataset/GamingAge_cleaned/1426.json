When they started bringing their casual phone games over to the Vita a few years ago, they were uniformly lousy. Between their ugly mahjohg games, their ugly tower defense games, and their not-ugly (but also incredibly dull) Doodle God/Devil games, they had the market cornered on lazy ports. But lately, theyve been showing every sign of learning from past mistakes and making games that are worth checking out. First Doodle Kingdom broke the mould from its predecessors and delivered an interesting matching game. Then Medieval Defenders proved itself to be solidly okay. And now theyve come out with Strike Solitaire, and I have to say: Im totally hooked.I should add one or two provisos before going any further of course. First off, its only worth getting if youre in the mood for something casual on your Vita  and I have my doubts that there exists a huge overlap in the Venn diagram of Vita owners and solitaire lovers. On top of that, it does feature DLC  things like wild Joker cards and whatnot  that make it a little easier to win, which is a little annoying seeing as were talking about a $5 card game.As far as Im concerned, however, those are two pretty minor qualifications, that dont detract from the games overall fun. Yes, you have the option of paying real money to make the game easierbut at the same time, it rewards you pretty well for matching the very cards you need to beat each level, both in terms of coins and powerups, and many of the levels are easy enough that its possible to rack up coins without even realizing youre doing it. As casual game DLC goes, its pretty inessential.As for the second point, that its a casual game on a platform that probably doesnt have many casual gamers? Meh. All I know is that Strike Solitaire scratches an itch I never knew I had: to play solitaire on my Vita.Ill emphasize, of course, that its a solitaire variant, rather than being straight-up solitaire. The Strike part of Strike Solitaire refers to bowling, which here means that each set of ten layouts is broken into frames rather than hands. You also have to match ten specific cards, and getting those cards ends the frame with a strike.", "date": "May 27, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
