{"name": "Tokyo Xanadu eX+", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/12/tokyo-xanadu-ex-plus-review-ps4-pc/", "text": "Ill be honest: if you played Tokyo Xanadu back when it came out on the Vita a few months ago, you probably dont need to pick it up now that its been repackaged and re-released on PS4 as Tokyo Xanadu eX+. Notwithstanding claims that the newer version has extra characters and missions, the fact is, this is basically the same game with just a few cosmetic tweaks.Mind you, thats not the worst thing in the world. While I may not have loved the Persona-esque social aspect of the game, Tokyo Xanadus dungeon-crawling combat was top-notch, and Ive gone back to it many times since I reviewed it back in November. It may not have made our staff-wide GOTY list, but as far as I was concerned, it was one of the best Vita games I played in 2017. If this extended version of the game on PS4 brings it to a few more appreciative players, that can only be a good thing.Not too surprisingly, what made Tokyo Xanadu a fun game is also what makes Tokyo Xanadu eX+ a fun game. The combat is smooth and free-flowing. Its easy to chain together huge combos. Theres a huge cast of characters, which means you have plenty of options for putting together parties. The enemies are challenging without being impossible, the dungeons are varied, and everything  save for the social interaction, which is still a bit of a chore  fits together perfectly.Like I said, thats not enough to make Tokyo Xanadu eX+ worth checking out if youve already played it on the Vita. But it does mean that if you never played the Vita version, and youre looking for a big game with smooth combat and a decent enough plot, then it should fit the bill.", "date": "December 28, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
