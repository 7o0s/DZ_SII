If, for example, youre playing it as a free web game (that, Ill note, has been around since 2019), then it will probably seem completely fine. I meanits free. Not only that, it works, so it feels like anything more than that is just a bonus.Now, if youre paying actual money for it  as you would be on consoles, which is how Ive first experienced it  then the value proposition is significantly diminished. It still works just fine, if were being fair, but beyond that, theres not much about it that sets it apart. Its an incredibly generic metroidvania platformer that doesnt have anything in the way of a personality.This is both surprising and disappointing, since the Sun Wukong from Chinese mythology  AKA the Monkey King  would probably make for an amazing video game character, and his story seems tailor-made for a game. Like, take a moment just to read the intro to the linked Wikipedia article: Sun Wukong is basically super-powered, with insane strength and speed, and he was imprisoned under a mountain for trying to overthrow heaven. If thats not the recipe for Chinese version of God of War, I dont know what is.Instead, in Sun Wukong VS Robot, the titular hero is ridiculously underpowered, with barely any abilities and not much in the way of a health bar. Hes on a mission to take out four robots for reasons that are never really explained or explored, and the whole game unfolds without ever once being interesting.Just about the only reason you might want to play Sun Wukong VS Robot would be if youve played literally every other metroidvania you can get your hands on, and youve reached a stage where youll play anything as long as its functional. (Even then, though, you can still play this for free.) For everyone else, you can skip this one pretty safely.", "date": "October 6, 2021", "grade": "C+"}
