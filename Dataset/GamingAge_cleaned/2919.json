{"name": "Gun Crazy", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/07/gun-crazy-review-for-ps4/", "text": "I can kind of see what Gun Crazys developer was thinking when they made the game. Its very clearly meant to be an homage to early 90s run & gun platformers with its retro graphics and gameplay thats all about racking up high scores by shooting everything in your path. Basically, think of a more frenetic version of Mega Man, and youve got a good idea of whats in store for you here.Or, at least, that was probably the idea. In practice, Gun Crazy is a game where I was able to get a Platinum in about fifteen minutes by constantly firing my gun and running to the right.Admittedly, part of the reason the Platinum is so easy is that this is a Ratalaika game, which means the Platinum pops about halfway through the actual runtime (though I will highlight that this is still a very short game regardless).The bigger part of why I finished this game so quickly, however, is that its absurdly easy. Now, keep in mind that Im not someone who values insane difficulty in my games. I didnt like tough-as-nails platformers the first time around in the 80s, and I hate that retro today is often code for game that tries to kill you as much as possible. So its not like Im bragging here. I mean it: Gun Crazy might be one of the easiest games Ive ever played. After dying in my first playthrough because I stopped to shoot everything, I decided to see what would happen if I just kept on moving forward and never took my finger off the shoulder button. The end result was, as I said, a very quick Platinum, since enemies practically run into your bullets.", "date": "July 29, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
