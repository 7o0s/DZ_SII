{"name": "God Eater 2: Rage Burst", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/god-eater-2-rage-burst-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Its pretty easy to review God Eater 2: Rage Burst, as far as Im concerned: just think of it as a slightly improved version of God Eater Resurrection. As far as Im concerned, that means it merits a slightly better grade than God Eater Resurrection. Were not talking rocket science here.I mean, looked at a certain way, you may think that this is a mark against God Eater 2. After all, GE Resurrection was itself a slightly upgraded version of a 2011 PSP game, which in turn was a somewhat stale Monster Hunter clone even when it first released. In other words, were talking about a game that essentially couldve come out a decade ago without being substantially different from what were seeing today. If youre looking for a game that revolutionizes the MonHun formula, I could see how that might be disappointing.Conversely, if youre a huge fan of the God Eater franchise, you may think that God Eater 2 takes its own formula to a new level. New monsters, new weapons, a new attack add-on called Blood Arts, even the introduction of character-specific quests: in those terms, I suppose, GE2 does bring in some new bells and whistles that help elevate it to something more than it was the last time around.As youve probably already guessed, my opinion falls squarely in the middle. I dont think God Eater 2 is a particularly innovative game, but at the same time, I think it improves on the series first game enough that theres no denying that its noticeably better. Take the graphics, for example: while this game still isnt going to win any awards for its looks, its undeniably an improvement over what previous iterations looked like. The same, too, could be said for the combat, or the controls, or the plot, or any other aspect of the game. The improvements are small and incremental, but theyre nonetheless obvious enough that theyre undeniably present.", "date": "September 26, 2016", "grade": "B+"}
