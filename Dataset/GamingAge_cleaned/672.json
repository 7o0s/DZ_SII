Specifically, I generally love when the series tries something new, and hate when it sticks to its usual JRPG formula. Seeing as Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online is outside of the mainline series, that should bode well for it, right?Turns out: no. While Cyberdimension Neptunia does seem to exist outside the main Hyperdimension Neptunia games  and, as its title hints, inside a fake MMO  that, by itself, doesnt make it any good. What made games like Producing Perfection and Hyperdevotion Noire worthwhile was that they had fun with their adopted genres. By contrast, Cyberdimension Neptunia is pretty dull.And dull goes for both the action and the plot development. The cutscenes here feature endless, cringeworthy dialogue  which, admittedly, is something that could be said for most Neptunia games, but theres just something particularly painful going on here here. Maybe the fact youre playing a game within the game adds an untenable layer of irony, but whatever the reason may be, watching the eponymous 4 Goddesses prattle on about how much they enjoy playing their MMO is painfully boring. Essentially, think of how boring it is to play Sword Art Online games and watch the characters go on about how interesting their game is, and you have a good idea of what makes Cyberdimension Neptunia insufferableonly double it, because its done with the games standard winking.Likewise, the battles here are repetitive and uninspired. Again, depending on your feelings towards the series other games, you may think thats nothing new, but here it just feels much more noticeably bland. Like in a real MMO (I guess), here you travel from world map to hub world and back, taking on the same monsters in new areas before heading home to talk with more NPCs in the town. Even if the monsters were a little more diversified, though, Id still have problems with the combat: it almost all feels so light, for lack of a better description. You may be hacking and slashing your way through groups of enemies at a time, but all your attacks feel oddly weightless. Its the kind of thing that couldve been fixed with just a bit more controller vibration (which does kick in once you get hit), and without it, it just never feels like your hacks or your slashes are properly connecting.Which, really, could be said about the whole game: it never connects. MMOs and faux-MMOs are ripe for parody, which youd think would make them ideal targets for Hyperdimension Neptunias brand of game-centric humour, but as Cyberdimension Neptunia shows, its apparently harder than it looks.", "date": "November 20, 2017", "grade": "C"}
