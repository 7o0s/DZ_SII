{"name": "TorqueL", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/torquel-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "I dont know about you, but when Im playing a platformer Im not usually thinking about the physics of how they actually work. I press the d-pad or joystick one way and my character moves in that same direction; I press a button and the person onscreen jumps. I know its all learned behaviour, and that I didnt come out of the womb knowing how to get Mario from Point A to Point B, but I passed the point long ago where I had to give it much thought.TorqueL doesnt work that way. TorqueL wants you to think about those things. In fact, thats pretty much all TorqueL asks of you: to really consider how youre getting your character from one place to another. Its not quite as demanding as a game like QWOP, but its not all that far off, either.This really shouldnt be too surprising. After all, aesthetically TorqueL is shockingly minimalistic. The characters are stick figures, the levels are made up of lots of straight lines, and the whole thing looks like it couldve come from one of gamings earliest consoles (assuming, of course, they could render a few bright colors). I guess it only makes sense that the games controls takes a back-to-basics approach as well.Or, at least, they do in the sense that you really have to think about how your character actually moves. You can roll your square along the ground a little, but if you want to move from one platform to another, if you want to jump over a fiery red pit, you need to be fully aware of your characters cardinal directions. Pressing the Vitas triangle button will always send a green bar straight above your stick figures head  which means that if your character is upside down or sideways, the green bar will be as well. It works the same with the PlayStation controllers other iconic buttons, and it never fails to be less than nerve wracking as you constantly adjust your own sense of direction on the fly.Id like to say it gets easier as the game progresses, but it really doesnt. Even setting aside the little changes in gravity and other obstacles TorqueL adds to the equation the further in your get, its just really difficult to always be mentally readjusting like that. At best, Id say I started getting really good at pressing all four of the Vitas face buttons at once, jamming me into a spot as I experimented with wiggling my character in one direction or another.", "date": "August 26, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
