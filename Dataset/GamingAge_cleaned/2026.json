{"name": "Mens Room Mayhem", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/06/mens-room-mayhem-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Depending on your point of view, you may be either disappointed or relieved to learn that Mens Room Mayhem isnt quite as lewd or salacious as its name suggests. While its certainly got some material that some people may find objectionable, its not quite the stuff of YouPorn or RedTube (or worse) that you might be expecting.That said, it does take the term scatological humor pretty literally. After all, its a Flight Control-style line-drawing game where youre directing traffic around a public washroom. Failing to get everyone through in an orderly manner leads to fistfights at best, or urine/feces if youre not so lucky. Basically, if youre of a tender, easily-offended disposition, you might want to avert your eyes.And if youre not? Well, then it all depends on your feelings towards line-drawing and traffic management, since once you get past the novelty of the subject matter, thats pretty much all there is to Mens Room Mayhem. Its basically Flight Control with men who need to pee instead of planes.Of course, in Flight Control you never had to worry about planes getting in fistfights  whereas in Mens Room Mayhem, overly aggressive AI is practically the games defining characteristic (apart, you know, from the fact its about managing the flow of traffic in a mens room). Once you get past level five or so, the issue isnt making sure everyone can do their business and leave, its making sure that they dont get close enough to see each other. Pretty much every game I played ended on account of massive brawls breaking out between people whose paths came kinda, sorta near each other on their way out of the washroom, rather than because of accidents caused by not getting everyone to stalls and urinals in time. While my traffic management skills are certainly behind some of those fights, the games AI is definitely not blameless.", "date": "June 10, 2013", "grade": "B"}
