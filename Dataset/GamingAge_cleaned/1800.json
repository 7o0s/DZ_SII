It is, without a doubt, one of the strangest, most disturbing games Ive ever played. It horrifies me that it exists. And yetI kind of like it.Actually, thats really understating things. I kind of love it. Im not sure what that says about me, but I know this: theres a lot more to Danganronpa than I was initially expecting. I mean, its a visual novel game about a bunch of archetypal students trapped in a school by a homicidal bear, who in turn expects them to kill each other off one by one  or en masse, depending on how things go. The only way it could be more stereotypically LOL Japan is if there were girls in tiny dresses being raped by tentacle monstersand, come to think of it, one of the teenage students is referred to as a Gothic Lolita, and one of the other students is overly fond of his hentai porn. (Apologies for what the preceding sentence may do for your browsers content-based ads.) So, you know: LOL Japan.But thats oversimplifying Danganronpa far, far too much. Its undoubtedly an odd game, but its also incredibly complex. It borrows from a wide range of influences, from the obvious  say, Battle Royale or the Corpse Party series, along with 999/Virtues Last Reward  to the surprising (i.e. Ace Attorney, old arcade shooters and rhythm games like Hatsune Miku or DJ Max), with an end result thats wonderfully addictive.Though wonderful is probably not the correct word to use in this case. Theres little about Danganronpa, content-wise, thats wonderful, at least in any positive, uplifting sense of the word. Its incredibly dark, and occasionally brutal. True, they dont show anything too gory (the blood here is all hot pink), but they dont need to  without giving anything away, I can tell you that the first murder scene is incredibly bloody, and it only gets worse from there.What makes it so playable, however, is the way it incorporates those surprising influences. Not only is the story engrossing, it keeps you hooked by making your characters life literally depending on you paying attention. If you want to survive, you need to not only know whats gone on, but also have the ability to recall them all, Ace Attorney-style, with the clock ticking down and your life on the line. Not only that, you have time your time your interjections so that you can literally shoot down erroneous statements, and then, to deal the damning piece of evidence, you need to be able to master a fast-paced rhythm mini-game.(Though of those three influences, the rhythm mini-games are by far the least fun. Until you figure out what youre supposed to do, in fact, they seem like a massive, pointless pain. After you figure things out, theyre merely a little annoying.)Also, apropos of nothing other than Im mentioning the things I like about Danganronpa, I have to say that the game looks fantastic. You dont usually see color palettes that combine bright pastels and even brighter neons, but thats what you get here, and its far more visually appealing than it has any right to be.", "date": "February 11, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
