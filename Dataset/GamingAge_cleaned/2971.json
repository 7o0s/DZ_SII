{"name": "Stories Untold", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/06/stories-untold-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Unless you grew up playing text adventures in the 80s  and Im not going to even pretend that I did, I was a console gamer even back then  Stories Untold probably wont be like anything youve ever played before. There are elements of it that are kind of like Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, but Stories Untold goes well beyond that into something much deeper and much darker.Now, its difficult to write about Stories Untold, because anything that goes beyond a description of the mechanics quickly gets into spoiler territory, and given that were talking about a short, narrative-focused game, it seems wrong to spoil too much. Nonetheless, if youve been attracted by the games Stranger Things-esque aesthetic, its important to know thats not really an accurate portrayal of the game, so Ill do my best to tell you what youre in for without explicitly telling you what youre in for.The game consists of four short episodes, and, for the most part, the world around you doesnt change too much. The first chapter is a straight-up text adventure, where you give commands into an old computer. The second and third chapters involve going back and forth between a pair of screens; the second chapter requires you to read a manual and then carry out experiments, while the third involves reading a manual and then inputting a series of codes, again on an old computer. You get to walk a little bit during that third chapter, and then the fourth chapter involves walking a few hallways, revisiting some of the mechanics that youve already used, and then wrapping everything up in a horrifying bow.Thats not much of a description to go on, I know, but its really everything that you do in the game. As youre sitting there  at your computer, at your manual, at your radio  the world around you will subtly (and not-so-subtly) change, adding a layer of creepiness to the proceedings, but it seldom changes what youre actually doing.As for the story  which, really, is the main point of a game like this  Im not going to pretend I was a fan. At first, Stories Untold presents itself as a creepy horror game, which was fine, if a little outside of my comfort zone. Eventually, however, you realize the horror here is more mental and emotional, and as someone who isnt particularly fond of media thats best described as gut-wrenching, I cant say I liked it all that much.I get that thats a matter of taste, though, and I wont judge anyone who enjoys stories like this. I will, though, judge anyone who thinks that the Switch is well-suited to a game that involves lots of typing on keyboards and keypads, not to mention tapping various objects. Im sure that worked well when the game originally came out on PC, but here, its a lot more cumbersome. Theoretically, the developers couldve sidestepped this problem a little by allowing you to use the touchscreen, but they dont, so thats a moot point, and instead youre left with the awkwardness of moving the cursor very slowly around the screen with your thumbsticks. On top of that, Stories Untold also requires you to read quite a bit of small text, which is a challenge when youre playing the game in handheld mode. I was able to do it, but I definitely felt a bit of eyestrain afterwards, and I imagine that most people will have that issue, regardless of how strong their eyesight is.Control issues aside, I still wouldnt say that Stories Untold is a bad game. Indeed, if you like emotionally heavy games with interesting, underutilized mechanics, youll get that here  youll just have to go in understanding that, without a mouse and keyboard, some of those mechanics dont work the best.", "date": "June 2, 2020", "grade": "B"}
