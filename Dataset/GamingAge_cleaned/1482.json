The first-person perspective, the challenging puzzles, the robotic eyes watching you, the funny British narrator  this game is totally a God of War ripoff.Just kidding! Its Portal 2, of course. I mean, there are a few minor differences here and there  most obviously, the fact that where Valves masterpiece took place at the end of the world, Pneuma takes place at the beginning of it  but were to replace this narrator with Stephen Merchant, the end result would basically be Portal 3.Im of two minds regarding such blatant thievery. On the one hand, it pretty much goes without saying that Pneuma is nowhere near as good as the game its stealing from. Theres a pretty strong argument to be made that Portal 2 is the best game of all time, so there was basically zero chance that an imitator would have any chance whatsoever of escaping such an enormous shadow.That said (and I apologize for getting a little corny here), I cant help but think of the old adage about shooting for the moon and missing. Pneuma may not come anywhere close to matching Portal 2, but because the developers aimed so high, they created a situation in which even achieving half of what they wanted to do still led to a pretty impressive game.Take the puzzles. Seeing as all youre doing in every level is trying to keep within view of some creepy robotic eyes, the game doesnt quite have the flashiness of opening and closing portals. But Pneumas puzzles still have a low-key charm that, at their best, can be every bit as puzzling and mind-twisting  and, most importantly, frustratingly annoying  as those in the original.Likewise, while the dialogue isnt quite as snappy, its still a pretty well-written game. Youre playing as an anonymous being thats suddenly sprang into existence, so you get to experience the joy he (it?) feels at simply being alive and discovering the world. Occasionally it all gets a little Intro to Philosophy-esque, but it makes me feel like a philistine to complain that a game took the Cartesian proposition of I think, therefore I am and turning it into a pretty viable plot.Where the game really falls short, though, is in the presentation. For the most part, it looks pretty fantastic. But thats also the problem  its almost too fantastic. I get that were talking about a game where everything has literally just come into being, but it still feels too gleaming and polished in places. Consequently, youre left feeling as though what youre experiencing is less a finished game and more a really cool tech demo.And at the other end of the spectrum, there are points where the game doesnt gleam quite enough. The breaks between each level come when youreI dont know, transported (for lack of a better description) from one section to the next, and theyre marked by your vision going blurry and everything vanishing from view. Thats not the problem, though; the problem is that when you start each new section, your vision doesnt always unblur fast enough, and as you move forward it can occasionally take a few moments before everything lightens up and becomes visible.", "date": "March 20, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
