{"name": "Mages and Treasures", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/10/mages-and-treasures-review-for-playstation-xbox-pc-nintendo-switch/", "text": "While I wouldnt say that lightUP is a developer that immediately springs to mind when I think of my favourite game creators, to date theyve managed to put together a decent track record. None of their games would ever be described as hugely original, mind you, but nonetheless, their games tend to be pretty fun.Or, at least, that was the case up until Mages and Treasures. Just about the only thing Mages and Treasures has in common with lightUPs other games is that its heavily indebted to the past. Like Milos Quest a few years ago, it borrows heavily from old 8- and 16-bit top-down RPGs, with treasures and enemies alike scattered all over the place.Unlike Milos Quest  and unlike any game from the genre worth playing  Mages and Treasures is unbalanced to a ridiculous degree. The titular mage starts off the game with the tiniest health bar imaginable, and is so weak that all it takes to kill him is being nudged twice by an otherwise harmless bouncing blue ball. It doesnt take too long to unlock a weapon  a wind spell  but you quickly discover that, too, is pretty useless, since it consumes your trace amounts of mana points awfully quickly. While this doesnt matter much against the blue balls, it does mean youre basically helpless as soon as you reach the first enemies that fight back, spiders who can fire off their webs at you seemingly without needing to reload, and who can fire in pretty much any direction  in contrast to your mage, who needs to be facing directly towards the enemy youre casting a spell on. This means you die pretty frequently, and you regularly lose a huge chunk of whatever treasures youve managed to gather.Bizarrely, while the combat is so over-the-top hard, the puzzles that are to be found here are pretty basic, and consist entirely of pushing blocks on top of switches. These puzzles arent that interesting to begin with, and they dont get more interesting the more you do them.This being a Ratalaika-published game, normally at the very least youd be able to say that the games one redeeming feature is that it has an easy Platinum  and while thats sort of true, since the Platinum pops after you defeat the second boss, it also means sticking with the game through the frustrating, unbalanced early stages, and its just not worth that.In fact, its not worth anything. Mages and Treasures may come from a developer with a decent track record, but this is proof that even developers who know what theyre doing have a misfire once in awhile.", "date": "October 19, 2022", "grade": "D+"}
