{"name": "Kung Fu Rabbit", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/kung-fu-rabbit-review-for-ps-vita-wii-u/", "text": "Enough iOS games have been brought over to the PS Vita that its become clear what makes for a good port, and what makes for a lazy one. Games like Burn The Rope and Jetpack Joyride: good, because they make use of the Vitas features in ways that differentiate them from the originals (they let you rotate the rope using the touchscreen and fly your jetpack using the rear touchpad, respectively). At the opposite end of the spectrum, theres ports like Draw Slasher, that add nothing to the original experience, but still charge a Vita tax.Im pleased to report that Kung Fu Rabbit is one of the good ones. Admittedly, it doesnt need to do much to earn that distinction  as a platformer, just having buttons instead of touch controls makes the game immeasurably better. But still, my point stands: as you play through the game, its clear that when the developers decided to bring it over to the Vita, they did so because they saw how the game could be improved by the transition, not because they just saw more wallets to be exploited. (Further evidence of this: the iOS versions micro-transactions are nowhere in sight here.)Of course, its not hard to see why the developers might have thought this way: Kung Fu Rabbit is incredibly hard in some places, and I cant imagine trying to achieve some of what youre expected to do here with only touch controls. Its easy enough to breeze through the early levels, but by the time I hit the middle of the game I was regularly dying around a dozen times per level. The jumps call for new-perfect timing, and if youre just a little bit off in one of your movements you go right back to the start of the level.(As an aside, its a little surprising more iOS developers havent tried porting platformers over to the Vita  its not as if the system is swimming in them at the moment, and, of course, the vast majority of those on Apples platform would be greatly improved by having the more precise controls. But I digress.)", "date": "July 30, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
