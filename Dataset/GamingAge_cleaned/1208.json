{"name": "Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/01/mario-luigi-paper-jam-review-nintendo-3ds/", "text": "In some ways, Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam is a wake-up call after the half-asleep Mario & Luigi: Dream Team.  In others, its the missing story that seems to have detached from Paper Mario: Sticker Star.  Regardless of which issue it could resolve for either series, Nintendo has one thing drawing fans from both camps: a game for both camps.  Its easy to wonder how that turned out, and in search of an answer we took to juggling two franchises in a single review.To answer the most and least obvious question, Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam is an RPG largely in the style of the Mario & Luigi games.  Developer AlphaDream committed to Mario & Luigis active turn-based battle system for the games primary form of combat and built off that foundation to flesh it out with opportunities provided by a player party of three  rather than Mario & Luigis traditional two.  Its also likely that the developer rationalized the setting would be more appropriate in Mario and Luigis 3D world, rather than the step back in dimensions that Paper Marios world would qualify.  Since its likely that many other careful and thoughtful decisions went into comfortably interlocking two successful RPGs, well skip speculating any further and decide that its not worth thinking about except that the title reads nicely.  Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam.  It says everything anyone whos interested is going to care to know, and its starting to feel like youre not very interested in sticking around for how this sentence is going to turn out.Story-wise, AlphaDream keeps things simple, taking the book weve known Paper Marios world to live within and placing it in a library atop Princess Peachs castle.  Luigi happens upon it, accidentally freeing every bit of menace and doubling the amount of Bowser in one world  not to mention the cleanup effort that our heroes will need to go through.  Luckily, Paper Marios somewhere, and with twice the Mario, theres half as much work, meaning that everything basically balances out to a traditional get Bowser plot.  While story isnt the games strong suit, theres more entertaining writing in Paper Jam than either series preceding 3DS game felt like it had, and even more importantly is that the pacing is wound nice and tight.Pacing is probably Paper Jams most valuable asset, as it applies almost universally to the game; battles and play out quickly, level design is nice and compact, puzzles arent convoluted, and even with succinct cutscenes theres the ability to hold the R trigger to speed them along.  Theres also not a trace of grinding, meaning that players will find themselves at a comfortable level so long as they clear the field of most or all enemies.One other benefit of a series mashup is that in this point of both franchises, players interested in a game combining them are also familiar with how to play either.  This means that where most Nintendo games would normally provide a careful tutorial for introducing mechanics, Paper Jam puts an asterisk next to any new element by having Starlow pop up and inform players that an optional demo and practice menu is available to learn the ropes before continuing.  Nintendo has been expediting their tutorials a lot lately, and this feels like a great solution to handling a span of players between newcomers and series veterans.In combat, the Bros Attacks have returned to feature action-based sequences with Mario and Luigi combining their powers for grandiose attacks.  Paper Marios inclusion adds Trio Attacks to the mix, which employ all three characters in Paper Mario-themed microgames in the spirit of Bros Attacks.  Some of these special attacks seem more useful, making others seem not-so-special, and while most are fun to use, it became that a select few generally did the job.  Interestingly, some of the more expensive attacks turned out to be ones frequently benched.New to the series are Battle Cards, which are effectively buffs and abilities that can be used without taking up player actions.  These are displayed on the lower screen, shuffled from a deck of ten in an active hand of up to three.  The general idea is that players can turn to Battle Cards as freebies for health, defense, or an extra attack, while others provide post-battle bonuses such as XP or extra coins.  This sounds like a bit overpowered, and that would be the case had they not been wrangled in with the new Star Points resource, which determines the cost of a card and whether or not the player can afford to use it.  While these cards add an additional layer to the game, I found myself turning to them to squeeze out as much XP as possible.Lastly are the Papercraft battles, in which the player drives a gargantuan papercraft character with which theyll charge and toss at other enemies on the playing field.  Make no mistake, the field is almost literally a football-size field of space due to the scope of these structures.  Players must balance their health and energy (the latter which is recharged by keeping rhythm on a musical platform where the heroes are cheered on) while maneuvering the battlefield to destroy enemies, and subsequently a final boss in the area.  Amazingly, this whole concept is handled rather well and comes off as fun and interesting where it could have easily been boring and tedious.  Its not perfect, and youll sometimes find yourself waiting for enemies to provide a window of opportunity to charge them, but its surprisingly not a massive fiery spot of wreckage that toting around building-sized constructions sounds like it should be.  If you liked smashing together race cars or Lego contraptions as a kid, youll find the fun parts of that in Papercraft battles.The music and visuals are up to par with previous Mario & Luigi and Paper Mario titles, although that means many sound effects have been recycled from those series for both economical and legacy reasons.  Overall, its got an aesthetic that blends both series as naturally as possible, with a soundtrack thats not annoying but also didnt stand out in any real regard (aside from a few environmental pieces).", "date": "January 27, 2016", "grade": "B+"}
