{"name": "TxK", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/02/txk-review-ps-vita/", "text": "In all honesty, Im not sure how to write about TxK. I blame my childhood.Believe it or not, Im not saying that flippantly. I never set foot in an arcade back when I was little, and by the time I was old enough to appreciate them, theyd all vanished from my city. What makes that relevant to this review is that the more I play TxK, the more I get the sense that a deep and abiding love of old arcade games is whats needed if you really want to get it the way Llamasoft/Jeff Minter intended.Thats not to say its totally impenetrable for anyone who didnt grow up shovelling quarters by the fistful into arcade cabinets. Most obviously, the music is pretty great; while classifying electronic music has never been my strong suit, to my ears its reminiscent of that whole Big Beat sound that briefly seemed poised to take over the world back in the 90s thanks to the likes of Chemical Brothers. Meanwhile, even if the games graphics are nothing advanced, theyre still appropriately colourful and psychedelic.How good are the graphics and the music? Sufficiently decent that even someone like me  someone with no love or nostalgia for arcade shooters  was able to get drawn into TxK. The game is just such a rush to play that its hard not to feel like youre soaring through space with some big (some may even say Block Rockin) beats pumping away in the background.(And, on a tangential note, I love the fact you can jump to certain levels in order to try to best your high score. Its a great feature for a game like this, regardless of whether youre just trying to get better one level at a time, or if you want to methodically master every single portion.)Of course, youll probably get a lot more out of TxK if you go into it with fond memories of Tempest 2000 (or, even better, the original Tempest). While Im in no position to judge how faithfully this game represents the gameplay on arcade cabinets or the Atari Jaguar, I can definitely say that there doesnt seem to be a whole lot of difference between how TxK looks today and how some of its forebears looked back in the day  with the obvious caveat that the Vita makes TxK look a lot better than either of those antecedents (if a little less impressive than Space Giraffe).", "date": "February 27, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
