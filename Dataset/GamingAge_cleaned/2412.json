It may say that its a 2.5D Adventure-Puzzle-Platformer, but that doesnt come anywhere close to telling you anything about the game.See, Rainbow Billy isnt really a puzzle-platformer  2.5D or otherwise. Its got an overworld to explore (which often feels closer to 3D than 2.5D, seeing as you can rotate the camera in some places), but the platforming is basic, and the puzzles that exist  and there arent very many of them  are so simple, it hardly feels like they deserve to be called that.Rather, the core of the game is that you explore islands on your ship  named the Friend-ship, naturally  looking for new friends to help you in your battle against the titular monster. In order to win them over, you need to defeat them in a turn-based battle in which you use the abilities of your existing friends in mini-games, and then their attributes are used to fill in shapes on the enemys healthcardthing. Oh, and you open up those shapes by having a dialogue with them and being empathetic.Like I said, its not like much else, which makes it a lot harder to describe.Visually, the game is pretty neat, too. Its got a retro animation vibe to it, in the vein of Cuphead, but the characters and environments also look like cutouts, a la Paper Mario. Its just one more way in which Rainbow Billy is unlike most other games. On top of that, the world is devoid of colour until you fill them up, so you get to see everything go from black and grey and white into full, vivid colour the further in you get.Just about the only real complaint  and its a very minor one  is that its very easy. Im a fan of easy games, but even I found there were times in which I wouldve liked there to be a bit of a challenge.Mind you, being too challenging would go against the core of the games ideals. Remember up top where I said Rainbow Billys ship is called the Friend-ship? Thats really this game in a nutshell: its relentlessly sunny in the face of a grey world, and you only win by making the lives of your friends brighter.Given were in the dead of winter as I write this  after a few very difficult years, in the midst of yet another pandemic wave  thats the kind of message I can go for. Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is a pleasant antidote to these times, and even if I cant describe it, I know I liked it.", "date": "February 9, 2022", "grade": "A-"}
