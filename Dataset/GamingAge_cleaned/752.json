{"name": "God Wars: Future Past", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/08/god-wars-future-past-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "A few years ago, Kadokawa Games came out with Natural Doctrine, a tactical RPG that, to be blunt, kind of sucked. Rather than abandoning the genre entirely, though, they apparently decided to try their collective hands at it one more time  and the end result, God Wars: Future Past, suggests that they learned from their failure the first time around.By this, I mean that the flaws that plagued Natural Doctrine are completely resolved here. That game was plagued by endless expository dialogue and lengthy explanations. God Wars still has a lot of talking, but it doesnt feel like a lot because of how its presented: in shorter, easier-to-digest chapters, so that youre not spending seemingly endless amounts of time pressing X to move on to the next screen. Im sure that if you added it all up, God Wars would still have a lot of dialogue, but by keeping conversations on topic, to the point, and confined to chapters, you never start wondering when a scene will finally end.It also helps that God Wars mixes things up in its presentation. While a lot of the character interaction is conveyed in the typical JRPG way  different characters slide on and off screen as they take turns talking  the game also isnt afraid to throw in some nice animated cutscenes. Theyre used minimally, but again, the simple fact theyre there helps break up the action in an enjoyable way.The other thing Kadokawa apparently learned from Natural Doctrine is that theres no point in making a game too hard. Consequently, while God Wars certainly gives players a challenge, its never impossible in the same way that its sort-of predecessor was. As with any tactical RPG worth its salt, God Wars definitely forces you to think strategically and grind your way through battles, but it never seems like its actively out to frustrate and annoy players.", "date": "August 28, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
