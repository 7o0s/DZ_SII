I certainly didnt hate games like Ladders by POWGI or Roundout, but I also didnt find either of them as engaging as some of the publishers previous efforts.This is what makes Gaps by POWGI so exciting for me. Its the first game from this publisher in a while that Ive actually plowed my way through. Id pick up my Switch to do one puzzle; next thing I knew, Id have done 15 or 20. If thats not a sign of an addictive game, I dont know what is.Mind you, the structure of the game lends itself to this kind of binging. The way Gaps works is that youre given a list of words, each missing one letter, then you find the missing letters, which in turn form a brand new word. I may not have described it well, but in practice, its incredibly easy to understand. On top of that, it rarely takes much time to get through a puzzle  every so often Id come across one that took me a minute or two to finish, but more often than not, Id finish one in thirty seconds and be on to the next one. That makes it awfully easy to get in a groove.Whats more  and most importantly  Gaps by POWGI is a fun way to pass the time if, like me, youre obsessed with words and spelling. Admittedly, if that describes you, it means that youll only get a few hours of enjoyment out of the game  but at least for those few hours, youll definitely be having fun with words.", "date": "August 12, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
