It features some of the best hack and slash combat on the Vita, up there with anything the various Warriors series have to offer, and its genuinely fun to button mash your way through wave after wave of enemies. On that front, the game is commendable.Rather, my problem with Croixleur Sigma is with what it isnt. Specifically: its not much of a game. It has four storylines, and you can beat all four of them in well under an hour  probably forty minutes if you really push yourself. All of them follow basically the same pattern, too: Girl A and Girl B are feuding because they belong to different houses at their school, one of them makes a lewd remark to the other, they go through the dungeons, and the story ends with your chosen girl victorious. None of them are particularly interesting, and the fact that the longest storyline takes less than twenty minutes to finish should tell you all you need to know in terms of how invested youll be in the outcomes.This near-complete lack of variety in the different plots is reflected in nearly every other aspect of the game, too. Every single dungeon youll encounter is virtually identical, round spaces in the middle of nothing that change colours every so often; one of the storylines features the odd ice-filled dungeon, but youll only notice its different once the level is over and it takes you a few seconds longer to reach the warp spot to the next level on account of the slippery running.Likewise, the enemies here show very little variation. Youll encounter some slightly more visually interesting and differentiated bad guys when you get closer to the end, and the final bosses for each storyline are unique, but for the most part youll be fighting with shuffling grey monsters. Considering how brightly coloured the game is otherwise, the decision to fill it with such bland-looking baddies is definitely puzzling.The sameness of everything is emphasized by the fact none of Croixleur Sigmas modes differ all that greatly from each other. The game has survival, time trial and challenge modes, but theyre pretty much indistinguishable from each other. Basically, if you can just keep button-mashing until all the monsters are dead, youll be able to get by.", "date": "March 30, 2016", "grade": "B-"}
