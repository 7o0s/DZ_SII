I knew something was wrong when we didnt receive a Tony Hawks Pro Skater 5 review copy until launch day. For me, I was once a die-hard Tony Hawks Pro Skater fan. My personal favorite was part 2 simply because they kept with what worked in the original, and then added just enough new content and features to help the game standout. I cant say the same about most of the other sequels. The series took a more story based direction with the Underground series, then got a bit wacky with American Wasteland, then decided to follow the simulated SKATE experience with Project 8 and Proving Grounds, which is really where I stopped paying attention.It got even worse from there. Someone thought it was a good idea to make a skateboard peripheral and a game called Tony Hawk: Ride, and this was the beginning of the end. Enter developer Robomodo, who has since been tasked with the last couple of attempts at the series, including the lukewarm HD Remake of THPS. All I have to say is, they dont have a very good track record and hearing about them working on Tony Hawks Pro Skater 5 left me concerned.In Tony Hawks Pro Skater 5, from the moment I had control of Tony himself, I knew this was going to be a Downhill Disaster. Glitches by God! There were so many bugs in my first five minutes of playing that I figured maybe they sent out early beta codes. How wrong I was. This is indeed the final release, and to make it even better, its a full retail release at $59.99. I know this isnt my closing statement however, PLEASE DONT PURCHASE this game. I wouldnt give it to my worst enemy. Ok, maybe I would.The traditional level layout in Tony Hawks Pro Skater 5 is mediocre at best and every challenge feels tacked on. In order to start one of the challenges, you need to skate over an icon. Guess what? There is a 99.99999999% chance that it will not work and you then need to pause the game and select the one you want. Who thought this was a good idea? Im not sure why they felt the need to have to load every single challenge individually. Some of the core elements like collecting SKATE and finding the DVDs and VHS tapes are there and you can do those without a screen prompt. It was nice to see them bring classic things like these back but its not enough to justify everything that fell through the cracks.I tried to play online the first day and couldnt get into a successful session without the game crashing. This allows me to not discuss what my online experience couldve been. Mission Accomplished. Is there anything to like? Maybe? I havent found it through my sessions. The level design is bland and uninspiring which was really an important trait from the previous games. Levels like the Hanger and the School were staples and gave players an enormous amount of replay to top their scores in HORSE or just free skate.", "date": "October 11, 2015", "grade": "F"}
