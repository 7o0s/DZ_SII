{"name": "The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/08/walking-dead-complete-first-season-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Im not entirely sure who the market for The Walking Dead on the PlayStation Vita might be. Sure, the Vita version includes the recently-released 400 Days DLC (rather than it being sold separately), but by this point, the game has already been on most major platforms, so I suspect the vast majority of people who want to play it already have. I mean, I decided to wait for the Vita version of the game after it was announced back in March (though, admittedly, I did play a little bit of the very first episode just to get a taste of it), but I cant imagine that making games specifically for people like me is all that profitable. (Though if it is: Ill take more open-world superhero games, please. Oooh, and a Vita version of Fables!)That said, whatever the reason for its existence, Im pretty glad the game is here, because  one somewhat notable issue aside, which Ill get to in a moment  its absolutely amazing. It looks absolutely fantastic on the Vitas OLED screen, like a comic book come to life. The controls (both touch and traditional) work extremely well. And the writing, the character development, the general tone of the gamehonestly, I cant think of anything else Ive played that comes anywhere close to matching The Walking Dead.Case in point: I cant stand kids, which means that I really dont care for stories  in games or otherwise  where youre expected to protect or look after children. Despite that, I found myself getting emotionally invested in the core relationship of The Walking Dead between Lee, convicted murdered, and Clementine, a little girl he stumbles across shortly after the game begins. When I, as the main character, made a decision that upset the girl, I actually felt a twinge of regret.My emotional investment went beyond that core relationship, too. There were points where I found the tension and the atmosphere almost unbearable, and I found myself thinking about the games plot, its characters, and its development long after I put my Vita down.Unfortunately, theres one significant issue that prevents the game from being perfect: at times (frequent times) it chugs along. If youre about to be prompted to choose your words or actions, the game pauses for a moment. If youre transitioning from one view to another, the game slows down. You only go from one scene to another after watching a Loading screen for a couple of seconds. Basically, youre going to find your immersion in the games plot broken pretty frequently. Considering this game is about as plot-driven as they come, that couldve been a dealbreaker.", "date": "August 27, 2013", "grade": "A"}
