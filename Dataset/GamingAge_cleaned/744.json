Yes, as in Jonathan Blows puzzle game from last year, the one that I loathed (though Ill hasten to add that others were more charitably inclined towards it).On the surface, this may seem like an insane comparison. After all, The Witness was a high profile console game, whereas Ninja Usagimaru: Two Tails of Adventure is actually a compilation of two Ninja Usagimaru games that came out on 3DS over the last few years, The Gem of Blessings and The Mysterious Karakuri Castle. Whats more, from a visual perspective, the two games couldnt be more different. The Witness was pretty stunning to look at, whereas Two Tails of Adventures 3DS roots are plainly obvious. I cant say I remember The Witness music (or if it even had any, for that matter), but Im willing to bet that it wasnt the same few notes playing over and over on a loop. Theres certainly no world to explore in Two Tails of Adventure, as each level consists of a single-screen, and they all play out pretty much the same: you solve a puzzle, you rescue a villager, you escort her to the end of the level. Repeat several dozen times, and youre done.So why, then, with all these differences, am I tempted to lump the two games together?Its because they, different though they may be in every other respect, they have a similar approaches to puzzles. Like The Witness, Two Tails of Adventure is firmly committed to the notion that there can be only one way to solve a puzzle. Dont approach things precisely as the creator intended, and you have no hope of reaching a solution.In fact, Two Tails of Adventure may adhere to this approach even more rigidly than The Witness, for the simple reason that at least The Witness didnt shut you down the moment you took a wrong step. In Two Tails of Adventure, theres zero tolerance for failure, and zero leeway given to experimentation. If you mess up a puzzle, you basically need to quit the level and restart right away (assuming you havent been killed off by a monster or an environmental hazard), because theres little chance for do-overs; if you dont play out each level just as the creators want you to, in exactly the right order, then you have no chance for success.", "date": "September 6, 2017", "grade": "C+"}
