Developed by Yacht Club Games, and backed via Kickstarter, I can say without a bit of exaggeration that this is one of the best 2D action-platformer games Ive ever played. Styled after the NES generation, Shovel Knight is packed with challenging level design, fun boss encounters, witty dialogue, and lots of nods to the best franchises in the genre.Seriously, its that good. I found myself constantly impressed throughout the adventure on a number of fronts. The level design in Shovel Knight is themed around the boss Knights youll encounter, ranging from Castlevania-styled gothic settings, to an aquatically themed stage filled with background gold. Theres a fair number of hazards to avoid, secrets to uncover, and challenging enemies to defeat. Bosses tend to put up a fight, with a series of recognizable patterns that take an encounter or two to learn, but many more to master. But Shovel Knights difficulty isnt unfair, as checkpoints are well placed, and the penalty for death isnt a limited set of lives but a chunk of the gold youre currently carrying. That gold loss can even be retrieved, not unlike picking up your souls in the popular From Software series Demons/Dark Souls.While Shovel Knight borrows a color palette that seems to be cribbed from the same NES titles it pays homage to, it manages to use that limited color set beautifully. Animation is solid throughout, both for the lead character and various enemies youll encounter. The handful of towns youll be able to explore are packed with unique villagers that are often worth speaking with for their dialogue alone. And the music! Easily one of the best retro-inspired soundtracks around, with a surprising number of unique tracks that you can also collect in-game and replay via the town collector you deliver the music to. Theres absolutely nothing in Shovel Knights art or music design that I found lacking.Honestly, theres not a thing that I can harp on with Shovel Knight. Controls felt great, even if I took some adjusting to the default control scheme (attack and jump buttons assignments felt backwards to me). But controls are also customizable, so that issue is moot. Jumping feels great and precise, I never found myself falling to my death due to any issue with the controls. Enemy hitboxes, and the range at which Shovel Knight attacks feel spot on as well. And the additional relics you can obtain, which provide fireballs, arcing anchors, and other abilities, outfit your overall arsenal quite well. Seriously, it feels as if the developers at Yacht Club Games sat down and really studied what made action-adventure games from the mid-80s to early-90s work, and applied all of that knowledge expertly into Shovel Knight.", "date": "June 26, 2014", "grade": "A+"}
