That depends on how you look at it.I mean, theres certainly more of Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3 than there was of its predecessor. The last game had 28 tracks? This one has 36. The second one featured 30 Nickelodeon characters as playable racers, with another 70 as crew members who give your racer a boost? Well, the third one features 40 racers and 90 crew members. Where you could race online with up to 8 players in the last game, this time out you can race up to 12 players. In every way you can think of, theres unquestionably more to choose from here.More isnt always better, obviously. Mind you, its not worse, either. Its justmore. And thats really all that you need to know about Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway: its just more of Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2.There are worse things for a game to be, mind you. Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2 wouldnt make anyone forget Mario Kart, but it was decent enough in its own right. Giving players more of that means getting more solidly competent  if unspectacular  kart racing, which is always fun.Plus, if youre okay with good enough, theres a ridiculous amount of content here. There are nine different cups, each with three speed levels. There are time trials for every track. Theres a battle mode. There are challenges. And, of course, theres online multiplayer. While none of the tracks or modes will make anyone forget Rainbow Road or Bowsers Castle, taken as a whole theres still enough to keep you occupied for a long time.Of course, that depends on how much you want to play a kart racing game theres merely okay, rather than dazzling or impressive. (Plus, youll need to be able to tolerate hearing these characters say the same catchphrases countless times per race.) As long as you dont expect too much  or, I guess, as long as you just want more of what was in Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2  then Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3 does just enough to be worth playing.", "date": "October 14, 2022", "grade": "B"}
