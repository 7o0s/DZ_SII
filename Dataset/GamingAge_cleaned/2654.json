This has both its upsides and its downsides.The upside is that I didnt need to be eased into the game  though thats not a huge issue here, since, much like most other POWGI games, its not only quite intuitive, its also presented in such a way that its awfully easy to pick up. Rather than throwing you into the deep end, the game builds up your confidence with puzzles that can easily be solved in less than 30 seconds (with the odd challenging one to give you a taste of whats to come). That, in turn, it makes it very easy to get into a groove of puzzle after puzzle, until the next thing you know, youve knocked off a dozen or two of them  along with no small amount of time off the clock.The downside, unfortunately, is that Ive seen how harder puzzles can be presented in a way that still makes them accessible, and Ladders doesnt do it. For one thing, when the words get longer and require more steps, it has to break the ladder into two columns, which  and I may just be speaking from personal preference here  makes it more difficult to visualize the chain.Even more annoyingly, there arent themes, nor are there hints, nor are there midpoints in the puzzles. This means that when you have to do a particularly tough transition, youre basically on your own. Turning, say, SPLIT into JOINT over 10+ steps would be hard even with a friendly hint to get you started; without, its just frustrating, and not in a good way.Also frustrating: when you solve a puzzle in fewer steps than the game expects. You need to be attuned to the games exact internal logic in order to solve the puzzles  which, to be fair, is usually not that hard, but still, there were times when I had no idea how to stretch things even further when the obvious answer was sitting right there.As complaints go, of course, there are worse ones to be had than the hard puzzles were too hard, and sometimes I got a solution too fast. Ladders by POWGI isnt a perfect word game, but its still highly enjoyable, so if youre fond of word ladders, its definitely worth spending some time with the game.", "date": "May 13, 2021", "grade": "B"}
