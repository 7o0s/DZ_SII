{"name": "Operation Babel: New Tokyo Legacy", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/08/operation-babel-new-tokyo-legacy-review-ps-vita/", "text": "A few years ago, I wrote (or at least implied) that your enjoyment of Operation Abyss: New Tokyo Legacy would depend largely on how much you enjoyed dungeon-crawling RPGs: if you liked them, you would probably like that game. Now, a few years later, that game has a sequel, and Ill say the same thing, but with an addendum: your enjoyment of Operation Babel: New Tokyo Legacy is contingent on a) how much you like DRPGs, and b) how much you enjoyed Operation Abyss. If the answer to both of those questions is anything other than lots!, then this may not be the game for you.In fact, you could probably narrow that down even further to only include the second question. Babel isnt just a sequel to Abyss, its a continuation. If you dont recall details from the first game, then youll be lost here; if you didnt love Operation Abyss, then youre not going to enjoy Operation Babel, either.Theoretically, this should mean I like Operation Babel. After all, I liked Operation Abyss, at least according to the linked review! But heres the thing: I dont remember anything about it. As such, analyzing how well or how poorly Operation Babel continues in the footsteps of its predecessor is a bit of a challenge. Obviously, I have to take the blame for that, but at the same time, it also means I can unequivocally state that the game doesnt have the kind of story you can just jump into. The plot is convoluted, the dialogue is seemingly nonsensical and full of non-sequiturs, and its not the kind of game that allows you to rely on context for clues.From a gameplay perspective, at least, Operation Babel is a little more hospitable towards newcomers. The basics here are pretty much the same as what youd get in any other DRPG: you move around a grid as the map gradually reveals itself, you encounter monsters and traps, and you discover goodies. There are some idiosyncracies, like blood mixing, but to the games credit credit it tells you what you need to know. Admittedly, it does so through giant walls of text, but thats still better than simply dropping players into the action and making them figure it out on their own.", "date": "August 22, 2017", "grade": "C"}
