Four of its five games could be the worst things ever, but because that fifth game is a new instalment of You Dont Know Jack  and a good new instalment, to boot  the compilation gets a pass from me.Of course, while those other four games may not be the worst things ever, a couple of them arent that great, either. Specifically, Lie Swatter and Word Spud are pretty dull. They may have certain aesthetic similarities to YDKJ, but thats basically all they have in common. Admittedly, I was only playing them with my wife, rather than in a room full of drunken partygoers, but at the same time, there wasnt much to them that would indicate theyd be better if you had more people. Lie Swatter is a big game of True or False? that doesnt go any deeper than that, while Word Spud isI dont know, a word association game? I played it several times, hoping it might start getting more fun, but it didnt take long before my wife was begging for us to play something  anything  else.On the plus side, however, Fibbage XL and Drawful are significantly more enjoyable. The latter is essentially a high-tech version of Win, Lose or Draw, and while it may not add much to the formula, its definitely a case of not needing to fix something thats not broken. (Its also a case of me not being able to draw with my finger on my phone to save my life, but thats another story.) As for Fibbage XL, its just a whole lot of fun  think Balderdash with a hint of Apples to Apples, and thats what youve got here. Its a little annoying that it doesnt give any bonuses for people who give the correct answer, but its funny enough that its not too difficult to overlook that little fact.And then theres the Jackbox Party Packs main attraction, You Dont Know Jack  YDKJ 2015, to be exact. Its not hugely different from previous versions of the game, but really, it doesnt need to be. Like those previous iterations, YDKJ still does an amazing job of mixing pop culture with seriously tough trivia, and it does it all with a perfect level of snarky humour. The old favourites  Dis or Dat, Cookies Fortune Cookie Fortunes, The Wrong Answer of the Game, etc.  are all here, while Elephant, Mustard, Teddy Roosevelt or Dracula? has been updated to Kangaroo, Peanut, Albert Einstein, or Uranus? to good effect.Having said that, I will say that one of games the biggest innovations  allowing players to use their smartphones instead of controllers  does fall a little flat. The idea behind it is fantastic; it means that, theoretically, you can have up to 100 players (at least in Lie Swatter  the rest are up to 8 players) in on a game without being constrained by the number of controllers you have. To do this, you simply connect by going to jackbox.tv and entering your name and a room code. While it worked most of the time, it also meant that if your phone drops its internet connection even for a moment, youre completely out of the game, and you have to start over. This didnt happen to me a lot, but it happened enough that it was noticeable.", "date": "December 11, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
