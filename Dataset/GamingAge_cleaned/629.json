Well I do! Times sure were dark back then, like most console launches. But us Nintendo fans know how to hibernate with little morsels of games like Resident Evil: The Merceneries 3D. But thats not what were here to talk about today, since on the Mercenaries 3D cart there was a demo for something even better!Yep, we got our first taste of Resident Evil: Revelations almost half a year before it came out. If youre not jealous now, you should be. I remember being so excited to have Resident Evil on the go that I even ran out to buy the Circle Pad Pro add-on that I never used again. Do you know where your Circle Pad Pro is?Anyway, since then weve seen several ports of Resident Evil Revelations both part 1 and 2, and each time its always a good deal. Its no different on the Switch here, with a game that runs in HD, uses both of the analog sticks, and of course returns all the way back to Revelations roots. Its Resident Evil on-the go! Again!If you havent played the series, part one starts with Jill Valentine and some fat guy named Parker who are investigating a scary cruise ship. What they uncover are a new mutation of enemies called BOWs. Theyre biological horrors who I always thought looked kind of funny. Or maybe they sound funny. They definitely dont scare me as much as normal zombies, but that doesnt mean they cant hurt you.Youre also looking into a terrorist organization called Veltro, but I cant help thinking of velcro and just cant take them seriously. I like this one a lot, and one of the new additions is the ability to scan your environment for hidden items and secrets. This reminds me of Metroid Prime and thats always a good thing.Part two has you starting out as Claire Redfield who is kidnapped from a great party and dropped into prison with a friend! This one was released in episodes and feels much more modernized than Revelations 1. You can tell the difference right away with characters who are super self aware and controls that I think are more complex than they need to be. Its also a lot scarier, reminding me of really scary stuff like The Evil Within.Yeah you can still choose a control scheme thats like Resident Evil 4, but the game has all kinds of stuff that feels just like what everyone else was doing in 2015. They replace the scanning in Revelations 1 by adding a partner who you or another person in co-op can control. Now this hip girl who hangs out with Claire is the one who primarily discovers stuff. This means youre constantly switching back and forth between two characters and it feels totally unnecessary.Anyway both games are a good time. Revelations 2 is a much prettier game by default since it was released as an episodic game to consoles at the time, and then ported later. Revelations 1 started out on the 3DS but still holds up on the big screen.I dont have much to add about the quality of the ports that other versions wouldnt tell you. Capcom gave us codes for both part 1 and 2, and from what I played its the same deal here as on their other console versions. There are some options that use HD rumble and amiibo functionality, but everything else seems pretty standard. The only standout issue is that Revelations 2 has much longer load times probably due to the visuals. The real prize is having them available on the Switch, which of course means the games always feel ready to play wherever you are.", "date": "January 5, 2018", "grade": "B"}
