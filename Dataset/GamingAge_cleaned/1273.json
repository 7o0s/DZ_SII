Sometimes, like with Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3, I cant get enough of hacking and slashing my way through wave after wave of enemies. Other times, though  say, with Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate  I cant get into them at all. It helps, of course, if the particular title has been built for the platform on which Im playing it (again, see SWC3), but generally, I find them to be hit and miss.One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 most definitely falls on the hit side of the ledger. This isnt too surprising; after all, I was a huge fan of both Pirate Warriors 1 and 2, so it stands to reason that Ill be just as fond of the third entry in the series.Unlike the other games in the broader Warriors franchise, though, I can tell you exactly why I like them, too. Simply put: theyre absurd, over-the-top fun. Sure, the whole Warriors concept of a single person taking on literally thousands of opponents at once is ridiculous in and of itself, but it reaches new heights of insanity when you pair it with an anime whose main character is, as far as I can tell, an undersized pirate-boy with rubber limbs. Whatever joy there is to be had in wiping out an entire army with only your swords (and dont get me wrong, theres quite a bit of joy inherent in that feat), it pales in comparison to the delirious insanity of wiping out that army with your fists, or a slingshot, or a piece of pipe, or a comically huge sword.And thats just your run-of-the-mill attacks. One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3  like the games before it  really ramps up the insanity when you get to the special attacks. This is a game in which you can go after your foes with sharks, or hearts, or even good old-fashioned fists raining down from the skies. It certainly puts the usual Warriors special attacks of spinning swords really fast to shame.This insanity continues when it comes to the story. Ive never seen a One Piece cartoon in my life, so I have no idea how faithfully the game recreates its storylines, or the extent to which it relies on pre-existing knowledge of the anime in order for it to make sense. I dont think it matters that much, though. I mean, when youre fighting evil pirates because one of them stole your restaurant, what kind of story do you need? Its the sort of thing you should just embrace and go with, rather than something you should worry about too deeply. Did I mention you can attack your enemies with sharks?The only area in which One Piece 3 doesnt shine is its graphics. While the cutscenes look solid enough, during the action the game has a bit of a problem with showing too many enemies at once. You know theyre there because you can see them on the map, but you can only see them on the screen once you get right next to them. Outside of Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3, this has been the common complaint against these games on the Vita, so its mostly to be expected, but that doesnt make it any less annoying.", "date": "November 2, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
