In fact, it might even be seen as damning with faint praise. I mean, its Tetris, one of the most widely played games of all time. Thirty or so years into the games lifespan, youd think its formula would be more or less settled by now. But these arent normal circumstances. These are circumstances in which Tetris Ultimates release on the PS4 back in the fall wasa little problematic, to say the least. You wouldnt think itd be the sort of game that could be screwed up at this point, but the ample number of complaints would suggest otherwise.Which, again, is why its such a relief that Tetris Ultimate works so smoothly on the Vita. Theres no glitching, no freezing, no tearing: its the core Tetris game that people have been playing and loving for decades now, working exactly like its supposed to. The blocks come down, you fit them in (or you dont), and as you make more lines you level up and the blocks start falling faster. Thats not to say this version is perfect, mind you. The online has been dead every time Ive tried playing the multiplayer modes, so I cant vouch for how well they work  though, on the bright side, the AI is balanced enough that you can still play them offline and not have the gameplay suffer. Much more seriously (at least as far as Im concerned), the music here is seriously weird. Rather than the standard Tetris theme, Tetris Ultimate features some weird remixed version that goes heavy on the melancholy. Its a little offputting to hear that iconic music chopped up and turned into something sad, butwell, thats exactly what they did.", "date": "July 1, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
