Hes in pretty bad shape when you first see him again, but that doesnt stop him from killing Nazis any way he can. And I mean any way. This includes him being bound to a wheelchair when you first start the game, which takes place immediately after the ending of The New Order.For those that havent played this previous title or its prequel The Old Blood, youre missing out and I would recommend jumping into those before you even pick this up. While its not required for the sake of the story, theyre just great games and youll get much more enjoyment out of The New Colossus by treating yourself.A hot topic as of late in the world of video games has been the decline of single player-focused games versus the games as a service model. This was briefly touch upon during fellow editor Stan on his Super Mario Odyssey review, which you can see here. For me, I have been and will always be a single player-focused gamer.While Ive said numerous times over the years, I dont play well with others, its primarily because I enjoy playing at my own pace, even more the last year and a half of being a father. Games like Wolfenstein prove that if the developer understands the foundation and core of what makes a great single player experience, theyre capable of putting out memorable works of art. In the case of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, developer, Machine Games does just that and then some.Theyve created a story that builds on the basic foundations of the original games from the 80s and adds a solid cast of well-developed characters, enemies and even some diabolical villains that leave a lasting impression. However, the most important trait that they accomplished was taking the time to focus on the core game and not tack on a multiplayer for the sake of adding it. This is something that was almost always a bad thing when added to an originally planned single player game.I understand the importance of appealing to a wider audience, but at what cost? With that said, lets get back to the game at hand. Wolfenstein is one of those games that not only controls well, it also looks fantastic. For the most part it runs at a solid 60FPS, which works beautifully with the nonstop action that the game throws at you. Like I mentioned earlier, you begin the game where the last left off. (SPOILER ALERT) Please stop reading if you plan on playing The New Order first.Ok, are you still with me? Great. So, we last saw good ole BJ Blazkowicz near death after fighting Deathshead and becoming collateral damage when the big bad detonated his own grenade blowing himself to bits. Before BJ bites it, his comrades come to the rescue and drag him to safety just in time. He then wakes up months later from a coma and must get right into the action as his teams U-Boat has been compromised and his only way around is via a wheelchair.This is just the beginning, and this is one of those games, that many people speak about in detail, but I feel most is left best to be experienced firsthand. I say this as someone thats a fan of the series and took the initiative to only watch the launch trailer, to play the game fresh. I believe this made my time with Wolfenstein II that much more enjoyable.One thing to note is, this may be built to be a FPS, but at its core, its much more. The story really takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, with tragic events that take place early on and one of the craziest plot twists in recent years involving such a bold change that eerily reflects upon how our current society handles politics, racism, and just the overall outlook on the world.Outside of the story, remember this is still an action based shooter and a great one at that. Just about everything that has made the previous two games in the series a blast to play are found once again. From Easter eggs that pay homage to the original game, but with a twist, to effective dual wielding guns, there isnt much not to like about it.", "date": "November 2, 2017", "grade": "A"}
