In every other instance of my far-too-long history with the series, Ive played it on the Vita. And you know what? Atelier Lydie & Suelle makes me really wish Id kept it that way. Admittedly, this wouldve meant playing the game on the Switch. But, regardless of which handheld I played it on, I get the feeling it wouldve been a vast improvement.Its not that Atelier Lydie & Suelle is a bad game, to be sure. Like pretty much every other title in the franchises history (save, perhaps, for Atelier Firis), it achieves a certain level of competence. The Atelier games have never been about breaking new ground. Theyre more or less the same thing, over and over again: Eponymous Girl X learns how to be an alchemist, gathering materials and fighting monsters in turn-based battles along the way. There are minor tweaks here and there, but for the most part, you know exactly what youre getting into any time you play an Atelier game.The problem, at least as far as Im concerned, is that that formula works much better in small doses, like what youd get on a handheld, than it does on a console. The gameplay seems to be designed for dropping in and out whenever the mood strikes you, not sitting down and doing the same tasks over and over again for hours on end.Obviously, this is all a matter of preference, and if you are the kind of person who loves doing alchemy for hours on end, then you should love it here as well. As I said, Atelier Lydie & Suelle fits right in with the franchises tendency towards quiet, solid competence  and, it should be added, it looks much better than it ever has on the Vita. Personally, though, it has me certain that wherever the series goes next, Im only going to follow it if I can play it on a handheld.", "date": "May 25, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
