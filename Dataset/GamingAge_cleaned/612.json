That, arguably, is the biggest franchise in the genre  and certainly the one Ive played the most  so for me, it becomes a matter of what it does differently, what it does worse, and what  if anything  it does better.In the case of Research and Destroy, the things it does differently are fairly obvious.First and foremost, it allows more freedom of movement for your characters  sort of. Rather than taking a grid-based approach and limiting the number of spaces anyone can move, youre allowed free movement for a limited period of time. Within that period, you can run around, shoot at enemies, and hide  all the while, with a big circle getting smaller and smaller as your time runs out. Its an interesting take on the usual formula, and it requires a different set of skills than some other games in the genre. It calls on planning, to be sure, but in a way thats more akin to, say, Superhot or Severed Steel or any other shooter where youre facing time limits. It can certainly add a little more tension, as your time ticks down and youre getting closer and closer to your objective, wondering if youll make it.The other big difference is that Research and Destroy pushes you to the multiplayer mode, which certainly makes things a little easier  assuming you can both get on the same page for strategy. Thats not always a given, of course, but the fact other players can drop in (or out) at any time to help you on your way to meeting the objectives makes things a little less cut and dried than your typical turn-based strategy game. Research and Destroy also deserves some points for its style and its setting. The game is set in an alternate universe where people just decided to ignore experts  totally unrealistic, obviously  which allowed for ghosts, zombies, and all kinds of other monsters to rise up and overthrow humanity. The whole thing has a 50s B-movie sci-fi vibe, which is fun, but unfortunately the game doesnt do enough to really explore its setting  rather, it sets the tone and then sends you on your way. Still, lack of story aside, its hard to argue that Research and Destroy doesnt do a decent job of developing its own niche within this crowded turn-based strategy genre. Its definitely better if you can play it with others  whether in-person or online  but its solid enough that even if youre playing solo, you should get a few hours of fun out of it.", "date": "September 27, 2022", "grade": "B"}
