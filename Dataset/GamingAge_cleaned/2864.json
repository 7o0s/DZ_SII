{"name": "Urban Trial Tricky", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/09/urban-trial-tricky-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Its never bothered me too much that the Urban Trial games are basically dollar store knock-offs of the Trials series. Sure, theyve possessed zero originality, but theyre always been perfectly competent stunt bike racing games that are a mindless way to pass an afternoon.With Urban Trial Tricky, however, the series seems to have gone veering off the rails. I hate it.The biggest problem is the grinding. Theres so, so, so much of it here. Sure, Urban Trial  and Trials games, too, if were being honest  have always been a little heavy on grinding, as you constantly have to go back and get more stars on levels to help upgrade your bike, but Urban Trial Tricky takes it to an obnoxious extreme. Right from the very first level, it asks you to achieve a certain total of points in order to make it to the second level, but then it fails to give you anything more than the most basic moves. Then it does it again on the second level, and the third, and so on. Opening up each new track is a massive slog, and it never gets any more enjoyable, not least because none of the tracks is that interesting to begin with.The other big problem is right in the games name. Urban Trial Tricky puts a huge emphasis on tricks, to the detriment of nearly everything else. Even the time trial tracks require you to pull off tricks to get boosts, which seems kind of silly. Worse, you dont get that many points for pulling of a lot of the tracks, so most levels are based more on quantity of tricks, which in turn makes them lose some of their lustre.To some extent, I get it. The previous Urban Trial game, Playground, was pretty easy to blast through, since the requirements for each new level were pretty easily attained. It makes some degree of sense that, for Urban Trial Tricky, the developers would want gameplay that would encourage players to spend a little more time with the game.", "date": "September 30, 2020", "grade": "D+"}
