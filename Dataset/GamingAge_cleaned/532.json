I was playing the game on my couch while my wife scrolled through her Instagram, and when I stopped playing, her response was, Awww, whyd you turn that off? (which, Ill add, is something shes literally never said before in the many years Ive played video games in her general vicinity).And honestly, its hard to blame her. The Wrath of Code, as filtered through Neurovoider, is one heck of an album. Its all icy synths and retro vibes, with a sound that simultaneously brings to mind the 80s and a sci-fi-infused vision of the future. If the album werent free to download on Bandcamp, Id say it was single-handedly good enough to make this game worth picking up.Of course, the fact The Wrath of Code is free to download (have I mentioned that already?), and can be enjoyed entirely separately from Neurovoider, complicates things. Dont get me wrong: Neurovoider is fine. If youre in the mood for a roguelite twin-stick shooter that feels like it couldve come out on the NES or the SNES, it will totally scratch that itch. But the gulf between Neurovoider (the game) and Neurovoider (the method through which you can listen to The Wrath of Code) is pretty vast.Setting aside its exceptional score, as I said, Neurovoider is a fairly solid game, albeit one that will likely only appeal to you if the words roguelite, permadeath, and upgradeable mechs hit your brains gaming pleasure centres. Further, you better be prepared for a challenge: as youd expect from the fact that permadeath is a feature, it should surprise no one that this is a pretty tough game.It balances that toughness with some heavy firepower. You can equip your mechs (which seems like the best descriptor, seeing as youre playing as a brain piloting a giant metal suit) with all manner of rocket launchers and grenades and guns and ammo. Aiming said rockets and whatnot can be a bit of a challenge, mind you, since the game demands that you keep moving around the screen unless you want your enemies to swarm you and hit you with weapons of their own. But, provided youre nimble enough, its a bit of a blast (pun not intended, but Im keeping it anyway) to blow enemy robots away, level after level, all the while knowing that a Game Over screen lurks around every corner.Still, theres little in Neurovoider that you wouldnt be able to get in most other twin-stick shootersexcept, of course, for that fantastic soundtrack. If scores were everything, wed be talking about an all-time classic game. Instead, its really more of a niche game, with a soundtrack that you need to go download right this second.", "date": "May 10, 2018", "grade": "B"}
