{"name": "Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/08/phantom-breaker-battle-grounds-review-ps-vita/", "text": "While I never played Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds when it came out on XBLA last year, from the sounds of my esteemed Gaming Age colleagues review, it doesnt sound like much has changed now that the game is on the Vita. Youre still geting a retro-inspired side-scrolling beat-em-up, youre still mowing down wave after wave of baddies, and you can still mostly get by  at least on the easier difficulty levels  by just spamming your attack buttons as quickly as possible.Above all else, though, the thing that remains true is the conclusion: this is only a game to get if that last sentence appeals to you, because theres really not a whole lot more going on. Theres certainly a bit more strategy at play if you try your hand at harder difficulty levels, but generally speaking, all youre going to get here is punch-kick-dash-throw-repeat, with the only real variation coming from your chosen characters special attack.The good news  to use the term a little loosely  is that while Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds may be repetitive, its also pretty short. While the game encourages you to try playing through with different characters at different difficulty levels in order to unlock every ability and trophy, the fact is you could easy beat the game with one character on one difficulty level in under two hours. Thats not inherently a knock against the game, mind you. This is, at its core, an arcade game, which means that keeping things short and sweet is fully intended.As for differences between this new Vita version and its XBLA predecessor, I dont get the sense there are a whole lot. Again, Im basing my impressions on the 360 version entirely on our own review plus developer 5pbs website, but it seems as though the only real difference is the buttons. Specifically, anyone used to pressing X to confirm anything will be a little confused when they find out that pressing X here cancels your action  a holdover from the original Japanese version, apparently.", "date": "August 26, 2014", "grade": "B"}
