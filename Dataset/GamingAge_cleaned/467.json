Yes, theyre blatant Trials rip-offs, but, at least on PS3 and Vita, I found the games to be incredibly addictive. As such, I was pretty excited to check out the series when it arrived on the Switch.After playing Urban Trial Playground, however, Im thinking there must be some serious nostalgia at work, because this is pretty much the definition of average.I mean, its not awful or anything. Like the previous Urban Trial games, Urban Trial Playground is a perfectly competent stunt bike racing game. The controls are solid, you can perform some solid tricks, and the visuals, while repetitive, pop off the screen here.The problem is that word, repetitive. It often feels like Urban Trial Playground only features a handful of tracks and a handful of possible requirements, and that the games developers run through all the possible combinations of those things very quickly. Theres not a lot of variety here, which means that while the game is moderately fun in small doses, it never feels very deep.Of course, thats only an issue if youre looking for something deep. If you just want something to jump in and out of without any commitment required, Urban Trial Playground will more or less do the trick. If you want anything more than that, youll probably have to wait until Trials Rising in February, but until then, this will act as an okay stopgap.", "date": "July 16, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
