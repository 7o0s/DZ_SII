Jurassic World Aftermath is one of the older titles, ported to the PS VR2 as a day 1 title. Having never played it on the Quest, or the non-VR version on the Switch, I was excited to check it out for the first time.The first thing to note here is the style in which the game is rendered. It is a cell-shaded, comic-book-style approach to visuals as opposed to a more photorealistic rendering of the dinosaurs. While my guess is that this was done to allow the game to run properly on the Quest, it does leave a good bit to be desired in my opinion. Seeing the cell-shaded dinosaurs definitely lacks the punch that a photorealistic dinosaur does. A good comparison in my mind is the Jurassic World Evolution experience on the Quest. While that is simply a short movie that you experience as opposed to an actual game, it shows just how impressive fully realized VR dinosaurs can be. Aftermath simply fails to live up to that same level of wonder, and I found myself constantly wishing for something more.The gameplay is a pretty straightforward hide-and-seek mechanic with no combat. You traverse the levels solving minor puzzles and constantly looking out for/hiding from (mostly) velociraptors. The occasional T-Rex encounter spices things up a bit, but the majority of the game sticks with that same cat-and-mouse with the raptors. If youre spotted, youre dead. There is really no in-between to be found. This makes for a consistent, if not overly engaging gameplay experience.While I found the experience to be a fine one, I grew pretty tired of it throughout the course of its six-ish hour runtime. The repetition, lack of environmental interaction outside of scripted objects, and overall environmental design wore out their welcome after the first three hours. By the time the game starts to really pick up (in what I believe was originally labeled Part 2 and sold as DLC), I was burnt out.As for the VR-specific elements, particularly comfort settings, Jurassic World Aftermath has a robust selection of settings and options to make the experience as easy to stomach as possible. As someone who has been playing VR pretty regularly since it became readily available, I typically turn most comfort options off and play with smooth turning, smooth movement, and no peripheral blurring/darkening, for the most realistic experience possible. For review though, I always make sure to check the settings available for folks who need them. Jurassic World Aftermath offers several pre-set options for your comfort, but also allows fine-tuning within those settings as well if you prefer specific things.", "date": "March 6, 2023", "grade": "C"}
