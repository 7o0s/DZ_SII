After all, I enjoyed the Tony Hawk remakes, and I figured that would be enough to get me into this game, too.I was wrong. So, so wrong.See, the very first thing you need to know about Session: Skate Sim is that its tough. Probably not as tough as real skateboarding, but its still a game where more traditional controls dont apply. Its controls are built around each thumbstick controlling one of your feet, and using shoulder buttons for turning. (You also use face buttons to push off from the ground, to add to the challenge.) Consequently, its not all that intuitive, and youll spend a lot of time flailing and crashing and restarting before you get the hang of it  and thats even if you set the difficulty at its easiest level, and play through the tutorial.And once youre into the game and free to explore the world, it doesnt get any easier from there. You go around the city looking for missions to complete (which are mostly just tricks to pull off), and you have pretty much no margin for error. You either do the tricks as the game wants you to, or youll fail and have to start over  or, more likely, youll bump into a wall or a curb and wipe out, and have to start over.However, the problem with Session: Skate Sim isnt how tough it is (though I dont want to minimize how steep the learning curve is). Rather, its how empty the city feels. Even though the world is full of buildings and cars, other people are pretty much non-existent. While I get that the lack of people makes skating easier, it also makes the games world feel a little lifeless.But if youre really into skateboarding  like, really into skateboarding  I have a feeling that wont matter to you all that much. Session: Skate Sim is true to its name: its a true-to-life skateboarding simulator, so if thats all you want to do, itll more than deliver.", "date": "January 16, 2023", "grade": "B"}
