Its the same game, only  as the title implies  youre searching for sixty words per puzzle, rather than fifty.Not that thats necessarily a complaint, mind you. Just like Fifty Words before it, Sixty Words is a reminder that video game word searches and crossword puzzles dont have to adhere to the same limitations as their pen-and-paper counterparts. They dont need to have square grids. Rather, they can use their words too create a skull (for a word search about bones), a treble clef (a search about music), or a boat (for nautical terms)Of course, the drawbacks of Sixty Words are also the same. Since you know that puzzles use every letter on the screen, theres not much of a challenge. The easiest puzzles could be completed in about three minutes, and the hard  well, harder  ones didnt take much longer. Case in point: one of the puzzle themes was Yokai, and I dont know anything about Japanese demons. I was still able to finish the puzzle in about 7 minutes. On top of that, theres not any replay value, since its not as if the answers or layouts change.With that proviso  that you shouldnt go in expecting a big timesink of a game  Id say that Sixty Words is a decent choice if youre a fan of word searches and you want something different. It wont take you more than a few hours to finish every puzzle, but during that time, itll serve as a pleasant enough diversion.", "date": "July 13, 2022", "grade": "B"}
