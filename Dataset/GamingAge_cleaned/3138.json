{"name": "Return of the Obra Dinn", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/11/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review-for-xbox-one-pc-ps4-switch/", "text": "Last time we heard from Lucas Pope, he had created Papers, Please, the game that proved that even clerical work could be intense in the right setting. Now hes back with Return of the Obra Dinn, and once again hes proven that even the most mundane jobs can lend themselves very well to gaming in the right setting.In this case, youre playing as an insurance evaluator and  wait, come back, I swear it gets more interesting! See, this insurance evaluator has been sent aboard the newly-returned Obra Dinn, a ship thats arrived in port with all sixty members of its crew dead. Its your job to figure out who died where, how, and by whose hand. You do this with the help of a death watch  or, as the game calls it, a Memento Mortem  which helps transport you to the moment of each corpses death, where you can watch as the situation unfolds. As youd expect, with sixty deaths to get through, this is one morbid game. Crew members are shot, stabbed, and crushed  among the many causes of death  and you need to rewind and rewatch all of them several times to figure out exactly what happened, and to make sure you didnt miss anything. There are clues aplenty in every scene, and you need to make connections between them figure out exactly what happened.As for that  the what happened  I dont want to give anything away, but needless to say, its pretty crazy. The story comes out in bits and pieces and gets well into the realm of the fantastical, but its presented so well that it always feels worth it.And speaking of the presentation, thats one of the neatest things about Return of the Obra Dinn. Everything here is shown in monochrome, as if youre playing on an early PC. Its a neat nod to the early days of adventure games, but the game controls so easily  everything here is in first person, and the controls are simple  that it still feels very modern. Coming after Papers, Please, I didnt think that Lucas Pope could top himselfand yet, here we are with Return of the Obra Dinn, and hes done just that. This is a fascinating game that draws you in quickly and keeps you riveted, and its well worth investigating if youre a fan of adventure games.", "date": "November 26, 2019", "grade": "A"}
