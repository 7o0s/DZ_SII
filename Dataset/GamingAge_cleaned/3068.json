{"name": "Jurassic World Aftermath Collection", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/01/jurassic-world-aftermath-collection-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Two things about Jurassic World Aftermath Collection that you may want to know going into it:The first of those is probably much less important. While in theory the game is tied to the more recent Jurassic Park movies, realistically all you need to know is that your character is stuck on Isla Nublar, and you need to escape before the dinosaurs get you. Theres a plot, sure, and it features some stellar voice acting to help move the story along (which Ill return to in a bit), but really, the key attraction here is that if youve ever wanted an entire game that combines some of the more intense parts of the first Jurassic Park movie  specifically, the kitchen scene, and the one where Ellie is trying to turn power back on in the bunker  this delivers on that.The games VR origins are a little more relevant. Its first-person, as youd expect, but your character also moves fairly slowly  presumably a holdover from when motion sickness would have been a concern. On top of that, its not the most demanding game in terms of gameplay, since most of what youre doing here is walking slowly to avoid being detected by some persistent velociraptors (and the odd other dinosaur threat), and then solving fairly basic puzzles. Id hasten to add, however, that even if Jurassic World Aftermath isnt demanding, its still a challenge. Those raptors pop up everywhere, and you never know when youre going to spin around and find your death staring you right in the face. This is a stealth game, so the slow movements fit in fairly well.Besides that, whatever the game lacks in terms of groundbreaking gameplay, it more than makes up for it in its atmosphere. Everything is shown in cel-shaded, comic book-like graphics, which probably makes the game scarier than if it had tried to mimic the movies. Because theres no uncanny valley to get lost in, you focus on what youre seeing, and the abandoned theme park is more than spooky enough to freak you out.On top of that, Jurassic World Aftermath features some stellar voice acting from Laura Bailey, who turns in a great performance as the person guiding you across the island. Save for a few guest vocal appearances from Jeff Goldblum and BD Wong, Bailey carries the weight of the entire story on her back, and the range shes able to display as no more than a voice on the other end of a radio is astounding. Its not often that voice acting jumps out at me, so the fact Baileys work did should tell you a lot.In fact, Id go as far as saying that Bailey pretty much single-handedly makes Jurassic World Aftermath Collection a worthwhile experience. Without her, this is a decent (if a little slow-moving) stealth game. With her literally guiding you through the ruins of the infamous theme park, the whole thing becomes worth your time and money", "date": "January 4, 2023", "grade": "B+"}
