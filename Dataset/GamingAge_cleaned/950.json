{"name": "A.W.: Phoenix Festa", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/11/aw-phoenix-festa-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Looking through the various reviews of A.W.: Phoenix Festa, I get the sense that youre better served by the game if youre not going in as a fan of the anime on which its based. After all, a lot of the criticisms seem to stem from how it tries to be all things to all people, about how it brings together a few different ideas but then doesnt do anything with them.I, on the other hand, had never even heard of The Asterisk War prior to this game. Even now, after playing the game and skimming the Wikipedia page, I have only a bare idea of what its about. And despite that lack of prior knowledge or, perhaps, because of it  I actually rather enjoyed the game.It helped, of course, that a major part of the game was simply hacking your way through enemies. In fact, as far as the action bits go, thats pretty much all there is to it. You have a bunch of conversations, then you can either take on new jobs (all of which involve fighting in some form or another), duel, or get into fights that help advance the story. (Theres also shopping and training, but those both take the form of clicking a button.) Admittedly, the combat does start feeling slightly repetitive after a certain point, but its spaced out enough and the fighting styles are varied enough that the certain point takes a long time to be reached.As for those bunch of conversationsI think there, too, my lack of familiarity with the anime and the characters proved to be a boon. I had no idea of the back stories involved, so I was able to take them at face value. I may have missed out on some nuances, but otherwise I found them to be surprisingly engaging. The romance aspects never quite did it for me  which, Ill concede, may be a bit of a failure on the games part, seeing as it is part dating sim  but theyre not so in-your-face that you wont be able to enjoy Phoenix Festa otherwise.", "date": "November 22, 2016", "grade": "B"}
