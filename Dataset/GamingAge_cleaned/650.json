I was blown away by the first one. I adored the second one. I was rather fond of the third one, despite/because of the fact it saw the series abandon its usual adventure/Ace Attorney-style roots, opting to become a third-person shooter instead.Somehow, though, despite all that, my reaction to Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony is basically indifference.Its not like anything has changed this time out. You still have Monokuma at the centre of everything, as rude and insulting and murderous as ever. You still have a group of 16 ultimate students, trapped together in a school. You still have the trials, where the students determine who amongst them is a murder and which end in the death of the unlucky parties. And, of course, its still all incredibly stylish.I think its that still in the paragraph above thats bugging me. No matter how cool the game may look or how diabolical Monokuma may be, its all starting to feel a little rote by now. The specifics of the characters ultimate abilities may have changed, but they all still conform to various archetypes that will be familiar to anyone whos played the previous games. Likewise, the school at which the game takes place may be a little bigger than the settings of the previous games, but just because theres more rooms to explore doesnt mean that youre doing anything particularly different in them. Its still an adventure game where youre looking for clues and chatting with/questioning classmates; having more, in this respect, isnt inherently better.Unfortunately, Danganronpa V3 seems to believe the opposite, and takes the more is better approach at every opportunity. Like Monokuma? Then youll be happy to hear that theres basically six more versions of him here, as represented by the six Monokubs who first welcome the students. Like the interactions between the students? Then, again, youll be pleased to hear that this game draws out their conversations, giving you even more opportunities to read them fretting about whether one of them could secretly be a murderer.Just about the only new thing this time around is the ending, which arguably recontextualizes the entire series in a way thats sure to leave some people infuriated.Personally, though? I dont think that a controversial, divisive ending changes the fact that everything that comes before it is basically just 35+ hours of more of the same. If youre a PS4 owner, of course, all of this will seem new and kind of scandalous, so I can see why it may appeal to some people, but for Vita owners hoping that the previous Danganronpa game marked a new direction for the series, Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony will represent a bit of a step back to the safe and familiar (to the extent, obviously, that Danganronpa could ever be described as safe).", "date": "December 13, 2017", "grade": "B-"}
