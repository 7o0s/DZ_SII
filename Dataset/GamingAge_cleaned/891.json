{"name": "The Turing Test", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/03/turing-test-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "As much as Id like to judge The Turing Test on its own terms, I dont think thats possible. Its a Portal clone, and thats evident on almost every aspect of the game. You play as a female character woken up in mysterious circumstances by an unseen robot. You move from room to room solving a series of puzzles, some involving cubes, all involving a specialized weapon/tool that looks like a gun but isnt. Gradually you realize that the robot may not have your best interests at heart. The specifics of how it all unfolds may be a little different, but in broad terms, its hard to imagine any two games being more identical.Thats not to say The Turing Test copied every aspect of Portal. Most notably, it lacks that games sense of humour. The Turing Test takes its sci-fi very seriously, and aims to be a meditation on what artificial intelligence really means. There are no sassy robots here; its just plot and philosophical discourse all the way.Which, truth be told, probably isnt the worst way to go about ripping off Portal. As far as Im concerned, Portal 2 might be the funniest game Ive ever played, so any attempt at copying that likely wouldve come off as a pale imitation. The makers of The Turing Test clearly recognized that, and set out to do their own thing. I cant say that Im as deeply invested in thinking about the nature of artificial intelligence as I was inwell, everything that went on with GLaDOS and Wheatley, but I appreciate that Bulkhead Interactive told their own story.Its just a shame that they didnt take a similar approach to The Turing Tests gameplay. As I said a few paragraphs ago, the extent to which this rips off Portal is astounding. Rather than having a portal gun, you have an Energy Manipulation Tool that closes and opens doors. The whole game takes place in a sterile, white facility, with reminders strewn about to hint at what may have come before you. Youre guided in your tasks by an unseen robot, who, while less malevolent than GLaDOS, still draws inspiration from the HAL 9000 school of robot-human interaction. Just about the only difference is that the puzzles here arent anywhere close to being as complex or difficult as they are in Portal  which, all things considered, is kind of a drawback.", "date": "March 16, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
