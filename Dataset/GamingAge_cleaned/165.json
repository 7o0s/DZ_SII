Along the way he encounters monsters, explosives, corpses, and a number of computers that reveal bits and pieces of plot.True, its not the most original setting. Nor is it particularly challenging  the whole thing can easily be beaten in well under an hour. But, for that short time, it succeeds in being fairly entertaining. Its got a spooky vibe, with a couple of creepy locations to explore, some well-timed sounds and visual effects to up the unsettling feeling,and a general air of mystery hanging over the whole thing.Even more importantly, its puzzles flow together well. Again, theyre rarely difficult, but they make up for it by being relatively logical. In other words, theres no goofy randomness here; you dont have to combine, like, a coin, a stick, and a piece of gum to make a lightning rod or anything. Instead, you search through those aforementioned creepy locations, find bits and pieces of computers and machines, and you use them to fix computers and machines. It may not tax your brain, but it keeps things simple in service of a simple story.To be clear, Planet RIX-13 isnt going to blow your mind, and its not going to occupy much more than an hour of your time. But for that short time, and within its limited scope, it provides decent entertainment, and that makes it worth checking out at its relatively cheap price.", "date": "June 7, 2019", "grade": "B"}
