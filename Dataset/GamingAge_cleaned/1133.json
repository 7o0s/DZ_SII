After all, it features all the hallmarks of every other game in the series thats graced the handheld: its still all about girls in frilly dresses running around a quasi-medieval world looking for ingredients for potions and fighting monsters along the way.Apologies for the self-quoting, but one year later, I could say pretty much the same thing about Atelier Escha & Logy Plus.There are worse things that could be said about it, of course. Over the course of the series lifespan  at least on the Vita, which is the only platform on which Ive played them  the Atelier games have consistently proven to be solidly above-average JRPG experiences. They may not be very surprising, but you know that youre going to get lots of quests, lots of crafting, and lots of turn-based combat, all of it wrapped up in a neat little package that will appeal to both veterans of the series and newcomers alike. So it is too with Atelier Escha & Logy Plus.Admittedly, things arent entirely the same here. For starters, as the title implies, the game has two protagonists, which means youre basically get double the gameplay. Or, more accurately, youre getting the same story told from two different perspectives, with a slightly different emphasis in each one: the Escha side focuses a little more heavily on the crafting (which is to say, as much as you get in every other game in the series), while Logy comes off as being slightly more RPG-ish (though only slightly, since this is, above all else, an Atelier game).", "date": "April 27, 2016", "grade": "B+"}
