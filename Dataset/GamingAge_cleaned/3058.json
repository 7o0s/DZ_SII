{"name": "Link-a-Pix Deluxe", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/02/link-a-pix-deluxe-review-for-ps4-ps-vita-switch/", "text": "Given the number of picture-based puzzle games Ive played over the last several months, I always like when these kinds of games are a little bit different from each other. Hence, for example, why I was unimpressed by Pic-a-Pix Classic 2, and its pretty rote nonograms  and, moreover, why I liked Link-a-Pix Deluxe..Admittedly, Link-a-Pix isnt anything ground-breaking. But seeing as I havent played many numberlink puzzles lately, it still felt like a nice change of pace. Ive gotten very used to creating pictures with nonograms and block-based puzzles, but numberlink pictures? Totally new(ish) for me.I mean, it obviously doesnt do anything that you havent already seen if youve ever played any puzzles like this before. There are only so many ways you can connect numbers on a grid, after all. And, to be totally honest, Link-a-Pix doesnt do itself any favours as it gets into the larger puzzles, when the matching numbers are well off of the screen and connecting some of the numbers becomes a bit of a pain.Still, its fun for what it is. Lightwood Games have proven themselves to be very good at creating puzzles that reveal neat pictures, and Link-a-Pix is no exception. Its always a pleasure to watch as images slowly click into place, and even if theres only one possible solution per puzzle, you still feel a nice sense of accomplishment. Repeat that feeling several times (since this game includes dozens of puzzles to solve), and you can see why its easy to recommend.Again, its nothing you havent seen before as numberlink puzzles go, and its pretty barebones. But, like most other games from this publisher, Link-a-Pix Deluxe is addictive enough that, if youre a puzzle game fan, youre guaranteed to sink all kinds of time into it.", "date": "February 28, 2020", "grade": "B"}
