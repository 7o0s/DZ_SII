{"name": "Underland", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/05/underland-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Pretty much everything in Underland moves very slowly. The characters youre trying to get from Point A to Point B amble along at a leisurely pace. The giant buzzsaw that cuts through the ground grinds slowly through the earth. The pits of acid that kill you instantly seep and ooze along the ground (except when theyre going downhill, in which case they at least move faster). For a game where youre trying to help astronauts trying to return to their families hidden deep underground, theres not a whole lot of urgency to be found here.While theres a lot to be said for living at such an unhurried pace, I cant say its something I appreciate in a puzzle-platformer  particularly when, as is the case in Underland, there doesnt seem to be any reason for it.My big problem with it is that Underland is seldom all that challenging, which means it often feels like youre waiting around just to do the most obvious steps. You may be able to see right away exactly where you need to dig out a hole to drain an acid pit  but youll then have to watch as your buzzsaw creeps along at a snails pace towards your goal.It also doesnt help that you control all kinds of objects here, except switching between them also feels like it takes forever. Take, for example, a level where you control a pair of teleporting machines, a pair of gates, and a pair of people. Youre constantly switching back and forth between all those items throughout the level, but you basically need to cycle through every one of them just to go from one item to the next. Its an arduous process that feels kind of silly when you take into account the Switchs touchscreen.I will note, in the interests of fairness, that theres one thing in Underland that moves quickly: you control carts filled with TNT, and those can zip around with great haste. The thing is, they might actually move a little too quickly, since its hard to get them in just the right position, and you can never tell just how explosive theyll be. This, in turn, goes back to the games bigger issue: you can position everything else just right, only for one ill-timed explosion to make all your efforts pointless and you need to start over  and go right back to moving everything slowly back into place.Clearly, there are worse sins for a game to commit than simply moving too slow. Underland works as youd hope it would, even if it doesnt work at a speed I can appreciate or enjoy. But you should expect more from a game that simply being functional, and theres nothing in Underland that goes beyond that very low bar.", "date": "May 2, 2022", "grade": "C"}
