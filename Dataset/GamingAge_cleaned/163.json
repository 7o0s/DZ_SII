{"name": "Elli", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/06/elli-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Elli has some pretty great influences. Its an isometric puzzle-platformer with more than a hint of Super Mario 3D Land to it, which is always welcome. On top of that, it has a visual aesthetic that draws heavily from The Legend of Zelda, which is also always a good thing.Unfortunately, great influences are really all there is to Elli. It may draw from a couple of all-time classics, but it doesnt really do much beyond that.It does so little, in fact, that Ive been struggling to come up with anything to say about it beyond Super Mario 3D Land + Legend of Zelda, but not as good for what feels like ages. Its one of those games that doesnt do anything super well, but neither does it do anything so poorly that it deserves to be called out.Take the gameplay. The levels are feel more or less the same. Fixed-camera isometric view, some light platforming here and there, no combat, and the odd puzzle that can be solved fairly easily provided you just keep moving forward. (Occasionally the perspective switches to a flat, 2D plane, but those moments are rare enough that theyre barely worth mentioning.) Thats really the entire game: as long as you keep moving forward for a couple of hours, youll be able to beat it.It doesnt help that the story is so completely forgettable I often forgot there even was a story as I was in the middle of playing. If pressed, I could tell you that it involves a pair of magical beings, and the bad one stole crystals from the good one on her birthday party, and the good one has to get them back, but thatd be the extent of what I could say. Everyone else you meet is indistinguishable from each other, and youre occasionally forced into brief cutscenes with no option to skip the dialogue forward. Ill call it interminable if, again, it wasnt so wholly forgettable.Ellis only saving grace is its visuals  which, again, draw heavily from Zelda. There are clearly worse games to draw from, but, at the same time, with so little else going on, its more likely to leave you wanting to play a Zelda game that to keep pushing forward here.The good news in all of this, as I said, is that Elli doesnt do anything so poorly that it could be called objectionable. Given how many terrible games are out there, thats no small feat. But its still hardly enough to make the game worth checking out. Factor in the games surprisingly high price ($20+, at the time of this writing), and that makes passing on it an easy call.", "date": "June 18, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
