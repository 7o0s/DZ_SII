I mean, if you think about it, Maxwell  the magic notebook-wielding protagonist of the Scribblenauts series  isnt that far off from Green Lantern? After all, both are limited in what they create only by the extent of their imaginations. And the whole point, speaking generally, of Scribblenauts games is going around helping people and solving problems. Its hard to think of a better fit than that.At least, thats probably the thinking that went in to Scribblenauts Unmasked. In practice, however, the combination of the two doesnt work out so well. Its not hard to see why, either: rather than making the game a reskinned version of Scribblenauts Unlimited  which wouldve been lazy, to be sure, but it also wouldve worked  the makers of Scribblenauts Unmasked seemed to have looked at the great power, great responsibility mantra and decided that the responsibility half was what they were going to make the game all about.Or, to put it more simply, this is roughly how it would look if you took all the side missions out of a superhero game, made them all even more mundane, and then turned those into a standalone game. Scribblenauts Unmasked may feature every character from the DC Comics Universe, but youll still spend about 95% of your time with the game doing things like giving people flashlights, rescuing lost cats and creating friends for the lonely. While Im sure thats probably what metahumans would do if they really existed, it doesnt make for the most compelling action.And as for that other 5%? Its not much better, Im afraid. There are boss fights, sure, but never particularly exciting ones. You fight alongside Superman, but he takes on Lex Luthor while youre stuck with Metallo. You take on Joker and Sinestrobut only in the sense that youre stuck with minions and lesser known characters while the big baddies have to deal with Batman and Green Lantern. Whats more, even if youre battling iconic characters, the fact of who they are is kind of irrelevant; it may take special knowledge to beat Livewire or Larfleeze in the comics, but here theyre dispatched just with a run-of-the-mill bazooka or some tempting food.Which leads to another complaint: even if you can draw (literally, pardon the pun) from the entire DCU, it doesnt add a whole lot to the action. I mean, if youre being attacked by Professor Zoom, you can draw the Flashexcept then hell just stand around doing nothing while you get killed. Coupled with the previous paragraph, it leads to a persistent feeling of Scribblenauts Unmasked being a series of wasted opportunities.It should be noted here that the 3DS version of Scribblenauts Unmasked is also missing one aspect of the game that would go a long way towards making it seem like you really are controlling a superhero: the hero creator. Both the PC and Wii U versions of the game have that tool, and  at least on the PC version  it works really well. Ever wanted to create a baton that shoots out explosions and makes your enemies fiddle  AKA the Baton of Exloding Fiddling Justice? Well, you can. Or, at least, you can if youre not playing on Nintendos handheld; if youre playing the game 3DS-only, youre out of luck.", "date": "October 10, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
