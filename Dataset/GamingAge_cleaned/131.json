{"name": "Anarcute", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/07/anarcute-review-for-nintendo-switch-xbox-one/", "text": "Anarcute wont win any awards for originality. Its basically a reskinned version of Pikmin, only instead of repairing a spaceship or helping aliens explore a planet, youre controlling a group of animal-people overthrow an evil corporatocracy.The lure of the game, however, is in that reskinning. As the games name implies, theres a big focus on cuteness. Thus, those aforementioned animal-people are, as youd guess, absurdly cute. Octopi, fish, rabbits, alligatorstheyre all represented, with lots more animals besides, and all of them are about as cute as you could possibly imagine, with their big eyes and exaggerated features.On top of that, the world they inhabit is a riot (pardon the pun) of colour. You have five cities to liberate, and all of them pop off the screen in vivid detail. Whats more, they seem distinct from each other  Tokyo is different from Paris, and both are different from Miami. It gives each world its own personality, and it makes it easy to get sucked in by the overall charm.Its just too bad that the originality doesnt extend to the gameplay. If youve played one level in Anarcute, youve played them all: you control the mob, you beat up the police, you liberate the animals trapped in cages. While theres some challenge to be had in figuring out the best route to take through each level, and there are some extra powers to be gained once the mob reaches certain sizes (my favourite being the ability to knock over buildings), the game mostly shows you everything it has to offer very early on.And thats fine, if youre okay with repetitive gameplay served up with some adorable aesthetics. There are far worse ways to pass the time than by grinning at the sight of a mob of alligators and fish shoving over a building. But dont go into Anarcute expecting something revolutionary on the gameplay side, because youre not going to find that here.", "date": "July 19, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
