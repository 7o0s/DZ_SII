And its not just because, going against everything in the characters long, rich history, said daughter belongs to the titular detective.Admittedly, that doesnt help matters much. In fact, its kind of emblematic of one of my key gripes with the game: it feels like they just slapped a bunch of stuff together and threw Sherlocks name on it, hoping that would be enough to make it all worthwhile. Sadly, its not, for two very big reasons.First and foremost, slapping a bunch of stuff together is a good description of The Devils Daughters gameplay. One moment youre examining objects looking for clues, the next youre running through the woods, timing your dashes so that you dont get shot, and another youre cracking safes or picking locks. The net effect of all the different tasks is that The Devils Daughter feels less like an adventure game (to say nothing of a mystery novel), and more like a collection of minigames. While theres certainly the odd skill that carries over throughout the game, for the most part it feels like a bunch of discrete tasks carried out in locations that have no connection to each other  their proximity on the games map notwithstanding.Which speaks to another issue: while there may be a map, its not all that useful. You fast-travel everywhere, meaning you dont get to develop much of a connection to Holmes London. Not only that, the load times here tend to be pretty long, which means that you spend much of the game waiting around to get to the next location: you go to location A to do one thing, then you wait for the next sequence to load; you go to location B to do another thing, then you wait again for the next sequence to load; and so on in location C, and D, and E. Add all these things together, and you can see why everything feels a little disjointed.Of course, this disjointed feeling hints at the games larger problem, which is that the storys not all that compelling. Some of this can be traced to the lack of respect for the source material. I mean, I dont have any inherent issues with the Death of the Author thesis, but throwing a kid into a Sherlock Holmes story just feels like its contrary to the characters essence. Even more than that, though, the mysteries youre tasked with solving seem to hang together by the loosest of threads, and none of them are likely to make you forget The Hound of the Baskervilles or The Red-Headed League. Much of the times the answers seem obvious, and youll often feel as if the game is trying to draw from modern action and adventure games, rather than trying to convey a compelling mystery.Also, apropos of nothing else: Sherlock here looks so much like Jon Hamm, it feels like developers Frogwares should be paying the actor royalties for his likeness.", "date": "February 21, 2017", "grade": "C+"}
