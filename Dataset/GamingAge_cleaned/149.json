{"name": "Back in 1995", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/07/back-in-1995-review-for-ps4-pc-ps-vita-switch-xbox-one/", "text": "As someone who spent the entirety of both the PS1 and PS2 generations playing more or less only sports games (and only on Nintendo consoles at that), Ive always wondered if and when wed see a revival of early 3D gaming along the lines of what weve had with the 8- and 16-bit generations. While Ive tried playing some classics of the era  Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Dino Crisis  theyve never done much for me, so I was curious to see whether some enterprising modern-day developers might want to revisit the period with the kind of love and attention we get for classics of the NES/Genesis/SNES era.Now that Im getting to experience what thats like with Back in 1995Im not nearly as curious.I mean, credit where credit is due: Back in 1995 looks, sounds, and plays exactly like youd expect a game from the PS1 era to look, sound, and play. You can almost see every single polygon on the screen. The music and sound effects are tinny. The voiceover acting is atrocious. Moving your character around the screen is a constant struggle, between controls that youre fighting against and a camera that has a mind of its own. Even the loading screens have little discs on them to fully complete the illusion.And, in all honesty, If you have nostalgia for the era, I could see this game appealing to you. While my only exposure to games like Dino Crisis and Resident Evil has come via PS1 classics, Back in 1995 certainly seems to fit right in with those for all the reasons listed in the previous paragraph.As I said, though, I dont have nostalgia for the era, which means that Back in 1995 just feels oddly antiquated. Its entirely possible that some enterprising developer can still revive PS1-era gaming for the better, but this game is very clearly not that.", "date": "July 2, 2019", "grade": "D-"}
