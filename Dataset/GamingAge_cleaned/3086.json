{"name": "Call of Juarez: Gunslinger", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/01/call-of-juarez-gunslinger-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Its kind of odd that Call of Juarez: Gunslinger exists as a game on the Nintendo Switch. I mean, it had decent enough reviews back when it came out nearly seven years ago  including from this very site  but its hardly aged into being a fondly-remembered classic.That said, Im not complaining too much. I never played it the first time around, and Ill always welcome the chance to play games I missed out on  particularly when theyre as fun as this one is.Call of Juarez: Gunslinger does so many things right, its hard to know where to begin. Theres the setting and the story, for starters: its set in the old Wild West, as you hear (and play as) a bounty hunter named Silas Greaves, who recounts his encounters with the myths and legends of the era. What makes it all so compelling arent just the stories of Greaves hunting down Billy the Kid and the Clanton Gang, but how unreliable a narrator he is. Throughout the game, hell give you the story one way, only for him to change everything when one of his listeners calls him on errors or untruths. It gives the game a touch of humour and adds to the tallness of the tales, and it makes it easy to get sucked in.It doesnt hurt, either, that the gameplay itself is so enjoyable. Call of Juarez: Gunslinger lives up to its name, and, as Greaves, throws you into a series of scenarios where you have to gun down wave after wave of bad guys. Its an arcade shooter that rarely wastes time with complicated mechanics or stealth: you enter a town or a canyon (or whatever other Wild West trope you can think of), and you go out in a blaze of glory with your trusty shotgun/rifle/six-shooter.If theres any criticism to be made of Call of Juarez: Gunslinger on the Switch, its that this is the exact same game that came out back in 2013. Theres no remaster here, theres no extra content  its identical, just on a Nintendo platform for the first time.", "date": "January 28, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
