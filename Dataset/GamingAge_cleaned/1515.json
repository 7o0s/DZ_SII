{"name": "Atelier Ayesha Plus: The Alchemist of Dusk", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/02/atelier-ayesha-plus-alchemist-dusk-review-ps-vita/", "text": "To the untrained eye, Atelier Ayesha Plus: The Alchemist of Dusk may look like just another Atelier game on the Vita. After all, it features all the hallmarks of every other game in the series thats graced the handheld: its still all about girls in frilly dresses running around a quasi-medieval world looking for ingredients for potions and fighting monsters along the way.Actually, writing it all out like that, Im struck by how true that is: Atelier Ayesha isnt hugely different from Ateliers Totori, Rorona or Meruru. And yetit is. For starters, the graphics  especially during the cutscenes  are markedly better. Everything here has a dreamlike quality to it, and the same couldnt be said (at least to this extent) about any of the previous games.Its possible, of course, that Im just suffering from recency bias here. Or, even more likely, Im being influenced by the slightly more melancholic tone this game has compared to others in the series. Where those previous games were all about bizarrely young girls making their ways in the world and proving their capitalist mettles (this particular graphic pretty much sums them all up), Atelier Ayesha has a much more personal, emotional tone: its about a young girl trying to find her sister, and she can only find her by interacting with her world and recovering lost memories.Thats not to say the game doesnt have a lot of same stuff those previous games featured. As I said up in the first paragraph, youre still wandering around fields in a medieval-seeming world, searching for ingredients and fighting fearsome monsters. Youre still managing your inventory and learning all kinds of new recipes. The difference, though, is that thats not the whole game. Youre now learning and doing all those things because they serve a greater goal: finding your sister.As if to reinforce that fact, Atelier Ayesha significantly de-emphasizes its calendar. No longer are you a slave to deadlines and meeting certain targets by specific dates; here you have all the time in the world to do whatever you want. On top of that, it rewards you for exploring and engaging with the world; you get memory points just for talking to new people, whether theyre main characters or simply bystanders.", "date": "February 11, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
