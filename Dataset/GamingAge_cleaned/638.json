{"name": "Nights of Azure 2: Bride of the New Moon", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/12/nights-azure-2-bride-new-moon-review-ps4-switch-pc/", "text": "I think I owe the Atelier series an apology. For the last couple of titles in that franchise, Ive been a little dismissive of them due to the fact that all the games are basically the same. Now that Ive played Nights of Azure 2: Bride of the New Moon, and Ive seen what else Gust can dowell, Im not so sure its an improvement.Interestingly, the premise of Nights of Azure 2 isnt that far removed from an Atelier game. Its still, at heart, a game about female friendship. Its just that, this time out, the friendships seem a lot less wholesome and a whole lot more sexually charged. It may never be explicitly stated, but the subtext here  both in terms of the actual dialogue and in terms of the games yuri roots  makes it pretty clear that theres some non-platonic feelings between many of the characters.Dont get me wrong: I have no problem with a game displaying same-sex relationships. Its just that it seems a lot less empowering and progressive, and a lot more exploitative and icky, when the characters involved in the relationship are ultra-busty vixens wearing boob armour that heaves and wobbles with every breath they take. I dont want to dismiss the moments of surprising tenderness entirely, but its a lot harder to take them seriously in that broader context, you know?Nights of Azure 2s gameplay is also a lot more cumbersome than anything youd find in the Atelier series, too. While Ive always had my complaints about turn-based combat, for example, at least those games made it easy to tell who you were fighting and what you were doing. Here, by contrast, its mainly about mashing buttons wildly and hoping you connect with one of the multitudes of monsters surrounding you. Everything feels kind of floaty, and none of the attacks feel like they have much heft behind them. As someone who usually loves hacking and slashing my way through enemies, thats a letdown. Similarly, the game drowns you in text from the get-go, opting for the info dump method of storytelling. While this is something Atelier games do too, to some extent, theyre not as guilty of it as this game, where you can frequently trigger 10+ minutes of unskippable cutscenes and dialogues.That said, Nights of Azure 2 isnt all bad. Its got a distinctive look and feel, which isnt something that can be said 20+ games into Atelier. Setting aside the ridiculous clothing choices of many of the characters, theres no denying that this game features some dazzling environments.I wouldnt say thats enough to offset the dialogue, bad camera controls, and leering fanservice, though. Nights of Azure 2 may represent a departure from the developers norm, but its also proof that simply being different isnt inherently a good thing.", "date": "December 29, 2017", "grade": "C+"}
