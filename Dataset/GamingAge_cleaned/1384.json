{"name": "Game of Thrones A Nest of Vipers", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/07/game-of-thrones-a-nest-of-vipers-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "Dubbed A Nest of Vipers, this fifth installment of Telltales Game of Thrones series is aptly named. Coming off of the action-packed fourth episode, which gave us numerous reasons to cheer on House Forrester, theres a number of unfortunate events in store for those that thought things were looking up for the Northern clan.Ramsay continues to be one awful SOB this episode, revisiting the Forrester home base while making a number of not-so-idle threats thatll lead into the final showdown between the Forrester and Whitehill clans. Rodriks leadership is called into question, a traitor is revealed, family is briefly (and tragically) reunited, and Mira gains a potential, unlikely ally in Kings Landing.Theres also some other familiar faces from the TV show that reappear, pulling the story of Telltales game into the events of Season 4 nicely. Theres one particularly fun use of the standard so and so will remember that mechanic, and also one really tough choice in store for those that hit the final moments of this chapter. Ill be pretty curious to see what the final breakdown is on that last decision, I imagine itll split pretty evenly.This chapter is not nearly as action-focused as the last, but there are a couple events that involve mostly hand-to-hand combat sequences, primarily from Asher and Beskhas point of view. Everything else about this chapter is pretty much par for the course as far as dialogue options go, with some of your actions from the last chapter already appearing to have ramifications here.My only real issue with A Nest of Vipers comes from the opening of Ashers sequence, dovetailing off of his mission for Daenerys. I felt like shes a bit too cold and unreasonable in comparison to her TV/Book portrayal, in regards to how events went down based on my actions in the last episode. Maybe Im being a bit too picky here, but it didnt feel entirely true to her character for me.", "date": "July 23, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
