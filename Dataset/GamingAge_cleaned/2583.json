You can probably blame/credit the likes Tim Schaeffer and Ron Gilbert and LucasArts as a whole for that, since the games they created twenty to thirty years ago  be it the Monkey Island series, Grim Fandango, or Maniac Mansion, among others  all had quirkiness at the core of their respective premises. Since they were hits, others followed suit, and now pretty much the whole genre strives for that jokey tone that was perfected in the 90s.Sumatra: Fate of Yandi is an exception to that. Its resolutely serious, with very little in the way of humour and nothing in the way of quirk. As the title implies, its set in Indonesia, where you follow the titular Yandi as he makes his way home after a logging accident. Along the way, he sees the environmental damage his job for a logging company has caused, and he makes friends with the local Indigenous communities.This straightforwardness extends to the gameplay, too. While you have to solve plenty of environmental puzzles, theyre not of the shave a cat and find some chewing gum and use the cat fur as a fake moustache variety. Rather, theyre life and death things like find duct tape to wrap around a holey bottle to block the holes so you can get water from the stream or start a fire to smoke some bees out from their hive. While youre sometimes have to search for the individual items that will help you, you never really need to think in the abstract or try to figure out what, exactly, the developers were thinking.Thats not exactly a complaint, mind you. Given how some adventure games seem to strive to be as obscure or as complicated as possible, its kind off neat to play something like Sumatra: Fate of Yandi thats exactly what it seems. On top of that, the game also deserves credit for its setting  there arent exactly a tonne of games set in rural Indonesia, after all.But at the same time, perhaps because the genre has become so intertwined with a very specific style, its hard not to wish there was a little more than meets the eyei. Its a solid adventure game, to be sure, but given how many other adventure games are out there on every single platform, you need to be more than solid to stand out  and Sumatra: Fate of Yandi is missing that extra oomph that would put it over the edge.", "date": "August 9, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
