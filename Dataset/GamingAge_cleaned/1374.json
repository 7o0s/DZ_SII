{"name": "Kings Quest A Knight to Remember", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/kings-quest-a-knight-to-remember-review-for-pc-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "As someone with no real working knowledge of the Kings Quest series, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this new take on the well-loved PC series by developer The Odd Gentlemen. The first episode, released last week on a variety of platforms, focuses on series hero Graham as he recounts a tale to his adventurous granddaughter, showcasing one of Grahams earliest exploits in the land of Daventry.Yes, its an episodic adventure game, and a bit pricey when compared to the popular Telltale Games titles, but theres a fair amount of gameplay here. Its also decidedly different than the narrative focused Telltale formula, which helps set Kings Quest apart as a unique call-back to the series that spawned it. The dialogue and story are humor-driven, and theres a hefty amount of puzzle solving and exploration throughout this first chapter. Even some of the humorous death sequences found in previous Kings Quest titles return here.That said, for modern players, sometimes the backtracking gets to be a bit tedious. Loading isnt a huge issue, but its noticeable even on PC at times (on a non-SSD at least). Also, some areas get repeated throughout this first chapter, but the sequences that feature the same area are at least wildly different from one another, and make a bit of sense from a story perspective.On the PC side, controls are pretty much fine across the board. I preferred a controller for analog movement, but the game is perfectly playable with mouse and keyboard. Also, Kings Quest looks solid on a moderate PC build, and I really enjoyed the choice of animated art-style for the various characters here. I do think some environments are a bit drab by comparison, but all in all, this first episode of Kings Quest is a solid-looking game.", "date": "August 3, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
