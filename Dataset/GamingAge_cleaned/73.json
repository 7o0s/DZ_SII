{"name": "Etherborn", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/09/etherborn-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Ive got good news and Ive got bad news about Etherborn.The good news is that it feels weightless and ephemeral.Unfortunately, thats the bad news, too.In other words, what makes it worth playing is also what, ultimately, makes it kind of forgettable. On the one hand, it all feels kind of dreamlike. Youre wandering through a world where you can run up walls, and where gravity is constantly shifting and moving around depending on where youre walking. Your character looks like some alien with translucent skin. Theres some mumbo-jumbo story thrown in about birth and truth. All in all, Etherborn feels like an Escher painting comenot quite to life, but definitely to a hazy, multicoloured dream.Unfortunately, now that Ive finished it, it feels more like a barely-remembered dream. I know that it got slightly harder the further in I got, but all that sticks with me is that I was running up walls and around corners. Couple that with the fact it was pretty short, and it all blends together in my memory.That said, its a pleasant memory. I wouldnt say I ever actively disliked any moment of my brief time with the game. The camera was occasionally annoying, but it never got too much in the way. There were a couple of jumps that were hard to judge based on the shifting perspective, but they were never impossible. Etherborn offers a pleasantly unmemorable hour or so, and if you dont mind a game thatll be out of your memory shortly after youve finished it, you could do a lot worse than experience its Escher-inspired trippiness.", "date": "September 9, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
