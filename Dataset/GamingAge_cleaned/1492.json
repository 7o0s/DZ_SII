{"name": "Unmechanical: Extended", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/03/unmechanical-extended-review-for-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "It feels like the term good little game was created with Unmechanical: Extended in mind. After all, its short, its cute, and itswell, its good.Does that lack of description bother you? It bothers me, too, but honestly, its not like this is the sort of game that you can really go on at length about. Its an enjoyable little puzzle game in which youre trying to guide a small flying robot to freedom. Theres not really a story beyond the fact that hes trapped, and you only have to guide him through five levels to get him out. If youre particularly motivated and puzzle-minded, you could probably start this game after lunch one day and finish it long before dinner.I should emphasize I dont mean that in any kind of malicious way. Rather, its a statement of fact. Ill also emphasize that rushing through Unmechanical: Extended probably doesnt do it justice. While the five levels may not be huge, theyre still meant to be explored, and the games unnamed main character moves so slowly, it seems likely that the developers meant for you to move unhurriedly through each level as you take in the atmosphere and feel out solutions for the various puzzles they contain.This isnt entirely a good thing, though. Its great that the developers want you to find your way through the game, but it still offers a distinct lack of hand-holding. As in: it offers zero help to anyone who needs it. I mean, its not a massive problem, since everything here is so straightforward and basic that youll figure everything out pretty quickly, but bells and whistles in the form of, say, a control map and maybe a restart from last checkpoint menu option still wouldve been nice.", "date": "March 11, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
