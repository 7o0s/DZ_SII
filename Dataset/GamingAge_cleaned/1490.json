{"name": "Mechanic Battle", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/06/mechanic-battle-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Notwithstanding its title and an eShop description promising (h)ours of blood, sweat, customising, and repairs, you dont actually spend all that much time in Mechanic Battle playing as a mechanic. While you occasionally have to play very brief minigames that involve tasks like tightening screws, for the most part all you have to do in this game to improve your car is pick a new part and pay for it out of your race winnings.I cant say that I minded this all that much. I dont hate job simulators, but I dont love them either, so its not like Im deeply offended Mechanic Battle would deprive me of hours spent working on imaginary cars.However, without the hardcore mechanic action the game promises, all youre left with is a pretty generic top-down racing game. Theres enough variety in the tracks and the racing modes that it never feels like youre just doing the same thing over and over and over, but thats counterbalanced by the fact that the controls are a little wonky. You can tinker around with how your cars are balanced, but its still not enough to make up for the fact its awfully easy to flip over, and unless you take some turns at just the right angle youre liable to get stuck against one of the many obstacles that populate the side of every track.But overall, Mechanic Battle is fine  its not great, but its also not horrible. It may not let you live out your dreams of being a mechanic, but if you just want top-down racing, itll do.", "date": "June 20, 2022", "grade": "C"}
