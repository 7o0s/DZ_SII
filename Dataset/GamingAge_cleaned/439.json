{"name": "de Blob", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/08/de-blob-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Truth be told, pretty much everything I wrote about this remastered version of de Blob back in January still stands today. In fact, just about the only difference is that the January review was of the Xbox One version of the game, whereas now, Im writing about the Switch version.That means, however, that one key thing remains the same: de Blob is still one of my all-time favourite games. That, in turn, means that if I have an opportunity to rave about it and say how much fun it is, Im going to grab it.Because, seriously, de Blob is so much fun, particularly now that its swapped the originals motion controls for more standard controls. The game is so brightly coloured and so easy to pick up and play (pun not intended for the Switch version) that, at least for me, its impossible to not have a big smile on your face as you bounce around Chroma City, painting it all kinds of colours. The fact you can do all that without having to do any waggling only makes things better.To be sure, de Blob still isnt perfect. As I said back at the beginning of the year, the levels are a little lengthy, particularly when there arent obvious save points. Whats more, the camera is a bit of a pain sometimes, occasionally not cooperating when you want to get a better angle on where the eponymous blob is situated. In fact, I feel like the awkward camera is even more noticeable on the Switch, at least when youre playing in handheld mode.Still, those two issues dont amount to much when theyre up against the fact that everything else about de Blob is so wonderful. This was an underrated gem on the Wiis library, and its remastered version on the Switch is giving people a second chance to discover it. If youre wise (and, obviously, youre into inventive platformers), dont miss out on it this time.", "date": "August 10, 2018", "grade": "A"}
