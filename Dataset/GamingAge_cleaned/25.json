After all, its built around the proposition that theres literally nothing more innately hilarious than cartoon animals swearing a lot, with pop culture references and a bit of ultra-violence thrown in for good measure. Basically, think of it as a slightly edgier version of Family Guy.Okay, thats a lot blow. Its not that terrible. But for a game built almost entirely around theoretically funny writing, the jokes here kind of suck. As I said, the humour is generally relies on the premise that if a cute (well, cute-ish) animal says something outrageous, like calling another animal retarded and throwing in a couple of choice swear words for good measure, its inherently hilarious. Unfortunately, the end result is less funny, more mildly transgressive, and even then, theyre only transgressive if youve been living under a rock for the last two or three decades.The gameplay itself is mostly an afterthought to watching the two main characters, Larry the dog and Hank the rabbit, bicker and connive their way through a zombie apocalypse, driving from location to location as they enlist various passersby in their schemes and try and get an invite into the scavengers guild. Occasionally you get to pick a line, but they dont add that much to Scheming Through The Zombie Apocalypse. There are also a few mini-games, like picking locks or a dice game, but theyre rare enough that theyre basically inconsequential.Which brings it all back to the writing. Humour is extremely subjective, so Im sure that some people out there will think that Scheming Through The Zombie Apocalypse is absolutely hilarious, and if they do, I wont judge them too much for it. Personally, though, I like funny games that are, you know, actually funny, which is why its hard to get too enthusiastic for this one.", "date": "October 11, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
