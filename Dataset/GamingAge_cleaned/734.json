{"name": "Voyage", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/09/voyage-review-for-playstation-switch-xbox-pc/", "text": "As much as I like Ratalaikas catalogue, I think its safe to say that theyre not exactly known for publishing very original or distinctive games. Even when were talking about the publishers very best games  say, Nexomon, or Ultra Hat Dimension  were still talking about titles that follow in the obvious footsteps of other games, without doing much to stray from the originals.This is what makes Voyage so strange. Its published by Ratalaika, but it doesnt instantly make you think of countless other games. It looks like a wholly original creation, which makes it a rarity.Admittedly, the operative word here is looks, since when it comes to gameplay, Voyage hardly breaks new ground. While it offers you minimal clues as to what to do when you start playing, eventually you figure out that its a pretty standard puzzle-platformer. Whats more, the puzzles are very rarely challenging  generally speaking, youre just pulling and pushing various objects back and forth, and giving the other player a hand up to reach ledges. For the odd time when you cant figure out what to do next, theres a hint button  though, as with everything else in Voyage, its up to you to find that out, since it cant be stated enough just how little direction this game gives you.However, its easy to overlook how untaxing Voyages gameplay is on account of how gorgeous it is. Every single environment you come across is beautiful, and each of them are different enough from the others that you cant help but stop every time you reach a new area to appreciate how nice it looks. As I said above, given how much Ratalaika games usually try to fit into what youd expect from their chosen genres, its startling to see a game like this, that doesnt look like anything else I can think of.Moreover, Voyage is probably the first game Ive ever played from Ratalaika where its visuals are so good that they make the game worth playing, even if the gameplay itself isnt that challenging or exciting. It may not mean that you need to stop what youre doing right now to play Voyage, but it does mean that if you decide to pick this game up, you may get a lot more out of it than you couldve possibly expected going in.", "date": "September 19, 2022", "grade": "B"}
