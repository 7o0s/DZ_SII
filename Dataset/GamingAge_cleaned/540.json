{"name": "Damascus Gear: Operation Osaka", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/05/damascus-gear-operation-osaka-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "I hadnt realized just how underwhelmed I was by Damascus Gear: Operation Osaka until I went back and read my review of its predecessor, Damascus Gear: Operation Tokyo. While I wouldnt call that game exceptional by any stretch of the imagination, and I certainly wouldnt say that Ive even once thought of it since I played it, in retrospect I have to give that game its due for having a clear vision of what it wanted to be: a game where you and your squad piloted giant mechs around the ruins of Tokyo, fighting other mechs. It wasnt complex, but it wasnt trying to be, either.Operation Osaka also isnt trying to be complex, but thats mainly because it isnt trying to be much of anything. It just sort of is. Rather than piloting a mech around a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, here youre just exploring endless, same-looking dungeons. Occasionally youll stumble across rooms featuring other robots, and then its up to you to blow them all up. You can also scavenge or buy extra parts to help improve your own mech.Like I said, theres really not much here. The weapons all seem kind of similar. Most of the robots just look like they had their palettes swapped. Even the games plot seems lacklustre: youre a mech pilot whos deeply in debt, and you have to fight to pay off those debts. On the one hand, its relatively original. On the other hand, its hardly the kind of thing that makes for an unforgettable story.In this respect, I guess, it mirrors everything else about Damascus Gear: Operation Osaka. Its a fairly forgettable sequel to a game that, really, wasnt all that interesting in the first place. It wont crash your Vita, and I assume that means that your PC or PS4 would be safe as well, but thats pretty much the highest compliment I can pay the game.", "date": "May 2, 2018", "grade": "C+"}
