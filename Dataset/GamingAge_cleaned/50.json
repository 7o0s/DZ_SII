For the most part, they dont do much other than copy their paper-and-pen/pencil counterparts, with a grid and a bunch of letters. Its simple, and even if its not thrilling, it works.Within those limited confines, Fifty Words by POWGI seems relatively revelatory. It recognizes that theres nothing forcing a digital word search to adhere to the usual X by X grid format. Instead, it sends letters off in all directions, and you have to hunt around to find your words. It also takes the neat step of making every letter part of a word, which definitely reduces the time spent hunting and circling.The downside of knowing that every letter is in a word is that it makes the game fairly easy. Its not like word searches are all that hard under most circumstances, but in Fifty Words case, it meant that even when I knew nothing about a topic (say, the moons of Jupiter), I was still able to figure things out by the process of elimination. Given that I was able to solve even the toughest puzzles in under four minutes, and that there are only 60 puzzles on offer, you can see how that would mean that youll probably find yourself finished with the game well before you want to be.But its better to leave people wanting more than to wear out your welcome, right? As a long-lasting time-waster Fifty Words by POWGI may have limited value, but if youre just looking for a neat twist on standard word searches, itll do the trick.", "date": "September 24, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
