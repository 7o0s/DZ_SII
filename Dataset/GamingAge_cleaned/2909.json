{"name": "Where Angels Cry", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/where-angels-cry-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "The good news about Where Angels Cry is that its better than Where Angel Cry: Tears of the Fallen, its sequel that actually predates it on the Switch by a couple of months due to licensing issues. Admittedly, Tears of the Fallen was terrible, so thats not really saying much, but still: its good to take a positive view of things.The bad news? The series may have gone downhill, but Where Angels Cry shows that it wasnt exactly starting at a high point.The main reason that its better than Tears of the Fallen is that its less ambitious. Unlike its sequel, Where Angels Cry opts for mostly static cutscenes, rather than animated ones. The other characters still look horrifying, but you dont encounter nearly as many of them, and their movements are less jerky and creepy. This game also feels shorter, which means you finish it sooner, and the less time you have to spend with a mediocre-verging-on-bad game, the better. So its got those things going for it.The drawback of being less ambitious than a game that was incredibly lifeless  as Tears of the Fallen most definitely was  is that the gameplay in Where Angels Cry verges on comatose. Like its sequel, Where Angels Cry is a hidden object/adventure game, except it doesnt really ask anything of you. You go from room to room picking up objects here and there, but there are no dedicated hidden object scenes, and the objects you do have to find are all incredibly obvious. You stumble across minigames, but again, theyre all very simple, to the point you barely have to do anything.", "date": "August 11, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
