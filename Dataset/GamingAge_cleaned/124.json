{"name": "Super Kiwi 64", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/12/super-kiwi-64-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "A few years ago, we reviewed Toree 3D, a fun 3D platformer whose biggest selling point was that it was a mere 99 cents. Now those same developers, Siactro, are back with Super Kiwi 64, and its triple the price for one less level  it only has eight, compared to nine for Toree 3D. Hows that for inflation?I mean, were clearly not talking about breaking the bank either way. And even if Super Kiwi doesnt offer quite the same value as Toree 3D, thats more because Toree 3D was much too cheap  and besides, there are far worse games in the eShop that ask for a whole lot more than Super Kiwi 64s $3.And, as long as you can stomach that price increase, youll find a game that has quite a bit in common with Toree 3D. Super Kiwi 64 is also very much a love letter to the early days of 3D platforming, all weird colours and sharp lines. Plus, of course, theres the N64 nod right there in its name, so its not as if Siactro are trying to hide their influences. Having said there, there is an argument to be made that Super Kiwi 64 may be closer in spirit to a PS1 game than an N64 title. Much like a few other PS1 homages Ive played lately, theres an undercurrent of weirdness running through here feels more like it calls back to some of the stranger PS1-era games. Super Kiwi 64 features odd symbols hidden in each level, and the music sounds just a little bit off-kilter. None of this represents a massive departure from the developers previous outings, but its still odd enough that you may notice it.", "date": "December 6, 2022", "grade": "B"}
