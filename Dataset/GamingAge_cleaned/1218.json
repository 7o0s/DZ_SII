{"name": "Punch Club", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/01/punch-club-review-pc/", "text": "I spent a bit of time with Punch Club on PC this weekend, after its early release stemming from a successful Twitch Plays marketing run last week. So far Ive found it to be pretty unique, generally charming, and at times a bit frustrating. Its a little too grindy for my tastes, but I think Ill stick with it since it really doesnt take a great deal of concentration to get through. This isnt a review, per se, but more a collection of my thoughts after dumping a handful of hours into the fighting sim.Thats right, Punch Club is a fighting simulator. If youre like me when I heard this term, youre probably thinking, what the hell is a fighting sim? Well, Ill attempt to explain. In Punch Club youll guide your characters actions throughout the day, which can consist of working out, eating, sleeping, working and fighting. Theres some side activities thrown in, but these are the major activities youll be focused on.Everything you do in the game takes up a certain amount of time, so youll need to manage your activities and plan out a schedule in order to be efficient. Again, this isnt overly complicated, youll generally get the handle on when to work, when to fight, when to train and so on. Sleeping and eating are generally dictated by when your character runs out of energy or gets hungry, which will prevent you from doing anything until you satisfy either of those issues.This all revolves around when your characters next fight is scheduled, which is generally over the span of three or two in-game days. Ideally, at fight day, youll want to have pushed your strength, agility, and stamina stats as high as possible before the fight, so youre performing at peak levels. Its unrealistic to focus on all three stats when working out, so generally you try to build up one, and maintain some sort of decent level for the other two. This becomes challenging since those stats degrade when a day completes, so theres always some sort of push and pull going on, which is again where the time management aspect becomes important.The developers have struck a pretty good balance with the gains and losses that each day can bring, but progress can feel minimal at first. You have to become accustomed to losing matches, which will definitely happen, but can still provide some benefit. Every fight you complete, whether you win or lose, will earn you skill points, which can then be used to unlock specific abilities or attacks on an ever expanding skill tree. These abilities are also tied into your overall strength, agility, and stamina levels, so depending on which of the three you decide to focus on, your skill tree path will reflect that specialty.", "date": "January 12, 2016", "grade": "B"}
