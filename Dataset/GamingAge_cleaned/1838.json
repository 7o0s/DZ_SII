Simply put: this game is a massive rip-off. Its $20, and for that you get a whopping four levels, which include around fifty puzzles or so (in total, that is, not in each level), most of which can be beaten in a minute or two. It also includes a few extra bits and pieces of content  a soccer game that requires four controllers, some challenges that are basically repackaged bits of the main game, and a couple of harder modes  but nothing that really adds substantially to the experience.Dont get me wrong, what little content the game has is generally enjoyable. The puzzles may not be that difficult, but at the same time, theres something wonderfully ego-boosting about tearing through room after room. Not only that, I really liked how the puzzles were designed to accommodate different ways of thinking; there were several times where I thought I was stuck and looked up the solution on YouTube, only for the answer to make other, simpler solutions seem blatantly obvious.But at the same time  and I really cant emphasize this enough  you can beat the game in a couple of hours. Id say it took me about two and a half to beat the game playing by myself, maybe three if Im being generous. Considering Tiny Brains is designed for multiplayer co-op, I suspect that the actual time required to beat it if youre playing as Spearhead Games intended/are a lot more competent than I am is even lower than that. None of the puzzles are that challenging (except for the excruciating ball-rolling levels), and the game doesnt get noticeably harder the further in you get. It starts off easy and it mostly stays easy to the end, up to and including the absurdly simple boss battle.Which isnt to say Tiny Brains is completely devoid of frustrating bits. As I said, there are a few ball-rolling levels that will probably drive you crazy on account of how unpredictable the balls can be (to say nothing of how much harder these levels are compared to the rest of the game). Additionally, if youre playing solo, then expect to get annoyed every so often by how quickly youre expected to switch between characters  its rarely anything that requires twitchy fingers, but there are one or two places where you have to think and act quickly.", "date": "December 12, 2013", "grade": "C+"}
