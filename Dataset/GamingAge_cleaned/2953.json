{"name": "Saints Row IV: Re-Elected", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/06/saints-row-iv-re-elected-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Saints Row IV is easily one of my all-time favourite games. I loved it when it first came out on PS3, I loved it when they re-released it on PS4, and Ive always thought theres a good argument to be made that its one of the best superhero games ever made. Couple that with the fact I enjoyed Saints Row: The Thirds Switch port, and you can see why I was eager to play SRIV on Nintendos handheld, too.But thisthis is a tough version of the game to love.Dont get me wrong, when Saints Row IV on the Switch works, it works just fine. This is the same game that graced the current and previous generations of PlayStation and Xbox, so all the things I loved about the game on those platforms, I also love here. Its gloriously silly, with dubstep guns and super speed and side missions where you get tanks and blow everything up. The game sets you loose in a alien computer simulation of the Saints beloved Steelport, and gives you everything you need to wreak insane havoc.The thing is, it doesnt work a good chunk of the time. I had to redo the games first mission once because it crashed the first time through. Then it somehow got worse in the second story mission, when it got stuck on a loading screen twice, and crashed entirely another time on top of that. The third mission? Another eternal loading screen that required I quit out of the game entirely and redo the mission from the beginning.In other words, it took me well over an hour (and possibly more than two hours) to play something that shouldve taken maybe thirty minutes, at the outside. No matter how much I love making things explode, thats unacceptable. To be fair, after that, the game managed to go another hour or so without breaking down entirely, but only kind of broken isnt exactly a glowing endorsement.Compared to that issue  that is, the fact that the game really struggles to run when you ask it to do something like saving, or loading a new screen  my other issues with this version of SRIV seem like minor quibbles. Firing your weapons isnt as smooth as I remember it being  but given I spent all my time simply running at enemies and then hitting them with wrestling moves, that didnt bother me too much. I was also kind of weirded out by how my character looked  any time the game zoomed in on her face, not only did her skin look oddly-textured, I felt like I was looking at flesh-coloured blobs stuck on a polygon face model. This feeling intensified during a scene when my character was running around naked (with blurs hiding the appropriate bits, of course), and you could see the weird skin-like texture was everywhere.", "date": "June 19, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
