The objective: dont touch anything. Or, alternatively, do touch things, and risk facing the apocalypse. It wasnt a complicated premise, nor was it a long game, but Please Dont Touch Anything managed to get an impressive amount of mileage  and humour  from that basic scenario.Dont Touch This Button is the same basic set-up as Please Dont Touch Anything, just worse in almost every way.For one thing, its not nearly as smart or as funny as it seems to think it is. Rather than asking players to solve increasingly lengthy, complicated, bizarre puzzles, Dont Touch This Button sticks you in a room and prominently displays how not to solve the puzzle right on a giant screen. The twist/joke  which reveals itself immediately and then serves as a template for the other 59 levels, so this is hardly spoiler territory  is that you just do the opposite of whatever it displays, and you easily move on to the next level.To be fair, theres the odd level where you need to think a little more. Some require codes, for example, that may call for a bit of logical thinking, while others require some trial-and-error as the ground beneath your feet disappears after you step on it. Such levels, however, are few and far between.Theres also a boss fight at the end that kind of comes out of nowhere, as you fight against a giant computer. It kind of comes out of nowhere, its nothing like anything else in the entire game, and it doesnt really add anything to any of it.Obviously, Dont Touch This Button is hampered by the fact that other games have mined very similar territory, and done the same kind of thing much better. If this were a world where none of those games existed, Dont Touch This Button might have more to recommend it, but as it stands, you should probably just play those games instead.", "date": "November 17, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
