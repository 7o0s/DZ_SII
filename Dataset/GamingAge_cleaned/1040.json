{"name": "Bound", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/08/bound-review-ps4/", "text": "Its pretty telling that the two previous games from Bounds developers were Linger In Shadows, which was basically a PS3 tech demo, and Datura, which was designed to showcase the capabilities of the PlayStation Move. In both cases, it seems fair to say that gameplay took a back seat to the developers interest in seeing what they could do with the hardware they were working with.Bound is less experimental than either of those other games. Its coming relatively late in the PS4s lifecycle, at a time when the systems capabilities are more or less known. Moreover, its a relatively linear experience; this is a platformer at heart, even if the character youre guiding from Point A to Point B moves in a distinctly non-traditional fashion.However, even if Bound doesnt push any boundaries (pardon the unintentional pun), theres still an overarching sense here that its trying to be a little different, that its very clearly aiming itself at that games-as-art niche. You progress the plot by moving a progress woman along a beach, pausing her every so often so that she can open up her notebook and see sketches that turn into levels. Your vaguely humanoid character confronts equally vaguely humanoid monsters, and defeats them via the power of dance. You prance and trot and dive and swoop through a constantly shifting world, tumbling along beams and through squares and triangles, jumping from vaguely-defined platforms that are prone to suddenly vanishing, hoping that you dont fall into roiling masses of shapes and colours.The problem is, none of it is particularly interesting. The levels  limited in number though they may be  start to feel interchangeable pretty quickly. If youve tumbled through one field of wavy, papery-looking grasses, youve tumbled through all of them. There are only so many times that platforms can vanish beneath your feet for no apparent reason before it starts to get old quickly. While theres no denying that the main characters movement looks tailor-made for screenshots (more on that in a moment), theres a disconnect between the way it looks and the way it feels to actually control it  which is to say, it may look flowing, but it still feels like youre pushing her through molasses. It doesnt help at all that certain spots require you to dance if you want to get through them, but dancing slows you down to a crawl.Of course, if Bound wants to be art more than it wants to be a game, none of this is a problem. As I said, the main characters movement looks gorgeous. It looks like a gymnastics routine spread out across a world, as streamers are constantly flying and fluttering around our heroine. And, of course, on an aesthetic level, theres something pleasing about the way the whole world is constantly shifting and warping. Throw in music that complements this lovely world perfectly, and, as I said, on an artistic level, this game succeeds beyond a shadow of a doubt.", "date": "August 26, 2016", "grade": "C-"}
