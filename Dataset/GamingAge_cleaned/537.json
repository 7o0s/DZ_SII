{"name": "Semispheres", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/05/semispheres-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "Theres something about Semispheres that makes it seem like it was tailor-made for handhelds. While I havent played the PS4 or PC versions, if theyre anything like the game that was released on the Vita, it feels like itd be too short and too simplistic to fully enjoy on a console. At the same time, it requires a little too much precision to fit in on your phone. So: the Vita and, presumably, the Switch are a perfect home for the game.The key here  and what separates Semispheres from something youd find in the App Store  is that the game is built around twin thumbsticks. Youre manoeuvring two little glowing orbs around small areas on a splitscreen, trying to help both reach their respective goals while avoiding searchlights that send them back to the beginning of the level. You can play around with sounds to try and deceive the searchlights, but really, the core of the game is how dexterous you are with both of your thumbs, occasionally at the same time. (Its harder than it sounds, and it would be practically impossible to pull off on a touchscreen.)If youre looking for depth or replayability, theres not too much of it here. Once youve beaten a level, thats it  theres no point going back and trying for a faster time. There is a bit of a story (something about a boy and his robot), but its fairly inconsequential, and it will neither help nor hinder your enjoyment of the game.There are some minor annoyances here and there. Occasionally a spotlight will happen to catch one of the blobs on the spot where it regenerates, and the level will get stuck in a loop until you manually restart it. Theres also the odd puzzle where it feels like the game is expecting you to be a little more dexterous than is physically possible  but were talking about a puzzle game here. If there wasnt a bit of a challenge here and there, it wouldnt be worth picking up.And Semispheres is definitely worth picking up on a handheld. Its not going to change your life or anything, but it will undeniably give you a few hours of pleasant puzzling.", "date": "May 7, 2018", "grade": "B"}
