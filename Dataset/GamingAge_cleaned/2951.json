Its everything youd expect from one of these games  pixel graphics, chiptunes soundtrack, fairly basic controls  with literally nothing else new or different added in.You want to know specifics? Well, you have a pair of playable characters  the eponymous pals  and they each have their own powers. Kylee can punch, and Owen can fly thanks to a beanie propeller. Thanks to that propeller, Owens levels tend to be a little more vertical, but even then, were talking about a game where all the levels take place in a castle, so its not like theres a lot of variety.Around each level youll find all kinds of enemies and environmental hazards that look like theyve come straight from an NES-era Mario game. The ghosts are the most egregious example, but the fireballs are a close second. I will note that the ghosts arrival  around level 19, right after your Platinum trophy pops  mark Castle Pals transformation from your standard platformer to one thats a little bit tougher, since they require you to make a few more leaps (or, I guess, flights) of faith.Even then, though, its not like Castle Pals changes into something weve never seen before. As I said, its the same as countless games that have come before it. If you like those other retro platformers, this one will probably be up your alley, but dont expect anything you havent seen many times before.", "date": "June 22, 2020", "grade": "C"}
