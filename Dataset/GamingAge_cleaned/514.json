Like.its a word search game. Im going to assume that, conservatively, at least 99% of everyone reading these words has, at some point in their life, done a word search, and, as such, has an opinion on whether or not like they like doing them. Just take that opinion, and extrapolate it out to how youd feel about doing word searches on your Switch.I guess its good (or bad, depending on your point of view) that Word Search by POWGI faithfully recreates that feeling of searching for words in a grid. It would, after all, be pretty astonishing if Lightwood Games found a way to screw up that most basic of tasks. It seems like one of those things that would be impossible to screw upbut at the same time, Ive seen how games like Scrabble and Jeopardy! have been completely butchered, so being able to faithfully recreate the simple joys of a word search counts for a lot more than youd think.Plus, Word Search by POWGI offers you a multiplayer option. Who among us has never done a word search, and thought to themselves, This would be so much better if I was doing this with friends!? I mean, I never have, but if I had, I suppose it would be nice to know I had that option.Obviously, Im not going to be all hyperbolic and claim that Word Search by POWGI is a GOTY candidate or anything. Its a solid game, and nothing more than that. But sometimes, solid is good  particularly if youre a word search fan and youre just looking to to have 300+ puzzles on your Switch. Its not going to wow anyone, but it does what it sets out to do.", "date": "June 5, 2018", "grade": "B"}
