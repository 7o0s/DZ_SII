{"name": "Pinball FX3 Williams Pinball Vol. 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/01/pinball-fx3-williams-pinball-vol-2-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc/", "text": "Zen Studios continues their effort to bring the real life pinball tables of the Williams/Bally license to life with their second pack of tables on the Pinball FX 3 platform. Just like the first pack, this features three tables with the standard bells and whistles weve seen on the platform to date. That includes enhanced digital effects, multiplayer support, online leaderboards, and the general shell of the Pinball FX 3 system, which includes experience and leveling up gains for your overall profile. Also, just like the first Williams/Bally pack, this set of tables is really well done. The set features fan favorites like Attack from Mars, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed The Party Zone, which is not a table I was familiar with prior to playing this release. Also included is the pirate themed Black Rose, another carry over from the The Pinball Arcade. Once again the new physics model that Zen Studios has incorporated for these tables feels great, with fast, fluid gameplay and actual weight behind the ball itself. The lighting models for the tables are outstanding, and each table really pops, looking as close to the real thing as youre likely to get.All three tables in this pack are worth trying out too. Attack from Mars is a classic, with unique UFO/Martian visuals, plenty of toys on the board to interact with, and its a table even beginners can feel pretty comfortable with. Black Rose has a neat cannon mechanic, with a bottom center cannon that loads up with the ball, and youll be required to fire shots at various targets, culminating in a final broadside shot to the giant ship painted on the back of the table playing field. Finally, The Party Zone, which incorporates visuals from other party themed pinball tables, and has a spinning head named Capt. B. Zarr that rotates around to keep an eye on the ball. You can also hit a trigger on the table that allows you to select music to play, including The Whos Pinball Wizard. Seriously, it quickly became one of my favorites in the collection thus far, and Id say its worth picking up this pack for The Party Zone alone. Theres not a lot else to say about the overall product that I didnt mention in my review of the first pack. Now that were past the introduction phase of the transition from The Pinball Arcade to Pinball FX 3, I think its safe to say the license is at least in good hands here. Zen has done an excellent job so far in bringing these tables to life, and theyve all played and looked amazing. Im really looking forward to seeing more tables in the near future, and hope Zen will continue rolling out new sets at a similar pace.", "date": "January 17, 2019", "grade": "A"}
