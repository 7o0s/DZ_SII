{"name": "Marvels Avengers", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/09/marvels-avengers-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "Nearly a year ago I attended a press hands-on event with Marvels Avengers (which I will be abbreviating to just Avengers throughout this review). Going into the session, I didnt know what to totally expect. Was it going to be similar to the Arkham series? More like Tomb Raider due to Crystal Dynamics developing? Or something completely different. Leaving the event, I didnt know what to really compare Avengers to; was it more like Destiny mixed with Spider-Man? Having now finished the single player campaign and a bit of the end game multiplayer, Im still struggling to definitively say what Avengers really is trying to do and which game its most akin to. Word of warning, I will include some very minor spoilers in this review, but nothing more than is already revealed in the open beta that was offered last month on all consoles.Marvels Avengers has been a long time coming since Square Enix acquired the rights in January of 2017, and Im not sure it lives up to the expectations of movie fans, comic fans or video game fans. Expectations is a key word for this review. I came in with expectations as a fan of all of the previously mentioned fandoms as well as expectations based on my hands-on experience last year and what some other outlets were reporting. At the end of the day the game did/does not play out at all like I expected it to, for better or worse. Lets start at the beginning, with the main menu when you first start it up. Youre immediately told that you should play through the single player campaign before jumping into the Avengers Initiative multiplayer mode because it contains story spoilers. This confused me as I planned on playing the game with some friends and again based on my previous hands-on and beta play I expected to be able to jump right in with some friends and begin to level up together and play through the story.This disappointed me right from the get-go, so I had to play the campaign, mostly solo (more on this later), then hope that my friends have completed the campaign as well and are ready to play the multiplayer thats offered following it. Chances of that are pretty slim with the friends I have that currently game. I almost envisioned this Tom Clancys The Division-esque experience where we could drop in and out of each others games and use the mission selection (war table) to jump between missions from the story and/or side quests. Now you can do that, but its all after the recommend you play the single player campaign first, and I just dont see many of my friends playing the nine or so hour campaign then continuing to grind with me to see what aspects of the story they tidy up after the game. Having played through the campaign and some of the multiplayer like I referenced early, I can tell you the campaign has a very cool story, centered around Kamala Khan (who provides a ton of heart and soul into this game). However, this is essentially a nearly 10 hour tutorial to get you up to speed as to how all the launch characters play, the character skill trees, the gear, the challenge cards, yada, yada, yada You see theres a lot of stuff to go through, so they have you learn all of these gameplay mechanics throughout the campaign, then youre ready to go into the true multiplayer and decide who to build up and who to make your main (surprisingly I leaned towards Iron Man).Now saying the campaign is TOTALLY single player is actually wrong, there are sprinkles of missions that you can perform with friends or via matchmaking, but it makes for an uneven experience. These handful of missions arent all made available at once and youll find you can do one or two then have to do the single player only mission to progress the story to unlock a few more team based missions. I get the whole process, teaching you the systems as I laid out before and also unlocking the launch roster as you play through the campaign, and maybe its just me, but I expected a very different experience. Also, Im sure you noticed me mentioning the launch roster a couple times so far in the review; thats because Square Enix has made a strong point to let everyone know that the playable roster will expand over time and all new characters and missions will be free. That kind of support is a great help in pitching people to pick up the game and hang around as new characters and story is added, but it hasnt come without some controversy.Prelaunch we were given some news of characters that are to be added after release, such as Hawkeye and Kate Bishop, and also told that Spider-Man would be added as well but only for the PS4/PS5! So, arguably one of the most popular comic book characters of all time would be behind Sony exclusivity and not a time based deal, exclusive indefinitely this really irked me. Despite being a player of all consoles and reviewing this release on PS4 (code provided by Square Enix for review), this move just seems totally wrong to me. Theyre basically telling consumers buying on the Xbox and PC that youre not going to get the full Avengers experience and that you should know that before spending your hard earned money on the game and the in-game microtransactions (oh yes, I havent forgot about these). Now I understand that Sony has some deal for Spider-Man, based on the Spectacular (see what I did there) Insomniac title from 2018 (and this has nothing to do with movie rights) and that would have seemed like a likely reason for this exclusivity, except for the fact that Spider-Man and his universe of characters all appeared in last years Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, which was a Nintendo Switch exclusive! While Im sure Ill check out the Spider-Man content on Avengers when its released, it is going to fragment the audience, no doubt. PC and Xbox players wont get to play that mission content and there goes the possibility of cross console play, its really just not ideal.Now onto the dreaded microtransations and how to even explain them. Like I mentioned before there are a ton of resources you collect in this game and one of them, Credits, is also purchasable via real money. While people immediately throw their hands up when they hear of these practices on a full price release, there is some hope when it comes to the Avengers. In-game for each playable character you have whats called the Challenge Card. I compare the Challenge Card with another game Im playing a lot of lately and also has a Marvel crossover currently; Fortnites Battlepass. So currently the launch characters each have a Challenge Card, and to progress the Challenge card for each character (theyre all separate, unlike Fortnites Battlepass) you must complete daily and weekly challenges. The weekly challenges are worth more than the daily challenges, obviously. Once you complete a few of these you will start to progress that characters Challenge Card, which offers unlocks for gear, title cards, emotes, finishers, skins and even the Credits. So you can earn a maximum of 1300 Credits for each of the 6 launch characters. Now those can be spent in the in-game marketplace for more exclusive title cards, emotes, skins, etc.Ok deep breath did everyone get all of that? So at the end of the day; the marketplace puts up that glorious Silver Centurion armor for Iron Man for 1400 Credits and you know you gotta buy it. If you havent been doing your challenge cards for each character, youre going to have to pay out of pocket for that skin with real mullah. I respect that the option to earn the currency is given in-game, but I struggled to get rolling with the daily and weekly challenges for a couple of the characters. I chalk it up to the fact that these are meant to really be done in the Avengers Initiative, after the campaign is done, so I wont judge it too harshly. It wouldnt hurt to give a few more challenges per day though, as currently its limited to two per character. I should also mention, remember those free DLC characters being added post launch? Well theyre coming and to use them and their missions is definitely free, but if you want to play through each of their Challenge Cards, youre going to need to web up $10 or 1000 Credits. Time will tell how this all shakes out, but this could become controversial like the microtransactions from Battlefront 2, which is also a Disney owned property.Wow all that and we havent even went into gameplay yet. So Avengers to me plays a bit like Ultimate Alliance crossed with Insomniacs Spider-Man. You have your heavy and light attacks, dodge, jump, and then unique special moves that are limited. These special moves take time to recharge and are some of the cooler attacks in the game. With the specials youll call upon the Bifrost, Don the Hulkbuster, and Embiggen among other abilities. The combat is silky smooth and probably the best part of the game, its an awesome feeling mowing through enemies with Mjolnir, slinging Caps shield, or planting drones with Repulsors. I just wish it didnt end up getting so repetitive, theres a handful of sneaking missions in the campaign but once youre into the Avengers Initiative I hope youre prepared to just battle waves and waves of teleporting (randomly spawning) baddies. The lack of unique boss battles or enemy encounters really hurts replayability, but more on that later.All the attacks and specials can also be upgraded through the skill tree which like nearly every other game, gives you a skill point each time you level up. Now, leveling up adds some extra confusion as you have a Challenge Card level as I mentioned before, then you have a power level, and finally you have your actual level. Power level is generally used to let you know how prepared you are for a given mission and goes up based on the gear your hero has. Gear is found scattered throughout levels and can also be purchased through in-game stores. Here I was reminded of the little of Destiny I played. Each character has unique gear that unfortunately does not alter the heroes appearance in any way, but it does give certain buffs to attacks, better chances for stuns, quicker recovery, you get the idea. Not only that but the gear itself can be boosted to give it more power, confused yet? I know I sure am. So not only are you finding gear in missions, youre also finding all other kinds of resources used to upgrade these gear. Honestly I couldnt tell you the name of any of these resources, all I know is when a piece of gear said I could boost it, you bet your ass (LANGUAGE) that I boosted it. Personally I have no interest in reading every perk a piece of gear gives, especially when it has no cosmetic change. I see a piece thats more powerful than the one I have equipped and my ratings go up, BOOM, its equipped.Overall, I liked the story more than I expected. While the hero appearances take some time to get used to and some choices are rather odd (yes, Im looking at you, Hank Pym), I could look past it as the voice acting was terrific. The character interactions really worked well also and I was bought in on their bond as the story went on. Having said that, I still think Avengers doesnt come close to Spider-Man, the Arkham games, or even the story of Ultimate Alliance 3. I might be in the minority, but having just a few villains throughout the whole campaign is extremely disappointing, most of who you fight in the first few hours (or already have in the beta). You have the Marvel roster at your disposal, use it! Why am I fighting hordes and hordes of robots, ships, and turrets? Having one main big bad made me feel like they were going for an MCU feel without the MCU rights or character likenesses. For a video game it just doesnt work, you need more variety and more known villains to battle. Now, Square Enix might be holding out on other big name villains as they release the DLC characters and missions, but again as a full price release this is disappointing.", "date": "September 11, 2020", "grade": "C+"}
