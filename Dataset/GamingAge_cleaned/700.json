I do this partly so that I dont copy what other people have to say (either consciously or unconsciously), and partly because theres just something fun about the joy of discovering a game entirely on your own.In the case of Touhou Kobuto V: Burst Battle, however, I had to make an exception. Not because I was lacking in inspiration, but because my initial experience with the game was so terrible, I needed to make sure I wasnt playing it wrong.Turns out: no, Im not, Touhou Kobuto V really is just a bad, bad game.See, while it describes itself as a bullet-hell battle game, the more accurate description would be that its a 3D fighting game. Or, even more accurately, its a 3D fighting game that probably wouldve seemed dated and dull 20 years ago.To put it simply, Touhou Kobuto V is a repetitive, simplistic snoozefest. Whether youre playing the arcade mode or the story mode, things unfold in pretty much the same way: playing as one of nine pretty much interchangeable schoolgirls, you get plopped down in a generic arena, and you pick one of three basic attacks against the other character. Repeat that a bunch of times, and you have the game in a nutshell. Id like to say that the story mode adds some depth, but really, it just adds a tiny bit of plot and some trash-talking, and thats about it.", "date": "October 23, 2017", "grade": "B"}
