{"name": "Just Dance 4", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/11/just-dance-4-review-for-ps3-xbox-360/", "text": "Dance games arent really my style. If I cant solve, shoot, fight or blow up something, I usually stay away. That being said, I can totally see the charm behind Just Dance 4 and why the series is popular. The bubblegum pop soundtrack and crazy neon graphics are something that can suck you in if you let it. Before you know whats happening, you are dancing along with the beat.If youve never played a dance game before, Just Dance 4 makes it simple to dive right in. There are two modes to pick from, Just Dance and Sweat. The first mode is where the bulk of the game is where you and up to 3 others can dance the night away to some catchy tunes. Using the PlayStation Move controller (or Kinect or Wii Remote if you own a Xbox 360 or Wii), which is required to play, you simply mimic the on-screen characters moves. Its actually a lot of fun, especially when you have a full house. The other mode, Sweat, is a sort of dance workout mode. Here you can set a timer for your workout and continuously dance to random songs. Depending on how you do on one song, the game will adjust the next one to either be more intense or to cool you down. Its not as difficult as it sounds to mimic the on screen moves and I was getting perfects left and right and I cant dance to save my life. If you are looking for a dancing challenge, Just Dance 4 wont provide you with any. Its all about getting loose and having fun with friends.The included songs might not be the best line up ever seen, but you might find one or two songs you might like. Not all of the included tracks are great, but it really comes down to personal taste. Since you cannot use your own music library, your only option to find better tracks is to hit the online store and start downloading. As of this writing, there were many to choose from, including PSYs Gangnam Style which is a personal favorite.Visually, Just Dance 4 will not blow you away. The crazy bright lights, neon colors, and weird backgrounds feel more like a Karaoke program found in a night club. Its pleasing to the eye, but the graphics are not what is important with a game like this. The graphics that are on screen are clear and crisp, making following the movements of the dancer strikingly easy.In the end, Just Dance 4 is a simple dance game with not much to offer, other than fun with friends. The only way to fully enjoy it is to grab 3 friends and start dancing like maniacs. You can play by yourself, but the true experience lies with having an audience. Its not going to make you a better dancer, but even if this isnt your type of game, youll have fun while playing.", "date": "November 13, 2012", "grade": "B"}
