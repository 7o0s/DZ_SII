{"name": "DmC: Devil May Cry Definitive Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/03/dmc-devil-may-cry-definitive-edition-review-for-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Considering how much I genuinely enjoyed the original release of DmC: Devil May Cry when it launched back in 2013 for Xbox 360 and PS3, I found myself really looking forward to this Definitive Edition release, which finally comes out this week on Xbox One and PS4. The title Definitive Edition certainly fits here, with the game featuring all the DLC from the original version, plus a whole host of additional features and tweaks that make enough of a difference to warrant checking out DmC once again.To read my thoughts on the original release, which havent changed much over the course of two years, check out my initial review here. I still think some of the platforming can be needlessly problematic, and the need to interrupt the on-screen action with small cutscenes continues to annoy me. But the majority of the technical kinks present in the original console release definitely seem to be worked out in the Definitive Edition of DmC, along with any complaints I had regarding load times. Add to that the addition of 1080p at 60 frames per second, which seems to hold up quite well throughout, and youre left with a crisper, smoother version of Ninja Theorys initial effort.But the spruced up visuals and improved framerate arent the only notable additions. Theres a few new modes thatll entice returning DmC players, with the inclusion of a toggable Turbo mode that increases game speed by 20%. Theres also a hardcore mode that can be selected or unselected for each stage, which tweaks the style system, enemy A.I., and Devil Trigger functionality. Both of these additions make a notable difference from a gameplay perspective, giving a different, and in my opinion better, experience with DmC overall.With the Vergils Downfall DLC being included here, Ninja Theory has also tacked on a new Bloody Palace mode specifically for Vergil and his unique enemies, unlocked after completion of the DLC. Bloody Palace is sort of a pure combat experience within the Devil May Cry world, so having more of that with an additional version of the mode is certainly a plus. Other additional modes include Must Style mode, wherein enemies will only take damage at S rank or better. Theres a new, ridiculously tough difficulty mode called Gods Must Die, and theres also additional online leaderboards for Hardcore Mode along with new costumes, achievements/trophies and even the previous pre-order only bonuses from last-gen.Needless to say, if you even marginally enjoyed the original release of DmC, youll find something new and exciting to check out with the Definitive Edition. For the more hardcore fanbase theres been other tweaks and balance adjustments made to the core game, most of which are admittedly lost on me. But even if youll have a hard time telling the difference between how long it takes to string together an SSS rank combo between the original and now, youll still see a considerable difference in the different modes and improved framerate.", "date": "March 10, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
