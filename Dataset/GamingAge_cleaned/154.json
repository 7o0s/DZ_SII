And seeing as the first Devious Dungeon was basically a Rogue Legacy rip-off, that should tell you that, at the very least, whatever effort went into this games creation doesnt show up on the screen.To be fair, Ill note that, where you didnt have a choice as to your character in Devious Dungeon  you were a knight whether you liked it or not  here you can choose to be a barbarian, a mage, or a rogue. This doesnt change the game all that much, but it means that if you want to do something other than just hack-and-slash your way through dungeon after dungeon, you can. It doesnt drastically change the game or anything, but it does give you a tiny bit of variety compared to that first game.Likewise, Ill also note that Devious Dungeon 2 isnt a bad game. It suffers from a lack of originality, like its predecessor, but if you want a competently-made roguelike platformer, it does the trick.It doesnt do anything more than that, though. Notwithstanding a few new enemies, everything pretty much looks the same as it did in Devious Dungeon. The controls feel the same, though you may notice a slight difference if you play as a rogue or a mage. Loot collecting, levelling up, upgrading your gear  all those things work the same way, too.Theres nothing really wrong with that, I guess. There wasnt anything wrong with the first game, so bringing a If its not broken, dont fix it mentality kind of makes sense. Theres worse things in the world Devious Dungeon 2 could have been, I suppose, but that hardly merits a ringing endorsement.", "date": "June 27, 2019", "grade": "B"}
