This is simultaneously incredibly easy and incredibly difficult to believe.Easy because, at its core, the game is essentially an artsier version of Jetpack Joyride or Flappy Bird. You use one button to flap your little arm-wings, and you increase or decrease your height based on the obstacles in your way. Theres a little more nuance to the gameplay when you factor in the power-ups  some make you spin, some make you multiply in number, and so on  but basically, the gist of the game is so simple, its hard to imagine Badland getting its starting anywhere but mobile.My disbelief comes from the actual execution. While the vast majority of Badland can be played with one button, theres still a small-but-essential part of it that demands you use a thumbstick to maneuver. Not only that, as the game progresses it requires more and more precision  and as great as touchscreen gaming can be in a lot of ways, precision isnt exactly its strong suit. The fact it couldve shined on a touchscreen when it seems so well suited to the Vita (or any other console with buttons) astounds me.Whatever its origins, though, Im glad to play Badland in its current form. The controls strike the right balance between being totally intuitive to pick up, yet incredibly difficult to pull off. This, too, speaks to the games strong level design; most of the time its easy enough to figure out what youre supposed to do, but the challenge comes in actually doing it.Whats impressive is that Badland shines so brightly despite the fact its so unremarkable in other ways. Theres zero attempt at a story or plot, for one thing. Youre just a round little monster with the ability to do some crazy things, and thats about all the context youre going to get. Similarly, the graphics are pretty unremarkable; while Badland looks nice enough, it also exists very much in the post-Limbo space of artsy platformers, and while its undeniably cool that thats been successful enough to distinguish itself as a unique genre, it also means that Badland doesnt stand out visually as it did even a few years ago.", "date": "June 22, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
