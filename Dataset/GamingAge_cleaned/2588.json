Above all else, this game  which brings together a pair of Japan-only games, Great Ace Attorney and its sequel  is different from the more modern-day Phoenix Wright games. Possibly good different, possibly bad different, but unquestionably and undeniably different.The biggest difference is probably the tone. Even if the games protagonist, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is Phoenix Wrights ancestor, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles isnt anywhere near as over-the-top as the Ace Attorney games that so many people know and love. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles may have some characters and moments of levity, but the game is set in the late 1800s, at a time when Japan was transforming from a feudal kingdom into a more modern nation  and, not coincidentally, seeing a rise in English influence.I mention that because this transformation is at the heart of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. The game spends a lot of time explaining post-feudal Japanese society, as well as its relationship with England, and the game takes place in both countries. Further, that relationship underlies some of the cases youre tasked with solving here  there are all kinds of political and cultural shifts happening in the background, and they inform several of the major plot points here.On that note, Ill also highlight that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles feel much, much more exposition-heavy than your usual Ace Attorney games. How much more? Ill put it this way: theres a Story mode option here that allows you to turn off your inputs and choices, and just allows you to watch everything unfold. While I wouldnt say that the game quite crosses the line from however youd classify the Phoenix Wright games (courtroom adventure games?) to straight-up visual novel, it definitely comes very close to that line at times.That said, there are still plenty of courtroom and investigation elements if youre patient enough to wait out the lengthy exposition  though they may be a little different than what the series has done so far. Building on that English influence, there are several points here where youre not just trying to convince a judge, but also a jury.On top of that, the game takes advantage of its setting by introducing another character  Herlock Sholmes, whos pretty much exactly who he sounds like. The difference between Sholmes and Doyles creation, however, is that while both love their deductions, Sholmes are wrong more often than not, and its up to you to correct them. Even if this new mechanic finds the game branching out into uncharted territory, if youre looking for something that captures the zany spirit of the mainline Phoenix Wright games, thats arguably the closest The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles comes.In other words, even if The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles has Ace Attorney right there in its name, its not the Ace Attorney that you may be expecting. This game finds the series branching off into a new and different direction, and as I said up top, its not inherently good different or bad different, just different-different.", "date": "August 2, 2021", "grade": "B"}
