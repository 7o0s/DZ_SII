{"name": "Luigis Mansion 3", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/11/luigis-mansion-3-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Maybe its just because I have Ghostbusters on the brain, but the more I played of Luigis Mansion 3, the more I found myself comparing the two games. And, I mean, why not? Both involve hunting ghosts, both involving destroying all kinds of property, both take place (either entirely or in part) in a hotel. While theyre hardly carbon copies, theyre not not similar, either.Theres one major difference, however: while Ghostbusters (the game, that is) hasnt aged so well, Luigis Mansion is an absolute gem, one of the best experiences the Switch has to offer and easily one of my favourite games of the year.There are one or two minor issues that can be addressed  and dismissed  right off the bat. The controls, for example, are occasionally a little awkward when youre trying to focus Luigis flashlight on any specific object. Thankfully, that can quickly be fixed by enabling motion controls, so its just a matter of tilting your Switch  this marking the one and only time Ive ever been grateful for motion controls. Theres also a brief moment whenever Luigi is in an elevator that the graphics dont look as great as they do in the rest of the game. Its not a massive difference, but it was something I noticed every single time I had Luigi in an elevator and I went through that de facto loading screen.Other than that, though? Luigis Mansion 3 is absolutely phenomenal.Some of this is because the formula is so simple, its incredibly easy to get sucked in. Luigi and friends visit a hotel that turns out to be haunted, said friends (Peach, Mario, and various Toads) get trapped by some nefarious plot, and Luigi has to free them all while trapping ghosts at the same time. And thats it  you have clear motivations leading to a straightforward story, and you never get bogged down by stupid twists and turns. Youre there to capture ghosts, and the game never tries to get in your way.Thats helped, of course, with controls that are incredibly easy to pick up (especially once you enable motion controls), and that, somehow, never get old despite the fact youre basically doing the same thing  zap the ghosts with your flashlight, sucking them into your ghost-vacuum, and slamming them into the ground until they lose all their health  over and over again.Another big plus to the game is the addition of Gooigi, a version of Luigi stored in his backpack made  as his name suggests  entirely of goo. With him, youre able to walk through grates, arrows, and other environmental hazards and obstacles. More importantly, it always you to duplicate Luigi to deal with some particularly pesky challenges that require cooperation. As someone who only plays single-player (and who doesnt even know anyone whod be interested in taking advantage of Luigis Mansion 3s multiplayer), this spoke to me.Any discussion of Luigis Mansion 3 would also be incomplete without a discussion of the levels. Theres a nice variety to the different floors of the hotel here, with different themes that allow the game to stretch its conceit far beyond simply having Luigi exploring a haunted hotel. The game doesnt bind itself to simply having hallways and rooms, and instead throws in things like an enormous greenhouse (for lack of a better description) with plants that rise for several floors, or a castle that comes complete with a battle arena. They all look great, too, with all the care, polish, and attention youd expect from a Nintendo game.And really, thats what makes Luigis Mansion 3 so wonderful: its clear that a lot of care, polish, and attention went into making it. It looks fantastic, it plays even better, and its simply a joy to play from beginning to end.", "date": "November 7, 2019", "grade": "A"}
