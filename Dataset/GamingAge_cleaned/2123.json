As of this writing, Wordle is free to play on the New York Times site and elsewhere. That makes the value proposition of Wordbreaker a little difficult to see. I mean, yes, you get to play the game on your Switch, but this is taking the idea of a Nintendo tax to an extreme degree.As for the unlimited guesses, that speaks to Wordbreakers bigger issue: its kind of boring. One of the great things about Wordle is the tension that comes with only having six guesses to figure out the word. If youve played Wordle, you know what its like to hit that fifth guess and still not know what the word is. In Wordbreaker, by contrast, you just keep on guessing until you get it, and the only challenge is whether you can finish each puzzle in under a minute.In fact, its worth noting that Wordbreaker actually removes a lot of the challenge by not allowing repeated letters in words. Even if youre not a fan of how Wordle suddenly has a lot more of those words post-NYT move, they at least keep things interesting.Without them  and without anything else to push you  its really makes it difficult to stay interested in the game. There are ways to play around with the Wordle formula to make the gameplay fresh and new (see Octordle for an extreme example), but theres none of that to be found in Wordbreaker.", "date": "March 28, 2022", "grade": "C"}
