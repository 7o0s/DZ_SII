Of course, as always, Id like to avoid spoilers as much as possible here, but I will say that this entry provides some strong forward momentum for the storyline. Were introduced to new characters, exploring new locations, and quickly learn that the reveal at the end of episode 2 isnt nearly as cut and dry as it seems.Im still enjoying my romp through the Fables universe as Bigby, and Im really digging the noir undercurrent that runs throughout these episodes. This isnt quite Double Indemnity, but its a strong bit of video game fiction that is immensely satisfying to watch as it unravels. Typical gameplay complaints still hold true here however, and I think between this and the second season of The Walking Dead, its high time that Telltale attempt to change up the formulaic nature of both games. I imagine that wont happen until both titles wrap up their respective storylines, but I sincerely hope to see something a bit different for Game of Thrones or Borderlands.I will say that this third episode has a really solid ender, finally allowing Bigby to unleash in a way we havent seen since the Grendel encounter. It actually surpasses that moment in viciousness, depending on the choice players make. I certainly like playing as Bigby, more than any other Telltale character to date, simply because the choices and actions afforded to him are so fitting for his character regardless of what dialogue box you choose. You can really mold his story in a way thats believable across all options, something that I cant say felt entirely true for Lee or Clementine in The Walking Dead.I also really love the comic book visuals, which fit the original world and character designs so well. The ample use of dirty neon lights and the synth driven soundtrack that drives home the 80s era setting remains consistent here, building up the Fables world in a way that feels cinematic and true to the overall design of the game. I really feel like every piece of this game  dialogue, characters, choices, setting, soundtrack and visuals  mesh together so well that they elevate each other in a way that few titles manage to do.", "date": "April 11, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
