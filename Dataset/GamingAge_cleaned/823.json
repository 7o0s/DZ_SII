{"name": "Echo Generation", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/09/echo-generation-review-for-xbox/", "text": "I feel like there are two ways to look at Echo Generation: either its far better than it has any right to be, or its a disappointment thanks to some unfortunate gameplay choices. It really depends on whether youre a glass half-empty or half-full kind of person, and how forgiving you feel when youre looking at the game.Either way, Echo Generation definitely has some good things going for it. Its graphics are gorgeous, for starters, with some of the nicest voxel graphics youre likely to come across. To some extent it gives the game a Minecraft-y feel (or Minecraft Dungeons, if you want to be more specific), except far, far nicer than that. Theres an incredible amount of detail in everything you see, and it makes the world come alive.The game also finds a way to be built around 80s and 90s nostalgia without being overly beholden to it. Taking a page from Stranger Things, Echo Generation is about a bunch of kids exploring the supernatural, and while the setting is clearly from a few decades ago, it never allows the setting to be the point. It builds on it; like the visuals, you can tell a lot of care went into putting the story together.Ive even got to say nice things about the games turn-based combat. Usually I dont care for turn-based battles, but Echo Generation is an exception to that. The different characters have a nice range of attacks at their disposal, and they require a little more skill than what this combat system often demands. Its a good way of keeping you engaged in whats going on.At least, it is at first. One of the problems with Echo Generation that I alluded to up top is that it eventually demands a lot of grinding. Its not too onerous at first, since your characters seem to level up quickly enough, but as the enemies start getting tougher, you have to spend more and more time going back and fighting the weaker ones just to stand a chance. It gets to the point where it distracts from the story, which is never a good thing.Similarly, there are a lot of fetch quests in this game  and, unlike the grinding, its not something that takes awhile to show itself. Right off the bat, the game charges you with finding a traffic cone to get your sister to help you on your journey, and that leads to more and more tasks being piled up, nearly all of them interconnected in some way. It takes away from the story, as you end up spending more time searching around for random items than keeping the plot moving along at an enjoyable pace.", "date": "September 9, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
