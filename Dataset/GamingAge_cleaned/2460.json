That studio, after all, was founded by former Rare developers, and the first two games they published were Yooka-Laylee and Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair. Much like those games were love letters to 2.5D and 3D platformers from days gone by, Demon Turf feels very much like a game that couldve come out about 25 years ago.In fact, Id probably go even further than that, and say that its hard to imagine how the game could feel any more 90s. Everything  from the visuals, to the humour, to the soundtrack, to the gameplay  feels like it could have come straight out of that decade.Thats not necessarily a compliment. While the concept of 2D characters and environments in a 3D world is neat, its also pretty ugly. Given that Demon Turf features, er, demons and is set in hell, a lot of that ugliness is intentional, so your feelings on it will come down to aesthetic preference  but personally, I just found it a pain to look at.It didnt help matters, either, that much of the world was covered in a smoggy haze. Maybe this was to hide technical limitations, maybe it was meant to be an homage to the games from which its drawing inspiration, but whatever the case: the end result was still unpleasant.The music, too, sounds like a late 90s invention. While I dont inherently hate that, there are only so many times you can hear record scratches before it all gets a little grating, and Demon Turf hits that point within its first ten minutes.The most 90s thing about Demon Turf, though, is the gameplay. Its a collectathon, and, well, you collect. Lots of items, scattered all over the games ugly, ugly worlds, which you gather by interacting with its hideous-looking characters, floaty-jumping from platform to platform, occasionally trying to bounce off walls, and engaging in the weakest, most useless combat imaginable. It tries adding a neat wrinkle by giving you the opportunity to set checkpoints by planting flags, except the problem with that is kind of obvious: who stops in the middle of a level to place a flag because you think youre about to die? In levels where you regularly die at the same place over and over again it kind of works, but more often than not, you probably wont think of planting a flag until its much too late.That phrase kind of works really applies to all of Demon Turf. Its got some interesting ideas and interesting visuals, and you can see where the developers were going with it all  but the more you play, the more it all seems like it all only sort of hits the mark. Just about the only way that its fully on-target is in how well it feels like a 3D collectathon from the late 90s, but given there are plenty of games out there from that era  not to mention the past 20+ years  that you can choose from just as easily, Demon Turf feels like itll get lost in the crowd.", "date": "December 24, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
