{"name": "Overland", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/05/overland-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Its kind of weird playing Overland in the current climate. Obviously, when it was developed and released a few months ago, the developers had no way of knowing they were just months away from a global pandemic that would feel quasi-apocalyptic, butwell, here we are, and, thankfully, things havent devolved quite this much. Mind you, Overlands apocalypse seems to involve spiky monsters, and we dont have quite the same thing to worry abo  wait, what? Aww, nuts.Anyway, getting back on track: Overlands creepy atmosphere loses some of its impact for reasons completely beyond its control. But I wouldnt say it loses it entirely. On top of those spiky monsters crawling around every map, you also have to face obstructed views, limited resources, and a sparse score that amps up the tension. Couple that with turn-based gameplay that puts strict limits on what you can do during any move, and this game definitely succeeds at creating a feeling of suffocating tension.The thing is, the way Overland is designed, theres a very thin line between tense and frustrating, and more often than not, it falls on the wrong side of that line. Its similar to isometric puzzle games like Hitman Go or Vandals, where you and your enemies take turns moving around a grid-based board, with your character trying to reach supplies and other survivors as the enemies try to catch you. It doesnt really tell you any of this, though, beyond the barest details, and because every new map is procedurally-generated, youre constantly trying to find your bearings. Theres also very little margin for error, which means that, more often than not, youll wind up dead before you come anywhere close to achieving your objectives.Whats more, because it tells you so little, theres a lot of trial and error here. Controls arent immediately obvious, and with such limited movements within each turn, youre a) mostly figuring it out as you go along, and b) dying a lot.For many people, of course, the difficulty is the point, especially when were talking about survival horror  which, its isometric puzzle trappings notwithstanding, Overland definitely is. It doesnt hold your hand (which, for some  i.e. me  may be a drawback), so if youre tired of the current apocalypse and in the mood for one thats a little different, it might just do the trick.", "date": "May 8, 2020", "grade": "B"}
