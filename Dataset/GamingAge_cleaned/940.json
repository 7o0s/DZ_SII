Then chances are good youll like Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters Daybreak: Special Gigs! this year, for the simple reason that theyre the same game.Okay, technically thats not entirely true. If anything, Daybreak: Special Gigs is just Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters, but more of it. More chapters. More characters. More Battleship-style levels where you have to hunt out hidden ghosts.Really, though, Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters on steroids is still Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters. Just because you have more forgettable characters and more of a bland plot doesnt automatically make it any better; it just means you have more of it.To be sure, the game deserves some credit for sticking with its grid-based battles. Personally, they left me a little cold, but theres still something to be said for not just trying something new, but remaining committed to it. And if you appreciated Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters combat the first time around, then I see no reason why you wouldnt welcome the chance to revisit it.", "date": "December 8, 2016", "grade": "C-"}
