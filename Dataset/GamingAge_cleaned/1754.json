{"name": "King Oddball", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/04/king-oddball-review-ps4/", "text": "Seeing as the PS4 version of King Oddball is exactly the same as the PS Vita version that came out a few months ago, its awfully tempting to just cut and paste my review of King Oddball Vita from February and call it a day. After all, everything I said then still stands now. Its still really fun, and its still got minimal replay value.In the interest of fairness, though, I should probably mention that even if theres zero reason to replay the game after youve finished it, theres still a decent amount of content you have to get through before you reach the end. There may not be any stars or high scores to chase after  you either beat a level, or you dont  but there are 80 or so main levels, plus about twice as many bonus and hidden levels. So even if you wont be spending hours and hours trying to master a level, youll still have plenty to do if you decide to get the game.Of course, thats the big question: is it worth picking up King Oddball for PS4? That depends entirely on whether youve already played it on the Vita. If you have, then  unless youre a Trophy hunter drawn by the allure of a new set of trophies  theres not much reason to play it again. Sure, its a Cross-Buy title, so its basically free, but again: its literally the exact same game, just on a bigger screen (unless, of course, youre playing it remotely on your Vita).", "date": "April 15, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
