Its one of the laziest games Ive ever played: the developers evidently thought of an idea for a game (a western-themed shooter/puzzle game where you have a limited number of bullets), created 30 very short levels based on that idea, and then called it a day.I mean, dont want to diminish the amount of work that goes into a game. Clearly, its more than Ive ever done, and the fact its all in good working order means that Virtuous Western is a cut above some broken games Ive played.But it works is the bare minimum you should expect from a game, and thats really all that Virtuous Western does. Apart from a mildly challenging boss fight for the 30th level, if youve played one of the other 29 levels here, youve played them all. The visuals dont change, the approach barely changes (unless you count needing to shoot some bad guys twice a massive innovation), and the goal never changes. It would be boring, if it werent for the fact itll be done before you know it.Just about the only positive here is that publishers Ratalaika didnt do their usual thing and have the Platinum trophy pop up halfway through the game. Mind you, if they had this wouldve meant giving a Platinum for finishing 15 of the easiest levels imaginable, but still: its progress, of a sort.But even that shouldnt be enough to make anyone bother with Virtuous Western. Its a wisp of an idea thats not even interesting enough to sustain the minimal game thats here, and youre couple of dollars and 20 minutes would be better spent on pretty much anything else.", "date": "January 10, 2022", "grade": "D+"}
