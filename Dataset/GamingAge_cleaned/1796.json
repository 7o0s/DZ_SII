{"name": "Toukiden: The Age of Demons", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/02/toukiden-age-demons-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Monster Hunter. Monster Hunter Monster Hunter Monster Hunter.I just thought Id get that out of the way right off the bat rather than tap-dancing around it for a few paragraphs, because really, thats the giant, elephantine beast in the room when it comes to Toukiden: The Age of Demons. Its the obvious influence, the current occupant of the throne to which Toukiden aspires, the alpha and the omega of the monster-hunting genre  its pretty much impossible to look at Toukiden and not think of it in relation to Monster Hunter.Which isnt to say there arent at least a couple of differences. For one thing, Toukiden has a mythology all its own; it may not be overly complex (youre protecting your village from a demon invasion), but it is there, and Omega Force deserve kudos for that  to say nothing of the way theyve weaved in actual bits of character development and interpersonal relationships.For another, from a technical standpoint, Toukiden stands well above the Monster Hunter games on both 3DS or PSP. It looks far, far nicer, while the advantages imbued by the presence of the Vitas dual thumbsticks are apparent from the very first time you pan around your surroundings on the battlefield.Beyond that, though? Its pretty Monster Hunter-y. Plot notwithstanding, the core of the game is still kill monsters-upgrade gear-repeat. Toukiden may throw in some stuff about captured souls and Rituals of Purification and whatnot, but thats all window-dressing. For the duration of your time with Toukiden, youll be running around battlefields  sorry, Ages  and hacking and slashing demons to death, and thats pretty much all youll be doing. (Though, technically, I suppose that if you go with a different slayer, you could also be arrowing the demons to death, or range-killing them.)", "date": "February 19, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
