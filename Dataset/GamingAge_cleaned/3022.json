{"name": "Knightin+", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/04/knightin-review-for-ps4-ps-vita-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Knightin+ describes itself as a Zelda-lite.Now, there are a couple of assumptions you may make based on that sentence. The first is that its similar to The Legend of Zelda. The second is that, because of the dropped g in the title, this game pokes fun at Zelda-like games. The third is that the lite is there because the game is a rogue-lite.Remarkably, none of these assumptions would be true. Its only like The Legend of Zelda in that, like the first NES games in that series, its top-down and built on 8-bit graphics, but once you get past that, the comparison is a little shaky. Knightin+ has no overworld, and its a series of four dungeons, each a little more difficult with a few more puzzles/enemies/levels than the last. While Zelda had similar elements, the same could go for any number of games from that era that Knightin+ is drawing from.Likewise, calling it a rogue-like is kinda borderline. Its a dungeon-crawler, sure, but theres nothing here procedurally-generated, there are no permadeaths, your progress carries over from one dungeon to the next  I mean, I dont think theres any strict rule about what defines a rogue-lite, but if Knightin+ is just a dungeon-crawler, its just a dungeon-crawler. No need to try and shoehorn it into another genre just for the sake of a catchy genre name.As for whether it pokes fun at Zelda or rogue-likes/rogue-litessure, there are occasionally jokes in the scrolls that unravel after you beat a level, but thats about it. There are probably more jokes in the games trailer than in the game itself, in fact, so if youre hoping for some kind of satirical take on, well, anything, this isnt it.Despite all my complaints about what Knightin+ isnt, Ive still got to say that its a worthwhile game. As someone whos never had much patience for endless dungeon-crawling, the streamlined nature of the game really spoke to me. As Ive written before, when it comes to Ratalaika games, its always a good sign when I keep on playing even after the Platinum Trophy has popped, and thats exactly what I did here, too. It also helps that Knightin+ features cheat codes, which go a long way towards helping you max out your stats and not have to worry about backtracking through the same places over and over again  though, Ill hasten to add, even before I discovered the codes exist, I was still enjoying my time with the game.In other words, if you go into Knightin+ expecting the right things, youll probably get a lot more out of it. Its not ground-breaking in any way, but its a solid game nonetheless, and it offers a fun way to pass a couple of hours (and boost your Trophy count/Gamerscore in the process).", "date": "April 1, 2020", "grade": "B"}
