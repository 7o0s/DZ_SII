{"name": "World War Z", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/12/world-war-z-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "To some extent, theres nothing memorable about World War Z on the Switch. Dustin gave a fairly thorough breakdown of all there is to know about the game back when it first came out on PS4 and Xbox One a couple of years ago, and pretty much everything there was to be said about it was said then.At the same time, though, thats kind of impressive in and of itself. While I wouldnt say that World War Z is the most graphically intensive game out there, its still a game that requires you to slaughter seemingly endless waves of zombies coming at you from all directions. Given that, you might think the Switch would struggle to show it all on the screen without there being some serious slowdown  and yet, it doesnt. No matter how many zombies are scrambling up a wall, the game just keeps on chugging along.Mind you, the end results arent always the prettiest looking. In fact, the game is downright ugly at times, and the zombie horde sometimes looks more like a blurry zombie blob. Still, it works, which is really all you could hope for.Whats more, because it works, the combat feels awfully satisfying  though I think I approached the game very differently than most people. I know that the game is meant to be played as a squad, as Dustin noted, as a none-too-subtle take-off of Left 4 Dead; theres certainly plenty of firepower at your disposal here, whether you want to blow the zombies up, set them on fire, or simply gun them all down. Personally, though, I took a great amount of joy in whacking away at the zombie hordes with my machete, relying on my (surprisingly competent) AI squadmates to shoot any of the excess monsters if their numbers got too great. It wasnt an orthodox way to approach the threat, but it was still fun.And thats the key takeaway from World War Z on the Switch: its fun. It may not be the prettiest game, nor is it the most original, but when youre mowing down row after row of zombies, it more than does the trick.", "date": "December 14, 2021", "grade": "B+"}
