{"name": "Velocibox", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/velocibox-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "To get an idea of what Velocibox is like, just look back to Battletoads infamous turbo tunnels.Got that? Now speed it up significantly. And make it multi-dimensional, so that youre not just avoiding obstacles on one plane, but rather all four. And make the obstacles move in unpredictable ways. And make the levels change each time, so you cant memorize or learn them. And add in one-hit deaths. And add in lots of flashing lights and a throbbing electronic soundtrack, just to make everything seem that much more overwhelming.In other words, the makers of Velocibox essentially took one look at one of the toughest video game levels of all time, thought Pfft, not hard enough, and set out to make something even harder.Okay, it probably didnt happen exactly like that, but it certainly feels that way. Velocibox is hard. Nope, that doesnt even fully cover it: Velocibox is HARD. Super, ridiculously, absurdly, almost unfairly hard. And thats just at the first level. Heck, thats just the tutorial: you get a trophy for getting through it unscathed, which should tell you how hard this game is right off the bat.Note: I did not get that trophy.Now, Im not going to lie: I cant say I enjoyed Velocibox. While I appreciate what its makers were trying to do  make a very simple, very tough game  it starts off with such an insanely high degree of difficulty, its hard to even get into it in the first place. No sooner are you being shown the games basic mechanics (youre controlling a cube hurtling endlessly through a tunnel) than youre dying, and dying, and dying again. Its not like, say, Cosmophony, where you could at least gain the required muscle memory as you gradually slog your way through each level. Nope, here you die right off the bat, and then die again as the game changes things up on you. While that may appeal to some, it does absolutely nothing for me.", "date": "August 6, 2015", "grade": "B"}
