Nothing against Nintendos home console or anything, but when I get addicted to a game, I prefer that it be on a platform I can take with me everywhere. As far as I was concerned, Spy Chameleon and the Vita were pretty much guaranteed to be a winning combination.Imagine my dismay, then, whennah, just kidding. Spy Chameleon on the Vita is almost everything I couldve wished for. Its a stealth game that practically demands you play each of its bite-sized levels over and over again until you get them just right, and the Vitas portability means you can do that everywhere. It runs smoothly, the controls work well, it looks nice  basically, everything you could want out of the game has made the jump to PlayStation, and you get trophies to boot.So why did I qualify that by saying its almost everything? Because, unfortunately, theres one tiny little glitch present, one small problem that irks me every time it pops up. In each of the games 75 levels, you need to grab 10 flies, beat a target time, and find all the ladybugs. The ladybugs dont pop up until youve achieved one of those first two goals. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, whenever I was playing the game on the go  that is, when it couldnt see the online leaderboards  it didnt always realize that Id beaten the target time, meaning I had to do an extra run-through or two in order for it to properly register. It didnt happen all the time, and it never happened when I had an internet connection, but it popped up just enough that it left me feeling the teensiest bit of annoyance towards a game I otherwise loved.Just as you shouldnt let perfect be the enemy of the good, however, you shouldnt let one minor issue get in the way of enjoying an otherwise outstanding game. Like I said before, Spy Chameleons gameplay seems tailor-made for the Vita. Not only are the levels short and contained enough that they translate perfectly to on-the-go gaming, the controls are as intuitive as can be, and everything just runs smoothly. On top of that, it looks fantastic; theres no obvious downgrade from the console versions, and the titular lizard pops off the screen no matter what color it is.", "date": "August 4, 2016", "grade": "A"}
