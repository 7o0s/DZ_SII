{"name": "Woven", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/12/woven-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "I honestly have no idea who Woven is supposed to be for.On the one hand, it seems like its geared towards kids. The world is designed to look like its made out of fabric,  la Yoshis Crafted World or Kirbys Epic Yarn. The main character is Stuffy, a stuffed animal searching for his family and friends, who has a robotic fly sidekick named Glitch. Its got an English narrator to explain the story, which he does so via rhyme. Theres not really anything that could be described as combat, though you do occasionally encounter the oddenemy is probably too strong a term, so lets say mildly antagonistic obstacle. It all feels unthreatening and pleasant, which is why it almost seems like it would be suitable for very young players.And yet, at the same time, its got all kinds of weird design quirks that make me think kids would hate it. The controls are odd  rather than using the face buttons, you hold down one of the shoulder buttons (left for Glitch, right for Stuffy), and then choose an action for the character to perform using the thumbstick. It makes the onscreen action seem like theyre happening at a remove from the player.Even more annoyingly, youre supposed to wander the world, picking up new designs and body parts and swapping them in and out, except swapping is a bit of a pain. You have to find a designated swapping station, ask Glitchy to turn it on, and then choose from the parts youve already uncovered. Woven doesnt always do a great job of explaining when youll need to swap parts, so youll come across a swapping station, and then only find out you were supposed to use it, necessitating a fair amount of backtracking.General exploration is also no fun, on account of the fact that Woven is filled with invisible walls and obstacles. Youll constantly bump up against the edge of where youre allowed to visit, even if you can see the world beyond where youre trying to walk. Stuffy is also regularly stymied by plants, small inclines, and other obstacles that dont seem like they should be all that big a deal. Its particularly infuriating since one of the very first cutscenes of the game shows Stuffy falling from a great height and popping back up again, as the narrator helpfully informs us that Stuffy can take a big bump or two. You never get to see that skill in action, mind you, but youre still told its there, which makes the invisible barriers all the more annoying.Its this last point that has me wondering who the intended audience of Woven is. The first two points in the reasons why this isnt for young kids  that there are lots of specialized body parts to use, and controls that dont seem entirely intuitive  would suggest that, despite the games aesthetics, its secretly designed for older games. At yet, at the same time, the world itself  stunningly beautiful though it may be  is an absolute pain to explore, which means that even more experienced players will want to walk away well before this game is finished.Its really too bad, because any game that looks this cute should be incredibly easy to love. That Woven isnt  indeed, that it becomes fairly grating pretty quickly  is a sign of just how many other problems it has. No matter how adorable the game may look, looks clearly arent everything.", "date": "December 9, 2019", "grade": "C-"}
