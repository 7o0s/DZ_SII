{"name": "The Language of Love", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/12/the-language-of-love-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "I dont expect much from visual novels. Ive played a lot of them over the years  mostly because of my obsession with playing every single game that came out on the Vita  so I know what Im getting into any time I start one up: lots of reading, and occasionally the option to nudge the story in one direction or another. Theyre undemanding, but if thats what you go in expecting, you wont be let down.And yet, somehow, The Language of Love falls well short of that incredibly low bar.Even by the standards of visual novels, theres not a lot here. Yes, it brags about being 80,000 words long, but its absurdly linear. Boy meets girl (well, 23-year-old man meets girl). Boy meets girls mom. Boy babysits while mom works. Boy and mom fall for each other. The end. Theres nothing unpredictable here, nor is there anything very memorable that happens. Theres never any doubt where the story will wind up. The closest this game gets to tension is when the couple and the kid go for a walk in the woods at night, and the kid disappears for a few moments. She shows up moments later unharmed, though, so not even that moment goes anywhere interesting.It doesnt help that the characters are so flat and lifeless. The 23-year-old man is Mitsuki, a guy whos gone back to school and needs a place to live. The female love interest is Kyouko, a 24-year-old single mom. And theres Tama, the six-year-old daughter. None of them are particularly interesting to read about. Kyouko talks about how plain she is and how glad she is to have a babysitter. Tama is precocious. And Mitsuki is kind of prone to doing pervy things like talking about his gaze lingering on Kyoukos chest, and joking about his nose bleeding. Its not exactly a character-driven plot, either.It should come as no surprise that such an undemanding story is equally undemanding in what it asks of players. The Language of Love is the kind of visual novel where, if youre so inclined, you could set it to move forward automatically, and never again have to press another button. (In fact, if you want the easiest, quickest Platinum imaginable, you can also set it to fast-forward through the next, and the Platinum will pop within five minutes.) There are no choices to be made, no branching storylines, no twists  no reason why you might need to pay attention to figure out what to do next. The story starts, the story ends, and theres nothing you need to do in between.As I said, I know that Visual novels arent the most demanding genre, but the good ones still reward you in some way, even if its just with an engaging story. The Language of Love doesnt even have that, which means its very safe to skip it.", "date": "December 23, 2020", "grade": "D+"}
