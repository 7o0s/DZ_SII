You start off the game with a plot of land, and you slowly improve it as you take on and complete more quests, except nearly all of the quests can be boiled down to: clean up this plot of land thats fallen into disrepair. You pick up garbage, you wipe off stains, you light some lamps, and occasionally you carry a box out to your cart  all to a score that sounds vaguely medieval. While theres nothing inherently wrong with that  again, see Train Station Renovation  in this case its just not very fun. Part of this is because of the controls: you basically press R2 to do everything, so the gameplay just consists of walking around looking for things that prompt you to press the button. It starts feeling repetitive pretty quickly, as you might imagine.On top of that, though, Castle Renovator doesnt make it easy on you. Some of the items you need to pick up are tiny, and you need to be focused perfectly on each one of them to ensure theyre picked up. Consequently, youll spend a fair amount of time slowly inching back and forth, trying to find the perfect angle.Even worse, both the visuals and the lighting are awful, and its very easy to overlook your surroundings given how dark everything looks. You unlock a torch early on, but that doesnt help much. Theres also no way to adjust the brightness in the settings menu, so you basically just have to live with the fact you cant see anything for a fair chunk of the game.Unfortunately, Castle Renovator doesnt get any better when you get into the actual building renovations. Fixing up walls, floors, and trebuchets (medieval!) requires picking up a few loose pieces of wood at a time, slowly walking over to where youre fixing, placing them just so, then walking back to pick up more wood. Rather than being fun in a zen kind of way, it feels like tedious extra work.Further, while Castle Renovator doesnt have too many of the same tiny little items that made Motorcycle Mechanic Simulator 2021 a disaster, it still has the same affection for difficult-to-navigate menus. This means you spend lots of time making sure youre holding down just the right buttons to get to where youre trying to go, and lots of time searching around menus for specific items, and, eventually, lots of time manoeuvring around until you find just the right spot for placing items. And even if you do all this, whats your reward? Not nearly enough castles. Rather, youll spend a lot of time building and repairing small huts, as you build your way up (pun not intended) to being allowed to play with castles. Given that castles are right there in the games name, it feels like a bit of a bait-and-switch.But even if Castle Renovator delivered on exactly what its name promised, I have a hard time imagining itd be much more fun. Theres a way to make these job sims fun, and a way to make them feel like a dull slog, and every design decision here ensures that this game falls squarely in the latter camp.", "date": "March 29, 2023", "grade": "D"}
