{"name": "Penny-Punching Princess", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/05/penny-punching-princess-review-for-ps-vita-switch/", "text": "If nothing else, you have to applaud Penny-Punching Princess for taking a novel approach to all the loot you find lying around in dungeon-crawlers. Where in most games you use that money to buy upgrades, here you can use it for much more mercenary reasons: you can buy off your enemies with it.As neat an idea as that is, however, there are some problems with its execution. The game has unreasonable expectations of players dexterity, as you have to navigate the titular princess around small, confined spaces, avoiding attacks with one thumbstick while at the same time typing your dollar amounts in an onscreen calculator and then tapping the target of your bribes. Note: youll only be able to pull that off if you can balance your Vita or Switch somewhere stable, because otherwise, its probably not doable. You also have to forgo fighting back while youre doing all that, which means that you can only attempt to bribe enemies if you have a healthy amount of XP available for you to waste.There are similar issues with gathering loot. Yes, there are chests scattered throughout every dungeon. But if you really want to hit the jackpot, you need to tap on enemies after youve broken through their defenses and left them dazed. Again, neat idea, but in execution it means stopping your attacks against all the other non-dazed enemies so you can tap the screen repeatedly. Given that your grade for each battle is, in part, determined by how many coins you can pick up, its not exactly something you can just choose not to do, either.The one bit of good news about Penny-Punching Princess dungeon-crawling is that the levels are short. Theres a lot of them, so theyll still feel like a bit of a grind eventually, but at the very least, they dont try to wear you down through lengthy, monotonous, repetitive battles.Setting aside dungeon-crawling  which you probably shouldnt do, since its about 90% of the game  there are some things to like about Penny-Punching Princess. You can tell the game was formed out of the same sensibilities that gave rise to other NIS titles like Disgaea, since it has the same kind of half-serious/half-funny approach to dialogue and characters. Whether thats a good thing really depends on what you think of how well Disgaea games do it.Unfortunately, even if you think thats a point in the games favour, all the funny interactions and oddball characters in the world cant hide the fact that Penny-Punching Princess action is kind of meh. The game gets points for trying something new, but it wouldve gotten even more if that new thing had actually turned out well.", "date": "May 15, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
