{"name": "Angry Alligator", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/12/angry-alligator-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "I wasnt a huge fan of Maneater (though I know my colleague Stan would disagree). It was built around a fun idea  I mean, who wouldnt want to be a shark that eats everything?  but it felt like a one-note joke dragged out a little too long.That said, Maneater is GOTY material when you put it up against a game like Angry Alligator.I mean, this comparison is kind of unfair, since Maneater was developed by a bigger, more established team. But given that Angry Alligator mines a similar vein  the only real difference being that you play, obviously, as an alligator rather than a shark  its hard not to compare the two games. And by any standard, its just not as good.The most obvious issue is the controls. Theyre complete and utter garbage. Not only is it a massive pain to move your alligator in a straight line, you also have to contend with a camera thats incapable of finding a good angle. To that latter point, no matter how much you keep moving the camera, youll very quickly find it stuck behind a tree, or under a hill, or even inside the alligator itself, and youll never have a good view of whats happening in the world around you.And if you could, youd see all kinds of weirdness. None of the animals youre hunting move in anything resembling a normal fashion. You have beavers (I think?) that move by bouncing up and down. There are ducks that run around in circles rather than flying away (which isnt the worst evasive strategy, seeing as how hard it is to move your gator in a circle). Once I chased a frog that split apart into five different frogs.Its a deeply strange world, is what Im getting at.It doesnt help that Angry Alligators actual gameplay is incredibly tedious. The game does give you missions/fetch quests to keep things moving along, except you quickly discover that the whole point of the game is to keep eating. Your health bar is constantly winding down, so if you dont eat constantly, you quickly die and get pushed back to one of the games infrequent checkpoints.On the one hand, this is a pain, since it means that you have to contend with those awful controls. On the other hand, however, even eating everything in sight quickly gets dull, once you realize that your alligator can eat pretty much everything right off the bat. Sure, it gives some animals different power levels, and tells you your gator may not be strong enough to go running into a tougher area  but attack a more powerful creature, and even if they take a few bites from your health bar, those will be quickly refilled when you inevitably win. I mean, it should tell you something when Im someone who likes playing games on fairly forgiving settings, and even I found it boring.But thats the only way to describe Angry Alligator: its boring. Maneater, for all its problems, at least had some personality. Strip that away  along with anyone else remotely good about the game, and youre left withwell, youre left with Angry Alligator.", "date": "December 13, 2021", "grade": "D"}
