{"name": "Taco Master", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/03/taco-master-review-ps-vita/", "text": "I feel like theres an interesting discussion to be had about Taco Master. Not about the game itself, mind you  its not much more than a pretty basic mobile game thats been ported to the Vita and given a moderately easy Platinum trophy.No, Im talking about whether it could be construed as racist or not. On the one hand, it traffics in pretty blatant Mexican stereotypes, with the point of the game being that you play as a taqueria owner making greasy tacos and you have to keep up with all the orders. On the other, however, it was made by a Mexican development team. Whats more, on my one trip to Mexico a few months ago, I noticed more taco stands in one week there than I had in my entire life to that point, soI mean, considering the sheer size of Mexico City, you have to figure that, as stereotypes go, Mexican taco stand owner may have more basis in reality than any number of other, more virulent cliches. But then theres the whole notion of internalized racism to consider, and what it says about a Mexican developer that they choose to express themselves using such a well-worn trope.Or, you know, Im just reading way, way too much into a mediocre mobile game.Basically, if youve ever played Cooking Mama or Order Up!  or, really, any other game that asks you to do the same, repetitive tasks in increasingly short time frames  youve played Taco Master. You get orders for tacos, you fill them.
