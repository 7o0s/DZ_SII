Unfortunately, its a pretty by-the-numbers point-and-click adventure, so youre going to be spending at least as much time here picking up random items lying around as you will be uncovering the relatively interesting mystery that lies at the heart of this game.Its too bad, because Trberbrook feels like it should be a really easy game to love. Not only does it look incredible, it was designed using a neat mix of computer and stop-motion animation. Like, its hard to watch this games design process at work and not come away both deeply impressed and readily inclined to like anything that results from it.And all that care and attention shows up on the screen. You could pick pretty much any scene at random in Trberbrook, and youd be looking at a work of art. Its clear that a lot of energy and thought went into creating this games world, and the end result is something that feels very lived-in and homey.This carries over to the story. Theres an intriguing sci-fi mystery at the heart of Trberbrook that, as I said, involves alternate universes and Cold War Germany. As the history of the eponymous town reveals itself, it becomes very clear that the makers of this game put just as much thought into the towns past as they did into its creation. Again, you want to love Trberbrook because its so very clear that its creators did.The problem is, all those loving details are buried beneath gameplay thats generic at the best of times, painstakingly dull at worst. I know that its difficult for point-and-click adventures to stand out, but  perhaps because the rest of it is so exceptional  it still feels like a huge disappointment every time you get sidetracked from the story because its time to solve another long, convoluted puzzle, that requires your character to slowly walk over here, find item X, then slowly walk somewhere else, and find Y, and then walk to a third location, where the items combine to form Z, which gets you another couple of steps ahead. Repeat that for around six hours, and you can see why no amount of attention to detail or incredible effort can make up for lacklustre gameplay.But it feels almost insulting to say that. There arent many games that look as cared for as Trberbrook, and it would be so nice if you could embrace the game in a way that feels like it justifies the incredible amount of hours that must have gone into it. The unfortunate fact, however, is that this game may have been better served if even a little of the innovation that went into making it had shown up on the gameplay side.", "date": "December 6, 2019", "grade": "C-"}
