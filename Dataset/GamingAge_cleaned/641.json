And while Im not quite qualified to say whether its developer, TACS, were the right hands, I can say with some certainty that the PS Vita definitely isnt the right platform for this particular game. Then again, my criticisms of the game mostly extend to its PS4 version, too, so whatever issues Factotum 90 has, they go beyond the Vitas hardware limitations.Of course, some of them are entirely Vita-specific. Take, for example, the games looks. While its far from a thing of beauty on PS4, I wouldnt say that graphics are an issue. On the Vita, by contrast, everything looks muddy, and the cameras focusing on your two on-screen robots look kind of grainy. On the console version, thats a quirky design choice; on the handheld, its just ugly.Other problems cut across platforms. Those aforementioned cameras, for example, move at a snails pace, and dont show nearly enough of the levels to be useful. This means that figuring out a level requires walking around, scoping everything out, and then  often after restarting, because youll have walked yourself into a corner  very slowly executing your plan.I say very slowly because that highlights Factotum 90s other notable issue. Your robots move like theyre stuck in molasses. Considering you alternate between controlling two of them, and you have to navigate both to the end of a level in order to move on, you can see how it may get a little frustrating as you watch one crawl across a very long roomand then you watch the other one, too, because thats how this game plays.Whats frustrating about it is that its not hard to imagine Factotum 90 being a fun game. Make the robots move a little more quickly, make the camera less sticky, and suddenly nearly all the issues are fixed. In the absence of those fixes, however, youre just left with a puzzle game thats got some great ideas, but that falls just short of executing them.Of course, the fact that I my problems with the game extend to its PS4 version as well leads me to believe that its not a", "date": "December 27, 2017", "grade": "B-"}
