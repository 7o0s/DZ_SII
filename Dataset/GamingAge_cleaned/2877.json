{"name": "Lonely Mountains: Downhill", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/09/lonely-mountains-downhill-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "I feel like cycling isnt a sport that translates to video games particularly well, generally speaking. I remember playing  and being bored to death by  a Tour de France game at some point in the last several years, and even the Wii Sports Resort version wasnt particularly interesting. I mean, I love cycling in real life to a moderately unhealthy degree (Im one of those people who even bikes when its thirty below), and even Im fully capable of acknowledging that its super repetitive by its very nature  its not easy to make the act of pedaling very exciting.So, from that perspective, Lonely Mountains: Downhill is kind of impressive, in that its a game about cycling thats not terrible. Its got some flaws, which Ill get to shortly, but on the whole, I didnt hate it.This, I suspect, can be attributed to that fact that its less about the act of cycling, and more about capturing the feeling of it. The game takes place across a series of mountain trails, and you just bike downhill. You bike through fields and forests, across rocks and over streams, and you hear the wind and insects and babbling brooks. At its best, its a pretty relaxing game.Unfortunately, the game isnt always at its best. Lonely Mountains: Downhill has got an absolutely brutal camera that doesnt always show you exactly where youre going  which is kind of a big deal, seeing as the game often leaves you with no margin for error. Not only do you face all the obvious dangers of biking down a steep mountain  that is, falling off the edge of a cliff and tumbling to your death  your bike is also prone to hitting tree roots and edges of rocks that stop you dead in your tracks. While my annual tire innertube budget would acknowledge theres some truth to that, it ultimately feels a little too unforgiving.", "date": "September 15, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
