Rather, its meant to assuage the fears of anyone who took note of Fort Defenses European release issues, and was concerned that the game may have reached North America in a similarly unplayable state. Happily, if youre buying the game here, you dont have anything to worry about  it installs and plays without any problems.Of course, if your standards for games are a little more demanding that simply asking, Does it work?, then you might find Fort Defense to be a little wanting. Which isnt to say the game is a terrible trainwreck or anything; Ive certainly played far, far worse games than this.Ive also played far, far better, though, and thats where the problem lies. Fort Defense is neither very good nor very bad; its just there. Its a run-of-the-mill tower defense game that doesnt alter the formula in any significant way. Let me put it this way: the most significant change to the formula that Fort Defense makes is that it gives you the option of using a couple of non-stationary weapons, like diseases and reefs.Are you trembling with excitement yet? Me neither. Round that out with slightly terrible graphics and maps that all look very, very similar, and you can see why its hard to get too enthused about Fort Defense.", "date": "February 24, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
