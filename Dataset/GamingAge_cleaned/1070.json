{"name": "MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/07/megatagmension-blanc-neptune-vs-zombies-review-ps-vita/", "text": "As Ive written before, theres a pretty straightforward way to figure out whether a Hyperdimension Neptunia game will be worth your time. If its a mainline game, itll probably be a generically okay. If its a spin-off from the main series, theres a good chance itll be worth your time. About a half-dozen games into the franchises Vita lifespan, and that maxim hasnt failed me yet.MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies is a Hyperdimension spin-off, soneed I say more?Actually, I do, because MegaTagmension represents the first Hyperdimension spin-off that hasnt blown me away. To some extent, this is because my expectations were so high. All I knew going into it was that it was a hack & slash game, and that the enemies were, as the title implied, zombies. If that wasnt a recipe for success, I didnt know what was.Unfortunately, my calculations of hack & slash + zombies = awesome!!! left out one crucial fact: this series well-documented love of lengthy dialogue sequences. While you do get to slash your way through zombies, its only in limited quantities. In general, you have to sit through get several minutes of dialogue just to get a minute or two of action, which means that while you do get to slash some zombies, it wont be as much as youd probably like. In fact, you have a specific number to kill, and once you reach that number, the level ends, even if there are still undead teddy bears/otakus/blobs jumping around.Surprisingly, though, what redeems MegaTagmension is the very thing that I was literally just complaining about  those aforementioned lengthy dialogue sequences. In contrast to most other games in the series, the dialogue here isnt filled with innuendo and referential in-jokes about Japanese gaming. I mean, those things are certainly present, dont get me wrong. But theres a balance here  more frequently, the girls here are just as likely to turn their knowing senses of humour to the absurdity of the plot, or to discuss zombie movie tropes. Its not that big a departure from the usual content, but its just different enough that you feel like youre included in what theyre talking about, even if you dont have an encyclopedic knowledge of Japans gaming culture.", "date": "July 22, 2016", "grade": "B+"}
