Its got very nice-looking visuals, a pleasant-sounding score, and an engaging story. If it existed in a vacuum, Id be raving about it.But (You knew there was a but coming, right?)It doesnt exist in a vacuum. It exists in a world where we already have Florence  and Florence came out a few years earlier than When The Past Was Around, making the latter seem like a pale imitation.Obviously, theres room in the world for both games. I mean, you could very easily finish both of them in well under two hours, so its not as if theyre both putting insane demands on your time. And, whats more, its not like I want to see less heartfelt indie games put out into the world.Its just that, again, the games are so identical, its impossible not to compare them  and on every front, When The Past Was Around doesnt quite measure up. When The Past Was Around looks nice and dreamy  but not as gorgeous as Florence does. When The Past Was Around does a nice job of telling a story without using any words  but its in no way as affecting as Florences story. The music in When The Past Was Around is very nice  but in Florence, its transcendent. When The Past Was Around finds a way to include some interesting puzzles in the mix  but Florence found a way to be interactive without letting its little challenges get in the way of its story. Its like that at every turn, in every respect. When The Past Was Around is good  but its no Florence.Though, again, its not like were talking about some crazily oversaturated genre. By my count, When The Past Was Around brings the total of wordless games about young women growing up and making their way through love and less, set to lovely music to approximately two. Obviously, you should play that other one first. But once youre finished that, then you should still find the time to investigate When The Past Was Around, too.", "date": "August 19, 2021", "grade": "B+"}
