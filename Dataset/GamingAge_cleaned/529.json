How else could I start a Rick and Morty video game review? In just three short seasons, Rick and Morty has become one of the biggest shows on TV. Fans will be waiting some time for new episodes (hopefully not too long as announced recently; a new deal of 70 episodes was confirmed) but fortunately for us, is here to help alleviate the waiting. Outside of mobile games, this is the first video game to feature a Plumbus I mean Rick and Morty. Justin Roiland (the shows creator) is a big gamer as you can tell from the show and his social media accounts, so he decided to go all in with the VR craze (fad), even starting his own studio. While its incredible to feel like youre in this cartoon world, especially as a huge fan, there still are some drawbacks.Let me give you some background on where I stand with PSVR. I have only owned my PSVR since December of 2017, when the prices dropped. I dont see the VR trend as anything more than that, its an antisocial experience and it cant be played for extended periods of time. Having said those negatives, I have really enjoyed my time with the PSVR in the past 5 months. Is it the future of gaming? No, its not, and I think thats been all but decided by the lack of releases and new titles in development. However, is it an awesome way to immerse yourself into some of your favorite worlds or stories? Absolutely! Lets just say this up front Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality is my favorite PSVR title thus far (well, tie with Arkham VR).The impact of Justin Roiland and the team of fans that were part of the development is immediately evident upon starting up the game. Unfortunately, like many VR titles, the game isnt very long; its actually very short and can be completed in a little over an hour. Worry not Mr. Poopybutthole, there are plenty of hidden easter eggs to find and areas to squanch. With such a short story, its not something which I really want to spoil any aspects. I will say that you play the role of a Morty clone doing grandpa Ricks tasks and along the way youll release Meeseeks (which are called Youseeks), go through portals, and even help Jerry with some hemorrhoids. Fans of the show will not be disappointed and if they havent already laid out some schmeckles and picked up the game (the game has been on the Oculus and Vive for a year), its probably a safe bet to grab it now.", "date": "May 16, 2018", "grade": "B+"}
