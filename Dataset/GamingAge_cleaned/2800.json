I mean, thats obviously true for most games, but it seems especially appropriate in this case.If you play Monster Prom: XXL as a party game with a couple of friends, its probably a blast. Its kind of like what I imagine a dating sim filtered through Cards Against Humanity might look, with every single interaction you have trying to both shock you and make you laugh with an overabundance of sex, swearing, violence and drugs. Obviously, thats not for everyone, but if you  and more importantly, the group of friends with whom youre playing the game  are a fan of the outrageous, this should do the trick.Unfortunately, as you can probably tell by the way that last paragraph was phrased, I didnt play Monster Prom: XXL with anyone. I played it solo, where the games charms get old much, much faster. Its still kind of funny the first couple of times you play it, but by your third or fourth playthrough you quickly realize that even if the endings change depending on which monster you play as and which monster youre trying to woo, the path doesnt vary all that much. Theres always a rave in the field, and a dodgeball game in the gym, and studying in the classroom, and debates at the cafeteria tables. Given that you cant skip through most of the game beyond the first couple of scenes, that inevitably means seeing the same scenes over, and over, and over again. None of it gets funnier the more you see it.Mind you, its worth noting that Monster Prom: XXL includes both a base game and the Second Term DLC, and the DLC pack is much more enjoyable than the base game. Its more or less the same game  youre still playing as one of four monsters, and youre still playing through three weeks of classes and extracurricular activities as you try and woo one special monster to be your prom date  but with a few key differences. There are more monsters to woo, for starters, and the game seems a little more predictable in how choices will play out.That latter change makes a massive difference. The core Monster Prom game seems to be built on randomness. One time I had a monster telling my character how much it loved me in one scene, only for them to completely reject my prom invite in literally the very next turn. By contrast, in the DLC, it felt like the game makes more of an effort to tell you which monsters are into you, which makes the game flow much more smoothly and logically.Not that this game is all that logical. Were not talking about your standard dating sim, but rather one where you have to settle debates monsters whove locked a fairy in a cage and need to know what to do (I picked kidnap another fairy to give the first one a friend), or who need suggestions on where to get more pudding (rob the pudding factory, duh), or who want to tell a robot how to woo a vending machine (be forward, obviously). The difference between the base game and the DLC is that none of what you do seems to matter in the former, but in the DLC other monsters seem to remember your decisions, which makes a world of difference.That said, I wouldnt say its enough to make Monster Prom: XXL worthwhile if youre going to play solo  its still a party game through and through. But if youve got a group of not-easily-offended friends together and youre looking for something a little different, itll definitely do the trick.", "date": "December 3, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
