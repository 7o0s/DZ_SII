{"name": "Dokuro", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/12/dokuro-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Heres the thing you need to know about Dokuro: if youre going to play (and if you own a Vita, you absolutely should), you need to be okay with dying. Like, a lot. In all manners of fashion. Youre going to be crushed by falling crates. Youre going to fall down holes. Youre going to be killed by vengeful demons. Youre going to be roasted by fire. Youre going to get hit by swinging, rotating blades. Youre going to get skewered by giant spikes. Basically, youre going to die again, and again, and again, and again.Okay, maybe you can take off one of those agains. You might not die as much as me  after all, I tend to approach every game like its God of War (or any other similarly over-the-top action game), which means I tend to just run into any situation without thinking things through first. And Dokuro, being a puzzle-platformer (with an emphasis on the puzzles), is most definitely a game that rewards careful planning and execution.Heres the thing, though: this is one of those games where you wont mind dying frequently. While its extremely tough, it never comes off as impossible. In general, the difficulty in solving puzzles comes not from figuring out the solution, but from pulling it off. Its one thing, for example, to realize you need to push a crate off one side of a seesawing board and down into a hole, where you can push the princess standing atop the crate from one side of the hole to the other. Its another to:Oh, as youre doing those last few steps, you have to avoid the flames that have started shooting down from the bridge over the hole.It sounds like a lot  just as it would sound like a lot to describe the solutions to any of the other puzzles in the game  but its also pretty clear what you have to do almost instantly. Consequently, even as you die for the dozenth time, its not hard to shake off the failure and try again. The game may be punishingly hard, but it never feels impossible.In part, some of this is because the controls are outstanding. Considering how precise most of your movements need to be, it would be a massive failure if the game didnt have tight controls. It does, and Game Arts deserves praise for everything working so perfectly.Also deserving of praise: the games style. Much like Rayman Origins last year, Dokuro is an excellent reminder that games dont have to be 3D to be gorgeous. In fact, on this front you could argue that Dokuros achievement is even more impressive, seeing as most of the game is black and white, with a few splashes of colour here and there. The game looks like a moving charcoal or chalk drawing, and, quite simply, the effect is stunning.", "date": "December 5, 2012", "grade": "A-"}
