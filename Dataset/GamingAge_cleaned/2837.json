Its a bunch of animals (literally, as in a frog and some dogs and a fox) flying around in steampunk airships, fighting with pirates on behalf of the queen. I lost track of the plot very early on, and I dont feel like I missed all that much.Likewise, its not like its got revolutionary gameplay. Steam Tactics is, as its name implies, a pretty straightforward tactical RPG. Your ships fight groups of enemy ships on a grid. It gradually gets more difficult the further into the game you get, so you need to continually keep upgrading your ships. If youve ever played a tactical RPG, youll know exactly what youre in for here  and even if you somehow havent, this game is more than simple enough to pick up pretty quickly.I suspect its that last line that captures why Im so addicted to the game. Where a lot of tactical games will try and bog you down in complexity, Steam Tactics keeps everything as easy as possible. Even when I needed to start going back to grind through earlier levels at more challenging difficulty settings in order to improve my airships, it never felt like a huge hassle, since I knew what needed to be done, even if it frequently took me a couple of tries to get through the levels as they got harder.To be sure, I wouldnt say that Steam Tactics is a GOTY contender or anything. Its far too simplistic for that. But when that simplicity is enough to keep me going back to the game again and again, even when theres plenty of other stuff I probably should be playing instead, thats more than enough to make the game worthy of a recommendation.", "date": "October 29, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
