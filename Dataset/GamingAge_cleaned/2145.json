Butwell, here we are.If you can set aside any existential dread about the end of life as we know it and just focus on the game, you quickly discover that Boris the Rocket is a time- and resource-management sim set in Soviet Russia. Given the authoritarian setting, you might be tempted to think of Papers, Please or Beholder, but neither of those quite work as comparisons. For one thing, theyre both much better games, which knew how to juggle their monotonous tasks with life-or-death stakes that conveyed the paranoia of living in a dictatorship. Crazy demands piled on top of crazy demands, but they always made it feel like there were consequences to failure. In Boris the Rocket, by contrast, the whole threat of nuclear annihilation is played for a laugh. Again, when the game was being developed they couldnt have foreseen how scary reality would become, but it definitely makes it harder to take the game seriously. For another, Boris the Rocket has much more in common with a game like Please Dont Touch Anything. It, too, expected you to remember an absurd number of tasks, and it was built around logic that didnt always make a tonne of sense. In Boris the Rocket, the game just keeps on piling more and more, and always expects you to keep up  and failing to do so means game over.But even the comparison to Please Dont Touch Anything doesnt quite work, since Boris the Rocket puts a timer on your actions, so not only do you have to remember how to string together a bunch of random tasks, youre doing so as a clock ticks down. It definitely adds an element of franticness to the proceedings, but it doesnt make it any more fun. It just feels like do this, now do this, now do this, repeated over and over. Again, a big part of Boris the Rockets problem is completely unintentional and far, far beyond its control. But even if you could somehow ignore real world news, youd still be left with a game thats basically Simon, but with nukes.", "date": "March 24, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
