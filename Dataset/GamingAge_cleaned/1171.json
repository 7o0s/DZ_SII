Ive been one for pretty much my entire life. My first job ever was in a political office. I got my degree in political science. As my mom is fond of reminding me, I was once sent to the principals office for being too disruptive in class, after I started telling off my classmates for not being politically aware; I was 7 at the time.In other words, The Political Machine 2016 seems like it should be right up my alley. I may be Canadian, but that doesnt mean I dont find U.S. politics  and, especially, elections  endlessly fascinating. And thanks to a combination of the Fourteenth Amendment and Citizens United, this is probably the closest Im ever going to come to actually having anything to do with a U.S. election, so I should be all over it, right?Rightto an extent. I enjoy The Political Machine 2016 for what it is. The opportunity to guide someone like Elizabeth Warren or Al Franken to the White House is pretty awesome, to say nothing of the create-a-character option. Whats more, its neat to go on news programs and answer questions that are almost literally ripped from the headlines, and to travel from state to state giving speeches and running ads and doing fundraisers, and to pick a running mate, and to do a lot of those other things that make campaigns seem like so much fun. In that respect, this game is amazing.That said, I cant help but wish there was even more to it. Like, its fun creating an in-game avatar and seeing how well I fare in a run at the White House, but any similarities between me and the character I created were almost entirely accidental. Rather than giving you free reign to thoughtfully weigh your options and come up with a platform that reflects your belief system, The Political Machine 2016 allocates you a fixed number of points, and forces you to divide them up amongst a wide array of topics. Basically, that means you can be firmly pro-choice, or a supporter of Black Lives Matter, or a staunch environmentalist (or, alternatively, you can be a gun nut or a homophobe or a climate change denier), but not all three at once. At best, you can make it so that your character leans mildly to one side or another on a range of contentious issues, but the moment you want to become more firmly in favour of one thing or another, you basically shut out the ability to feel that strongly about anything else. Considering were in a period of seemingly ever-increasing polarization, such forced moderation  while something that would be welcome in real life  comes off as a little strained.", "date": "March 16, 2016", "grade": "B+"}
