{"name": "Sparkle Unleashed", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/06/sparkle-unleashed-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Seeing as Sparkle Unleashed is basically Sparkle 2 with a slightly different control scheme, and that Sparkle 2 was basically just Sparkle with a different name, and that Sparkle was really just a reskinned Zuma, I dont have much to say about the newest game in the franchise that I didnt write back in December 2013.I mean, just consider the games big new  and possibly only new  feature: the marble shooter moves along the bottom, instead of remaining in a static position. As changes go, thats basically on par with a new hat in terms of innovation. It changes Sparkles basic gameplay so little, wed have to have a semantic discussion about what exactly change is in order to properly measure it here.Beyond that one thing, Sparkle Unleashed is identical to the first two games in the series. It looks the same in virtually every respect, from the environments to the overworld maps to the balls themselves. The gameplay hasnt changed all that much either; apart from the aforementioned moving marble shooter, there are a couple of power-ups and obstacles here that werent present the first two times around, but again, the amount of tangible difference they make to the way you play the game is so small that its very existence is debatable.", "date": "June 26, 2015", "grade": "C+"}
