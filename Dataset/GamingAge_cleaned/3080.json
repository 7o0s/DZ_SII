{"name": "Pic-a-Pix Classic 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/02/pic-a-pix-classic-2-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Given that just a few weeks ago I was raving about Pic-a-Pix Color 2, you might think Id be equally over the moon about Pic-a-Pix Classic 2. I mean, its the same developer, the same genre, and its a sequel to another game I loved  that seems like a pretty safe recipe for success.And yet, despite all that, I actually feel kind of tepid towards Pic-a-Pix Classic 2. Its fine for what it is  that is, a monochromatic nonogram game  but what it is really isnt all that exciting.I know its kind of irrational to praise one nonogram game a few weeks ago and then damn Pic-a-Pix Classic 2 with faint praise, but playing the two games so close together really makes it clear how much a splash of colour adds to the formula. Its neat to not only see pictures take shape as you fill them in, piece by piece, but to also see how the pictures get more complex as you get more colours to work with. Here, by contrast (pardon the expression), it all feels a little too simplistic to be really satisfying.", "date": "February 5, 2020", "grade": "B"}
