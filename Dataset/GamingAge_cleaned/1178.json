{"name": "Gravity Rush Remastered", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/03/gravity-rush-remastered-review-ps4/", "text": "What works on a handheld isnt always what works on a console. I dont think this is a particularly controversial assertion to make. After all, whats graphically impressive on the Vita or the Nintendo 3DS (or the PSP, or the DS, and so on) isnt nearly as much so on a home console. Likewise, you generally want different gameplay on the go than you do sitting in your couch. Just think back to the first handheld hit, Tetris: its hard to imagine it wouldve been as much a cultural phenomenon, at least here in the West, had it not arrived on the Gameboy.Unfortunately, this point is entirely reinforced by Gravity Rush, re-branded as Gravity Rush Remastered now that its made the jump from Vita to PS4. What looked insanely good on the Vitas small screen is a little less visually impressive when you compare it to whats out there on Sonys home console. By no means, of course, is it an ugly game, but the its whole anime-meets-comic book aesthetic doesnt look as exceptional when you blow it up to many times its original size.Likewise, the same could be said for Gravity Rushs world: it felt enormous on the Vita, in no small part because it was  and still is  one of the most ambitious games available on the handheld. Again, theres still a decent-sized world here to explore, but compared to the likes of any of the PS4s open world games, Hekseville feels a little cramped, claustrophobic and repetitive.And speaking of cramped: the missions and objectives themselves. They feel more limited in nature here, more like  surprise, surprise  they were meant to be completed during a commute, or in bite-sized bursts. Thats not to say you cant string together a bunch of missions, but you may get annoyed by the way it seems to stop and start with so much regularity.All that said, Gravity Rush Remastered isnt a total loss. Traversing the world feels a little bit easier here than it did on the Vita; with more screen real estate, you can get a better sense of where youre going and where you want to go. Not only that, whereas the original made use of the Vitas gyroscope, here theyve ditched that in favor of just letting you use the thumbsticks. For someone whos never felt entirely comfortable with tilt controls, no matter how much I use them, that kind of change feels like a welcome upgrade.", "date": "March 8, 2016", "grade": "B"}
