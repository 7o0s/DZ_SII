Earlier this year they released Fatum Betula, which was an utterly bizarre piece of PS1-tinged weirdness. Now theyre back with Paratopic, and, while its a little more straightforward than Fatum Betula, its still stranger than most games youll come across.What Paratopic has going for it in terms of being more comprehensible is that theres a vague outline of a plot. I wouldnt be able to tell you beat-by-beat how the story unfolds, but I can tell you it involves video tapes, and black, human-shaped monsters, and peoples heads exploding. Its all told via lengthy scenes that cut away at random moments, making it hard to ever fully get your bearings  which, I think, is kind of the point.While I cant say that the story pulled me in, Ill still give Paratopic credit for its creepy aesthetic. On top of its blocky, PS1-style graphics, it also has a deeply unsettling score that does its best to keep you constantly on edge. Combine those two things together  the score and the visuals  and you have the beginnings of a very good horror game.But unless you really enjoy half-finished stories, Paratopic never really builds on its great aesthetic to be a game worth playing. It may aspire to bring you back to the late 90s, but given how disjointed it all feels, it never achieves its goal.", "date": "July 18, 2022", "grade": "C"}
