{"name": "Adata S511 SSD Hardware Review", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/03/adata-s511-ssd/", "text": "In January I was lucky enough to get my greasy mitts on one of Adatas newer SSD offerings, the 120gig S511. S511 series uses the new SandForce SF-2281 controller, meaning it doesnt suffer from poorer incompressible data performance as much as previous controllers did. Essentially what this means is that the speed of transfer is more consistent regardless of what type of data is being accessed (compressed or uncompressed.) This is a good thing, as a lot of games and graphic data is compressed, only decompressing as its gets rendered, spewing out of memory and on to the screen (yes, I know thats dumbed way down.)Technical mumbo-jumbo aside, it really is extraordinary how much an SSD can affect your entire systems performance. After all, its like having RAM as your storage, removing one of the biggest bottlenecks in a lot of current computers. Since I got the drive Ive become somewhat smitten with SSDs; theyre just that fast. When connected to an SATA 3.0 (6Gbps) port the S511 was rocking a solid ~530/500megs/s read/write in AJA System Test. While AJA is a synthetic bench and not very real-world, its still five times faster than what my 7200rpm drive scored.Now even though Windows 7 loads in under 26 seconds from POST to Steam Log-in (compared to about a minute with a 7200rpm drive) and the systems overall snappiness is noticeably better, I was still very curious to find out how super-fast storage affects gaming performance. So to find out I loaded up a couple of games (and a benchmark) before and after switching drives. Same system and same drivers/software were used, so any differences were caused entirely by the SSD. Anyway, here are the results:Test System:i7 920 @ 4.2GHz (200 x 21)24gigs of DDR3-1600 (9-9-9-24-1T)HDD: WD 500Gig 7200rpm SATA2  SSD: Adata 120gig S511So while fast access seems to give better fps, the slight differences alone probably arent enough to warrant a purchase for most people.Despite the lackluster boost in fps, there are other (anecdotal) advantages that Ive noticed when gaming on an SSD. A few games saw tangible image quality benefits with the faster read speeds, specifically games that stream a lot of game data aggressively. Console ports typically fall into this category and I found the best example to be the PC version of id softwares RAGE, as the games megatexture technology has been known to suffer minor streaming hurdles (drivers and game updates have minimized the problem, but its still present). Since installing it on an SSD its been a non-issue; whatever it needs to load, it does so faster then is perceptible.The other obvious advantage, and this is for every game (and every application for that matter), is a decrease in load times. On titles such as Crysis and Witcher, which have been known to take their time, the differences were substantial (10seconds ). Similarly, there is far less hitching/stuttering in games that have a tendency to do so. This phenomenon is far more evident  and exponentially more annoying  when the game otherwise runs at 60fps. For my system, the only culprit prior to the casino online  storage upgrade was Battlefield 3, which used to pause a few times a minute despite clean installs, formatting, or defragging the drive (and no, it wasnt lag). Once installed on the S511 however, the hitching I experienced in BF3 magically disappeared. While these may seem like negligible improvements by themselves, when combined they make your overall PC gaming experience so much more fluid.All of that said, there is one major problem with SSDs and its a simple one: cost. SSDs currently cost about ~$1.50 per gigabyte (varies greatly depending on the manufacturer and size of drive). Comparatively, regular platter drives cost ~$0.07 per gigabyte (3TB for ~$200) and prices still havent completely settled since last years flooding in Thailand (it should be closer to 5 or 6 cents a gig). The silver lining is that, compared to even 2010, prices of SSDs have been cut by a third in spite of the huge performance improvements theyve seen since then In other words, their prices are coming down even as their speeds go up. With any luck, 2012 will see the drives become even more affordable.", "date": "March 3, 2012", "grade": null}
