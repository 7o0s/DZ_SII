{"name": "Brawl", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/05/brawl-review-for-ps4/", "text": "Brawl isnt the worst game Ive ever played.That, believe it or not, isnt damning the game with faint praise, nor is it the ultimate backhanded compliment. Rather, its the kind of thing that needs to be said when the last game its developers published on PS4, the abominable Basement Crawl, has a legitimate argument for being the worst game ever. It was awful in every way imaginable, to the point Bloober Team issued an open letter apologizing for its many, many issues just days after its initial release. That they dont challenge for the title of worst game ever this time around represents a huge step forward.(Of course, if I were the nitpicking sort, I might take issue with the fact Bloober promised Basement Crawl owners a substantial, issue-fixing update, and instead just released a new game. Not that I dont see the logic in trying to put something so horrible as far behind you as possible, but if Id paid for Basement Crawl, Id feel a little put out at the moment.)Im not saying Brawl is great, by any stretch of the imagination. Its online is completely dead, which means that I cant say whether its improved from its abysmal performance last time around. It also means if you want a good online Bomberman clone, youre not going to get it here.Here, however, is where Brawl departs from Basement Crawl. See, this time around Bloober thought to include a single-player mode, which means the lack of an online community doesnt render the game completely useless. Likewise, they kick off the game with a tutorial for each character, which means youre not wandering around blindly pressing buttons and hoping one of them works in that moment. Simply by including those two features, the game is able to make the leap from Oh God, kill it with fire to Competent.Is it a good single-player mode? Not particularly. Youll quickly discover that youre essentially tasked with the same thing every time, which means that if running around a square board placing bombs does nothing for you, youre not going to find yourself sucked into Brawls morbid little world. But, again, it works without crashing, glitching, or dropping you into unwinnable situations, which means it represents a massive step forward from its predecessor.Happily, this step forward into mediocrity has been accompanied by a retainment of the creepy atmosphere that permeated Basement Crawl. In fact, its even more apparent here, since Brawl features more characters and a story mode, meaning the grotesqueness that was only hinted at the first time around gets a chance to be fully fleshed out. I cant say I find it particularly pleasant  but at the same time, I dont think Im supposed to find myself drawn to any of these characters. Theyre designed to be repulsive, and they are, soI guess that means theyve done their job?", "date": "May 27, 2015", "grade": "B-"}
