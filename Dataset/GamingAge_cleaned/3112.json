They may not aspire to be much more than pleasant games, but theres something about the lack of pressure and direction (and accompanying cuteness) that speaks to me.Unfortunately, Time on Frog Island shows that just because a game fits into that general micro-genre, it doesnt necessarily mean Im going to enjoy it.I mean, I want to like Time on Frog Island. Its got a cute premise: youve been shipwrecked on an island full of humanoid frogs, and you fix your ship by solving problems for them. Add in some equally cute graphics and communication thats done entirely in pictograms, and you can see why its in the same neighbourhood as some of those other games I enjoy.But the execution is all off. You can kind of see why in the above paragraph, in the part about everyone using pictograms to communicate. While that may look fun, its not exactly the most informative way of speaking. Just because a frog tells you it wantsI dont know, something that looks like a happy piece of sushi (?), it may take you awhile before youre able to figure out that the frog wants some kind of blue bug. Not only that, in order to find those, you need to a) search the island until you find those bugs (and theyre not anywhere nearby), b) realize that you need to feed the bugs blue fruit so that they turn blue, c) puzzle out that to grow the blue fruit, you need to scare away the crows, which in turn requires d) figuring out a way to fix the islands scarecrows. I know that theres a bit of a spoiler in there for one of the first tasks in the game, but in all honesty, I had to find that info out from a walkthrough, so I figure I cant be the only one wholl be stumped by Time on Frog Island very early on. Whats more, the game doesnt make it easier on you. Theres no map, for one thing, and were not talking about an island with a bunch of unique or distinctive biomes, so its easy to lose track of both where youre going and where youve been. Even worse, theres no way to check what tasks you need to do  Time on Frog Island just assumes youll remember the pictogram and be able to go from there, without any kind of quest list for you to keep in all sorted. In fact, Id say that the lack of a quest list might just be Time on Frog Islands biggest issue. After all, were talking about a game thats basically nothing but fetch quests, so for the game to not include a way of keeping track of your one task seems like a major oversight.Then again, maybe the makers of Time on Frog Island just figured they could get by on a cute premise and general aesthetic. To be sure, in some cases that may be enough, but in this case, it just means you have a game that has the right tone but none of the right content.", "date": "December 30, 2022", "grade": "C"}
