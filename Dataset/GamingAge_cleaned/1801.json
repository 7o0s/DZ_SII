{"name": "Fatum Betula", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/05/fatum-betula-review-for-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Fatum Betula is weird.I really dont know what else there is to say about it. Its an artsy game thats heavily influenced by the strangest PS1-era games you can imagine. A giant mouth gives you beakers. You find a skeleton that wishes for death. You pick up a knife stuck into a tree. Theres a talking cat.I may or may not have just spoiled a huge chunk of the game, and I honestly have no idea whether I did. There are branching paths and multiple endings, and Im sure that somehow it all eventually makes sense  but I really have no idea how.Im probably a philistine for admitting that. Fatum Betula feels like its very much into the idea of games as art, particularly if, as I said, youre fond of the weirdest games the mid- to late-90s had to offer. That goes for the graphics, too  Fatum Betula isnt a very attractive game unless youre really into muddy polygons.And Im sure some people are  starting with its creators. Fatum Betula is a strange game geared towards a very specific niche. I cant say Im in that niche, but if you are, its probably going to be right up your alley.", "date": "May 9, 2022", "grade": "C"}
