Now that Ive played both Blacksad: Under the Skin and Chicken Police  Paint it RED!well, I still dont know if thats enough to call it a whole genre, but its at the very least a subgenre.And within that subgenre, its pretty clear that Chicken Police is the vastly superior of the two games.To some extent, this can be chalked up to the fact its not a broken, buggy mess. Blacksad required patching just to get it to a point where it didnt crash constantly, and even after that it struggled to do anything without painfully long load times and constant stuttering. Simply by virtue of the fact it runs fairly smoothly, Chicken Police has a leg up on its competition.More than that, though, Chicken Police is just a well-made game. Its somewhere between a visual novel and a point and click adventure, as you follow private detective Sonny Featherland and his partner, Marty MacChicken, in a hard-boiled noir that takes them around the city of Clawville, investigating a case and meeting the denizens of that citys seedy underbelly.To some extent, the game is kind of like LA Noire, if that game had been populated entirely by anthropomorphized animals. You interrogate suspects, you investigate crime scenes, you carefully build up your case  theres not as much action (the odd minigame notwithstanding), but the basics are all there.More importantly, the story is, too. Chicken Police was clearly written by someone who loves Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, because the plot  with its double-crossing dames and no-good hoodlums  is straight out of a hard-boiled mystery novel. Its supported by some very good voice acting, with everyone involved clearly being a fan of films like The Big Sleep and The Postman Always Rings Twice.Just about the only issue I had with Chicken Police was the initial weirdness of seeing animal heads on human bodies. Theres something incredibly disconcerting about seeing an impalas head on a womans body, or even seeing porcupines in raincoats, but its a mark of how well the game is made that its not long before you dont even notice it.Instead, you notice that this is just a very good game. Chicken Police is an off-kilter approach to a well-worn genre, but its so well done that its worth playing if youre any kind of fan of adventure games or visual novels.", "date": "April 1, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
