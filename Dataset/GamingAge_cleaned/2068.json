{"name": "Machinarium", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/04/machinarium-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Im a staunch believer that theres no wrong way to play a game. There are, however, some ways are significantly less right than others. Take, for example, how I played Machinarium: with a walkthrough for the PC version on hand at all times. Considering its a point-and-click puzzle game  a genre where half the fun is figuring things out  and, wellyou can see why Id classify my playthrough as less right.In my defense, however, its a pretty difficult game. From the second screen onwards, there are puzzles I couldnt possibly have solved without a hint or two (or ten). While many of the solutions seem kind of obvious in retrospect (and probably are pretty obvious, if youre a more spatially gifted person than I am), there are plenty of places where I couldnt have possibly moved forward unless I had something guiding me through.Which leads to the bigger reason for why I played Machinarium with a walkthrough: because I constantly wanted more of it. More of its adorable story, more of its gorgeous graphics, more of its atmospheric music. As far as Im concerned, whatever pleasure could have been had from the self-satisfaction of figuring out a tough puzzle on my own was outweighed by the simple desire to experience as much of the game as possible without delay. Theres clearly a lesson to be had here in delayed gratification, but Machinarium is just so lovely that its lost on me  indeed, it will probably be lost on anyone looking to experience the game more for its visual delights than for its puzzle-solving opportunities.I suspect, though, that the more patient types (the people who just want to solve puzzles) will get a lot more out of Machinarium. Even if Im incapable of doing it, I can certainly see the appeal of clicking everywhere on the screen and playing around with every item you come across in the hopes of discovering more of the games secrets. In fact, the Vita version is probably ideal if youre this kind of person, since it allows you to use the front and rear touchscreens in addition to the sticks and buttons.", "date": "April 15, 2013", "grade": "A"}
