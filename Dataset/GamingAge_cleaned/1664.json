{"name": "The Last Tinker: City of Colors", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/08/last-tinker-city-colors-review-ps4/", "text": "A word to the wise: if and when you play The Last Tinker: City of Colors, have a pair of sunglasses on hand. Or have your contrast or gamma or brightness or whatever turned way, waaaay down. Orwell, do whatever you can to dim the screen a little, because the games default setting is, apparently, hideous eyesore. (Note: theres also a color-blind version. This does not look substantially better, though the colors are more puke-inspired than eye-searing, soprogress?)And once you have muted The Last Tinkers colors, what then? Does that make it worth playing? In a nutshell: yep.See, this game is a throwback to Ratchet & Clank, to Jak & Daxter, to Sly Cooper: to all those excellent 3D platformers that, other than Knack and maybe Rayman, dont seem to appear much on non-Nintendo platforms anymore. Youve got your animal character with an attitude (in this case, a simian named Koru), youve got a sidekick (a pig-sheep-hybrid-thingy called Tap), youve got a couple of different worlds to explore  basically, it hews very closely to the formula established by those games, and it does that extremely well. Throw in hint of de Blob, with the heavy emphasis that color plays in The Last Tinkers storyline, and Tearaway, with the use of papercraft in some of the environments, and youve got a pretty good idea of what youre in for here.Admittedly, this seems to be a little more child-oriented than any of those games. If that wasnt obvious from the color palette  that, again, looks like technicolor rainbow vomit  then it should be from the controls. You cant jump, which iswell, kind of crazy when you think about it, since this is a platformer were talking about. As you can imagine, not needing to press the jump button makes things significantly easier than in any of those aforementioned predecessors. (In fairness, as you progress through the game, timing your forward motion matters a little more, but it still doesnt quite have the same feel.)", "date": "August 19, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
