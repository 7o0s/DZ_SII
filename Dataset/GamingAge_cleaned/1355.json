First and foremost, its entirely subjective; what one person finds hilarious someone else may find irredeemably stupid. I mean, I think Portal is one of the wittiest things ever created, but Im sure there are some people out there who think otherwise, just as Im baffled by those who titter over Senran Kaguras boob-based humor. (Such people, of course, are totally wrong on both counts, but, as I said: its subjective.) Not only that, sustaining a joke over the course of a game is hard work. Think of how many TV shows can barely string enough jokes together to last half an hour; now compare that to a game, that needs to sustain a comedic tone for several times as long. All in all, its not hard to see why a lot of games dont even bother with it.Which brings us to Hatoful Boyfriend.Personally, I think the games premise is hilarious: youre a human student at an all-bird school, and youre looking for love. On top of that, Hatoful Boyfriend is a parody of visual novels  and having played my fair share of those, I can attest to the fact its a genre thats ripe for parody. At the same time, though, I can see how the premise may not tickle everyones funny bone. This game relies on players to not just have a healthy appreciation for the absurd and a willingness to laugh at the inherent silliness of certain genres, but also a more-than-passing familiarity with visual novel conventions. While that may apply to me, lets be real here: people who really, really love visual novels may not like it being mocked.The ironic thing is, its that particular subset of people  ardent visual novel fans  who would probably enjoy Hatoful Boyfriend the most. Because once you get beyond the games inherent absurdity, it quickly becomes apparent that its really not all that different from most other visual novels. You go to school, you choose your electives to build up your stats, you interact with other teachers and students: if youve done that anywhere else, it will all feel pretty familiar here. Just because every character other than yours is a bird doesnt change any of that.(And as a sidenote, one annoying side effect of the characters all being birds: its kind of hard to tell them apart. Yes, their names are different, but unless youre ornithologically-inclined, the subtle differences between different types of white-coloured birds can be hard to grasp. Sure, theres the option of having the birds replaced with human portraits, but that kind of misses the whole point of the game.)", "date": "August 21, 2015", "grade": "B-"}
