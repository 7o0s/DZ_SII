{"name": "Super Blast Deluxe", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/04/super-blast-deluxe-review-ps-vita/", "text": "The core idea behind Super Blast Deluxe seems to be Donkey Kong barrels, but for an entire game. I dont think thats a reductive way of looking at it, either: one of its levels is called If DK could see me now, which basically captures almost everything you need to know about the game in just a few short words.Not everything about it, obviously. For example, it doesnt tell you that this game highlights why so few indie developers make 3D games. Obviously, the specific reasons vary, but in Super Blast Deluxes case, Raptus Games seem to have had trouble figuring out the whole depth perception thing. In early levels this isnt an issue, but as you get further into the game and you start bouncing from the foreground to the background, it quickly becomes a bit of a (literal) headache.At the other end of the spectrum, describing Super Blast Deluxe as a Donkey Kong clone makes it easy to overlook that its got a pretty fun score. I knew I enjoyed the music as I was playing, but I only understood the depth of my enjoyment when I woke up one morning and found myself humming it as I made breakfast. If thats not catchy, I dont know what is.Both the graphics and the music are just aesthetic asides, however, to the gameplayand on that front, yeah, Super Blast Deluxe is basically just Donkey Kong Countrys barrel levels stretched out to a full-length game. Your mileage on that will be directly correlated with how much you like those levels. If you loved them, youll have no trouble overlooking some iffy graphics. Hate them, and its inconceivable that youll enjoy this, no matter how good the music may be.", "date": "April 8, 2016", "grade": "B"}
