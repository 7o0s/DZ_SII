I think it might possibly be the best game Ive ever played. There wasnt a moment that went by while I was playing it that I didnt have an enormous grin on my face.And I have absolutely no idea how to write about it, since I dont want to spoil a moment of it for anyone who  like me  picks it up without any prior knowledge of what theyre getting into.Unlike most worries about spoilers, its not like The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe has some intricate plot that I dont want to give away. The story here is pretty barebones, and is told via voiceover just as the game begins: the eponymous Stanley works in an office where he responds to commands on a screen. One day, there are no commands, so he decides to go see his boss.And thats it. Thats literally the entire plot. If you were so inclined, you could play through that storyline in five minutes.The thing is, you might not be so inclined, and thats where the fun begins. Notwithstanding the official story, The Stanley Parable is really a game about games. Its a game about expectations, and about tropes, and player agency. You could describe it as fourth wall-breaking, but a) that doesnt capture the extent to which it breaks with everything youd expect about games, and b) Im not so sure it adheres all that closely to the other three walls, either.Its important to know, too, that even if The Stanley Parable is knowing and self-aware and self-referential, its not knowing and self-aware and self-referential in the way that most other games are. Where some games will poke fun at tropes while still using them, The Stanley Parable will poke fun at a trope, and then completely ignore it by going in a different direction, and then circle back to the same trope at a time when you least expect it.Its almost easier to say what The Stanley Parable isnt. For example, even though its original 2013 release date means that sometimes gets lumped in with the likes of Dear Esther and Gone Home (and Everybodys Gone to the Rapture, and Firewatch, and other such walking simulators), thats not accurate: I love those games, but theyre generally pretty linear narrative experiences. You quickly discover that doesnt describe The Stanley Parable.Likewise, there are moments where The Stanley Parable doesnt feel all that far removed from Portal. Both, after all, are absolutely hilarious, and both were originally built using the same game engine. (Plus, if The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe isnt my new favourite game, its only because Portal 2 remains undefeated for that title.) However, The Stanley Parable simply isnt a puzzle game, which means such a comparison could only take you so far.I know that its weird to rave about a game without actually saying what its about, or what happens in it, or what you do. But as I said, the joy of The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is simply playing it, and watching as everything unfoldsand unfolds againand then folds up and starts anew. It takes you in all kinds of unexpected directions with every playthrough, and you absolutely need to play it to fully understand what makes it great.", "date": "May 10, 2022", "grade": "A+"}
