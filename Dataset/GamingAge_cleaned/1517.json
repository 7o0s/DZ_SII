There may be some minor graphical enhancements (allegedly  I have to admit I cant see much of a difference), and a couple of new vehicles and superpowers, but basically, this is the same game that graced the last gen systems in 2013. If youre hoping for an all-new Saints experience, this isnt it  youll have to look at Saints Row: Gat Out Of Hell for that (though I cant say I recommend doing that).Not that I consider that to be in any way, shape or form a bad thing, mind you. I loved Saints Row IV on PS3, probably even more than my esteemed GA colleague did  and he gave that version of the game an A-. For me, every moment of the game was pure joy, an opportunity to run around Steelport with ridiculous superpowers destroying everyone and everything in my path, with the added bonus that the in-game city was set inside a computer simulation, which meant I never had to feel even the slightest twinge of guilt about harming innocent people. If I were to create my ideal video game, in other words, it would probably look a lot like Saints Row IV. Its probably also worth noting that I never came anywhere close to finishing it last time around, because I was just having too much fun zipping around Steelport with those aforementioned superpowers.Consequently, I welcomed the opportunity to revisit the game on a current-gen system. Not that its made a huge difference, of course. A dozen hours into Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, and Im still roughly where I was with the last-gen version: not anywhere close to being done the game, entirely because of the constant distractions that come along with being a superhuman inside a computer-simulated Steelport.So Im not talking from the perspective of someone whos finished the game, if that sort of thing bothers you. Then again, Id think that if ever there was a good excuse for raving about a game you havent finished, I was having too much fun with it to even bother trying to stick to the story missions counts as a pretty good one.Because seriously, without any hint of hyperbole or exaggeration, Saints Row IV: Re-Elected is one of my favourite games ever. It gives you slightly overpowered superpowers and sets you loose in a richly-imagined, vividly-coloured alien world. It never takes itself too seriously, but it never feels like its constantly winking at you, nudging you in the ribs with how clever it is. I mean, were not talking about Portal-level humour or anything; youve still got a dubstep gun, and the game includes all the DLC from the last-gen versionwhich means yes, youre rescuing Santa again in How The Saints Save Christmas. But at the same time, its a game that knows how to be silly, which is a pretty rare quality.Most importantly, though, Saints Row IV: Re-Elected works. You wouldnt think this should be a point in the games favourunless, of course, you played Gat Out of Hell and saw how badly that game came together. Here, by contrast, the only obvious glitches are the ones that are supposed to be there  and, Ill add, they look every bit as wonderfully weird as they did the first time around.", "date": "February 9, 2015", "grade": "A"}
