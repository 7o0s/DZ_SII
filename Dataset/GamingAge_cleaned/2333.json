{"name": "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/04/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced-edition-review-for-xbox-360/", "text": "People have been clamoring for a console port of the excellent PC Witcher series for years now, and were getting at least halfway there with this release, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition for Xbox 360. Granted, you might feel a little lost coming into the experience without having played the original Witcher, a game you should totally seek out if you have an opportunity to do so on PC, but Witcher 2 works really well as a stand-alone tale for the most part. Its also a damn good port, and hopefully it appeals to folks that havent played it before, because CD Projekt Red really poured a lot of work into pulling this off.The Witcher 2s biggest strengths lie with its excellent world, characters, and overall plot. Its one of the most well thought-out RPG stories youre likely to find across any platform, full of not particularly pleasant characters inhabiting a dark fantasy world thats certain to draw comparisons to the now wildly popular A Song of Ice and Fire novels (Game of Thrones) from George R.R. Martin. The world found in the Witcher 2 is often harsh, ugly, and downright cruel, just like most of its inhabitants.Battling through moral quandaries, demons, and other obstacles is Geralt of Rivia, the hero of the Witcher series, and the character you have direct control over. Geralt is a mutated human, specializing in killing monsters, thats suffered a severe bout of amnesia and is stuck trying to piece his life together. After the king he was in service of is murdered, Geralt now faces the harsh sentence of Regicide, and needs to clear his name. These two plot lines interweave a tale of political conspiracy, more kingly murder, former friends turned foes, and a number of complicated elements that propel Witcher 2 past normal video game plotline fluff. Seriously, this story is about as involved as you can get, and it doesnt hesitate to bathe you in terminology, names, and other lore that you might not fully grasp the first time through.Thats not to say that its overly confusing, just that youll find yourself actually needing to pay attention to the events around you. It also has one of the best morality systems in place Ive seen in a video game, in that there are a number of choices that need to be made that arent clearly good or evil. In fact, The Witcher 2 literally swims in a sea of grey moral issues, which really forces the player to make decisions based on what they actually think is right or wrong, as opposed to what the developers have deemed to be good or bad. These choices also have definite impact on not only the ending, but on current world events, and resonate throughout the story. Rarely do you make a choice that doesnt have some significant impact, which is another huge plus.Combat is another area where The Witcher 2 shines. Its based on third person melee fighting, wherein youll use either a silver-forged sword for fighting monsters, or a more standard steel/iron variety for human foes. You can draw either weapon at any time, and outside of switching hands they work pretty much the same way. You can opt to battle freely with limited assistance from the game, or lock on to a nearby opponent to focus your attacks. While locked on you can also hold down the right trigger to maintain a defensive posture, used for deflecting and parrying attacks.Its easy enough to switch between enemies, and youll often be fighting groups of bad guys. Its also remarkably easy to get overwhelmed when playing on any difficulty above easy, so dont approach this as a simple hack and slash system. Geralt is aided by both magic and other tools, along with a variety of potions and oils that can be applied to his weapons for added bonuses. Using magic to incapacitate one enemy, then tossing down a couple traps to tie up more foes, while honing in your attacks on the biggest bad guy in the group is often a great way to approach fights, but youll find that theres a lot of flexibility in the way you can approach just about every battle, which keeps the fighting from ever growing stale.And while I really do love this title, there are a couple things that constantly bugged me throughout. One has to do with the loot system, which I guess compares a bit to the current-gen Fallout titles. Theres stuff to pick up just about everywhere in The Witcher 2, a lot of which seems like random junk but most of which ties into the games crafting and alchemy systems, which are pretty involved. However, when youre looting different areas, houses, fields and so on, a lot of the materials are grouped together, and theres no good way to just pick up the exact items you want to grab. Instead you need to grab things as a group, which becomes problematic due to the fact you have a weight limit on what you can carry. Its easy enough to dump things you dont want after picking them up, but being able to fine tune what exactly Im picking up would have been great.Another issue, tied into the crafting system, is the way purchasing schematics/plans/recipes works. Once you buy or find a plan to build traps, potions, or whatever, you can just visit a shop, pay a little money, and build said item provided you have the materials available to do so. But with dozens upon dozens of things to craft, keeping track of the schematics you currently own becomes a little problematic, especially when youre going to buy new ones. Vendors will literally re-sell you plans you already have, and once you hit the last chapter of the game youll find yourself constantly running up and down the list of your own plans to make sure youre not double buying things. It seems like this could have been streamlined or handled better than it currently is, and I wasted a fair share of currency on making stupid mistakes like buying the same plan twice.Lastly, targeting NPCs for conversation is less than ideal with analog targeting controls. This is an area that a mouse would really come in handy for, especially within the inns and bars where the NPCs tend to gather. If theyre grouped tightly together it can be a pain to hit the one you mean to talk to. This is a pretty minor complaint overall, as a lot of characters are there to just provide filler text and dont bog you down in a literal conversation window, but its one area that I could certainly tell PC controls would provide a better experience.As a whole these complaints are pretty minor, they just stand out as something that gets more annoying to contend with the more you play the game, but do little to impact my overall enjoyment with the title. Its worth mentioning that the game is absolutely beautiful, and while Im sure theres some loss in fidelity transitioning from PC to Xbox 360, its a stunning port overall. Its easily one of the best looking titles on the hardware, with almost no technical issues marring its presentation.", "date": "April 16, 2012", "grade": "A-"}
