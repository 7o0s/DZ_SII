{"name": "Type:Rider", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/10/typerider-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "A lot of what I wrote about Type:Rider when it originally came out on PS4 and the Vita still applies now that its out on the Switch. Its still gorgeous, for starters. Taking fonts and turning them into entire worlds is a phenomenal idea, and the way that developers Novelab captured the essence of fonts like Times, Garamond, and Helvetica is pretty impressive. Add in a score to match, whether its Gregorian Chant (to go with Gothic) or upbeat jazz (Helvetica), and you can see why its easy to appreciate what Type:Rider does on an aesthetic level.On top of that, it weaves in the history of each font in a way that seems entirely natural. Type:Rider is an educational game that doesnt feel like one, which is always the best kind of educational game.As for my complaints from that old review? The good news is that performance isnt an issue on the Switch. Whatever technical problems I may have had a few years ago arent present here, which can only be considered a good thing, since it means its easier to enjoy those lovely graphics.Unfortunately, my other  bigger  complaint still applies. While controlling two dots instead of a single ball is certainly different, its also a massive pain to manoeuvre them across the platforms on account of it being super awkward. It also doesnt help that the games physics are inconsistent.Sometimes the dots have no problem jumping massive distances, while others they struggle to even go from one ledge to another one nearby. You can bounce the dots off walls to get higher, except when you cant. Sometimes the dots have a tiny bit of give in tight spots, while other times even getting in the vicinity of a pointy object makes them explode. It changes regularly without any warning, and it makes it hard to enjoy a game that shouldnt be hard to enjoy at all.Of course, seeing as Type:Rider is only $3 or so, its hard to know how harshly to judge the game. For that price, its almost worth it just to see the graphics in action  provided youre aware that dealing with lousy platforming is part of the price of admission as well.", "date": "October 30, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
