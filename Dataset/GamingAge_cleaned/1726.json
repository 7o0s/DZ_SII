{"name": "The Amazing Spider-Man 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/05/amazing-spider-man-2-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Before I say anything else about The Amazing Spider-Man 2, a quick comparison:In other words, if youre going into ASM2 on PS4 hoping for any kind of transcendent next-gen experience, youll probably wind up more than a little disappointed. There are a few places that have some nice-looking visuals, but in general, theres nothing here that you couldnt have gotten on the previous generations consoles.Now, if youre going into it simply hoping for another enjoyable Spider-Man game from Beenox, then the news is a little better. Basically, they took everything that made their last Spidey game good, and duplicated it. You want a big, populated New York City to swing around in? Its here. You want a bustling city full of people  and, more importantly, crimes to fight? Also here. Round that out with a whole bunch of bad guys to fight and all kinds of collectibles to find, and you have all the ingredients for a fun superhero game.Perhaps the best aspect of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, however, is whats not here. Specifically, rather than tying the game in with the events of the overstuffed, overlong movie, what goes on here is only tangentially related to the film. Theres some overlap, in that this game also features Spider-Man, Harry Osborne and company, but in general, the game is designed to stand up on its own merits.And, as I said, its got quite a few of those. Whatever drawbacks there may be in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 not looking as good as some other next-gen games, theyre more than made up for by the volume of other fun little things. The comic books floating around the city, all of which are stored in the comic shop of a man named Stan. The wide range of different Spidey suits waiting to be unlocked. The way crime seems to increase and get more and more urgent the further you get into the game. All those things and more go into making ASM 2s New York City a fun place to live.", "date": "May 15, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
