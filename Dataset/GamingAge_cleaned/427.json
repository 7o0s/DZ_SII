After all, it was made by Lightwood Games, who were behind one of of favourite games of the year-to-date, Pic-A-Pix Color  which Ive not only Platinumed twice (hurray for separate PS4 and Vita trophy lists), Im also closing in on 100%-ing it on the Switch too. I figured that if Fill-A-Pix was anywhere close to being as good as Pic-A-Pix, Id be in puzzle heaven.Unfortunately, its simply not. Fill-a-Pix may also be a picross game, but thats about all it has it common with Pic-A-Pix. It manages the odd trick of being both much, much easier than Pic-a-Pix, while also being much, much more tedious.There are two reasons for this. The first is just how the puzzles are designed. Youre still solving puzzles that reveal pictures, but instead of figuring out how many spaces are filled in for each row and column, instead youre going around a massive board and filling in squares based on how many squares around them need to be filled in. Its a small change, but it makes for a much more drawn-out, laborious experience.The other problem is the size of the puzzles: theyre massive, to the point that you can only ever see small parts of the whole at any given time. Youre basically just filling in squares with no sense of how they all come together, which only adds to the feeling of manual labour, and puzzles usually take at least 15 minutes to complete.It doesnt help much that the shortcuts  theoretically there to make the game more manageable  do nothing to alleviate these feelings of boredom. You can select blocks of nine squares, rather than going one at a time, and you can press the shoulder buttons to tell you where to find the nearest blocks you can fill inbut when you combine those two features, you reduce the game to nothing more than following directions.To be sure, that could be said about any game, when you really think about it. But the problem is that you dont have to think about it here, because its so obvious. Fill-a-Pix may come with some decent pedigree, but decent pedigree means nothing when the end result is so boring.", "date": "August 23, 2018", "grade": "C+"}
