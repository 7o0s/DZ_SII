{"name": "Island Maze", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/11/island-maze-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Island Maze is hard.I really cant think of much else to say about it, other than that its one of the hardest puzzle games Ive ever played. At only a couple of dollars and 28 puzzles, you might go in thinking its the kind of game you can blitz through in a short time, but that couldnt possibly be more wrong. It starts off with a quick level that gives you a rough idea of what its all about, and then from there it ramps the difficulty way, way up.Personally, I would have liked a slightly more gentle incline. Going from, like, 1 to somewhere near 100 right off the bat is a bold move, and it makes it hard to stick with Island Maze  particularly when, from that point on, it never gets any easier. But, I guess, if you want to make people feel like theyre getting their moneys worth on a game with 28 levels, theres no better way to do it than making them spend hours after hours after hours of trying and failing to figure out each of those levels.And, if youre in the mood for a challenge, Ill note that Island Maze is fairly pleasant to look at and to control. The graphics are bright and simple, and make it clear that, yes, youre moving a block around an island. The controls, too, are easy to figure out  even if youll have a near-impossible time getting them to work in the way you want to.But thats kind of the point, I suppose. Personally, I didnt feel like the pay-off was worth the investment (either in hours or in brain power), but if you want a game thatll tax your problem-solving abilities to their limits, Island Maze will give you just that.", "date": "November 13, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
