By any measure, Energy Hook has that title sewn up pretty easily, and nothing is going to touch it.FreezeMe shouldnt get too cocky, though, because its not all that far behind. In literally every respect imaginable, its horrible.The problems are pretty evident right from the get-go, too. Turn on FreezeMe, and youre immediately assaulted by a hideously oversaturated landscape. I dont have a problem with vivid colours  after all, one of the first things I do when playing any game is go to the settings menu and crank up the brightness levels  but everything here just looks unnaturally loud. Its an affront to anyone with working eyeswhich is appropriate, because everything else about this game is an affront in one way or another.Once your eyes stop feeling like theyre about to bleed, youll quickly discover the second sign that FreezeMe may not have had the best quality control: it has a weird Tendency to randomly Capitalize words in the Middle of sentences for No apparent Reason. Whether were talking about the plot, which is conveyed via little captions, or instructions, which you stumble across as you begin the game, everything reads as if it was pushed through an earlier, crappier version of Google Translate, and then rewritten by someone who just really loved capital letters.Id say this isnt the worst thing in the world, seeing as weird translations have been with video games almost from their inception, but here its a sign of a deeper problem: the text often doesnt make any sense. Im not sure if Rainy Night Creations were going for Alice in Wonderland-style whimsy, but time after time, Id stop to read signs and come away feeling like I knew even less than before. The game is full of incomprehensible explanations, which means that, frequently, FreezeMe will tell you to do something even though it hasnt explained how its possible to do it. An optimist may look at that and say something about the joy of discovery and learning by doing, but theres nothing here that should make you give this game that kind of benefit of the doubt.Of course, lousy visuals and incomprehensible text are just a precursor to uncovering FreezeMes deeper problems: literally everything else about it.I know thats a pretty massive generalization, but theres so much awfulness going on here, its hard to know where to begin. Youll constantly find yourself fighting with the camera and the controls. For the former, you have to deal with random, jerky movements that have no relation to what youre trying to do; coincidentally, thats the gist of my complaint for the latter, too. I lost track of the number of times the camera would reset itself in some absolutely useless position, and I have no idea why a default camera spot would be the top of the main characters head, or from behind her knees.That said, no matter how annoying moving the camera may be, it has nothing on how annoying it is to move your character. Theres absolutely zero fluidity to how she walks, runs or jumps. There doesnt seem to be any universal set of rules dictating when she can run or jump or climb in a straight line, and when she cant. It was pretty much a given that if I jumped on or towards someplace the game didnt want me going, Id immediately freeze in midair, and then glide, frozen, to the ground in a different direction. I got stuck in spots multiple times, forcing me to reset the levels I was in, and once I turned a corner and suddenly found myself falling through nothingness. And it should go without saying that swimming levels here are basically impossible.", "date": "October 3, 2016", "grade": "D-"}
