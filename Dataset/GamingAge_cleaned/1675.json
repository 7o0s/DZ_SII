{"name": "Atelier Rorona Plus: The Alchemist of Arland", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/08/atelier-rorona-plus-alchemist-arland-review-ps-vita-ps3/", "text": "If youre reading this review, youre probably already familiar with the Atelier series, but this still bears repeating: this image captures the essence of the franchise better than most reviews could. They may look like your typical moe games, with infantilized girls running around in age-inappropriate clothing, but the reality is far more complex. While you may get the odd hint of weird sex stuff, the games are all basically small business simulators dressed up in really frilly clothing.It should come as no surprise that thats true of the latest game in the franchise to come West as well. Like all the other Atelier games, in Atelier Rorona Plus youre playing as the titular character (Rorona, in this case), building up your little workshop and doing all the things  gathering supplies, building up your network of acquaintances/party members, fighting monsters and going on all kinds of quests, large and small  that generally encompasses.If you caught a hint of ennui in that last paragraph, thats wholly intended. While its certainly awesome that these games have an audience in North America sufficiently large for Tecmo KOEI to keep bringing them over, for someone whos only a casual fan of the series (that is: me), its starting to feel like the same game getting released over and over again. There are certainly some differences  Ill get to those in a moment  but if you were to place this game alongside the previous two Vita localizations, Atelier Meruru and Atelier Totori, youd find far more similarities than differences. Youre still a girl alone in the world, youre still doing all those aforementioned quests, and youre still in frilly pink bloomers.As I said, though, there are slight differences. For one, this game seems more streamlined than its predecessors; maybe Im just forgetting the timelines in the previous games, but it feels as though you have less time in Rorona Plus to fulfill all your obligations than you did in the other Atelier games. This, in turn, gives the game a slight sense of urgency that wasnt there before. Likewise, Rorona Plus has a bit more of an attitude than the other games. Its not like theyre suddenly aping Demon Gaze or Conception or Monster Monpiece or anything, but the way the characters interact has a bit of snark that wasnt as noticeable before.", "date": "August 4, 2014", "grade": "B"}
