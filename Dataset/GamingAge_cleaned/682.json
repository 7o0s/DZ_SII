If you want the too long, didnt read version of the review, basically I thought (and still think) that DOOM is absolutely fantastic. It still stands as one of the best first-person shooters of this generation, and even a year out the experience has managed to stick with me. If you havent played it still, absolutely do so, whether you do that via this new Nintendo Switch release or one of the other versions of the game.With that said, how does the Nintendo Switch port of DOOM fare? Pretty well I think, even if it doesnt hit the visual fidelity mark of other consoles. Of course, you likely knew that going in, but it is still worth pointing out that the game definitely doesnt look as good on the Switch. The framerate is cut in half to 30 frames per second, but thankfully it manages to hold that framerate in both docked and undocked modes. DOOM is also rendered at 720p, both when docked and undocked as well. And there are some definite differences when comparing textures and enemy models between the Switch and PS4/XB1. So depending on how much importance you put on visuals, then the Switch version of DOOM might not be your cup of tea.However, having a solid version of DOOM that you can play on the go is pretty fantastic. This is how Ive predominantly played the game so far, and it has been a ton of fun. It did take me a little bit of time to get accustomed to the feel of the right Joy-Con analog stick, as this is the only first-person shooter Ive played on the Switch. But that learning curve was definitely short, and in time I was blasting away at the demonic hordes on Mars with little to no issue. Seriously, the game runs very well when undocked, and if your big interest in DOOM on Switch is playing in handheld mode, youll be pretty happy with this release.Basically, if you want a portable version of DOOM, developer Panic Button has done a solid job with this port. However, being able to play this as a handheld game is definitely the only real draw with this version of the game. It cant match the visuals of other releases, but at the same time I dont think it makes any major sacrifices that keep the experience from being enjoyable. Just be aware that there is a considerable difference between the Switch and PS4/Xbox One versions visually, and I think youll be fine.", "date": "November 9, 2017", "grade": "A"}
