But online multiplayer seems like it would be such a perfect fit for the game  particularly at a point in the PS4s lifecycle where it hasnt yet achieved total ubiquity  its baffling that its not there.To back up a little, so that the preceding two paragraphs have a little more context: Towerfall: Ascension is a decidedly retro game in every aspect. Old-school graphics, simple combat, chiptune musichonestly, this is one of the few retro-inspired games that truly brings me back to being a young kid playing NES.With this dedication to the retro aesthetic comes two less-fantastic features: a hard-as-nails level of difficulty, and local-only multiplayer. These two things, of course, are intertwined. Judging from my experience with the 1-2 player mode  Ill admit right now that I wasnt able to play the 2-4 player mode, since I only have one controller  this game is freaking difficult, and it really seems like it would be easier to handle if youve got a second person playing with you. Since I imagine that most (or at least a substantial minority of) PS4 owners only have one controller, the option to play Towerfall: Ascension online seems like it wouldve had an amazingly positive impact  and made it a little easier to boot.That said, while the game wouldve been improved by such an addition, its not like it really suffers from the absence of it. Towerfall: Ascension is still wonderful, and I say that as someone who was thoroughly terrible at it. As I said, this feels like an NES game, but a really great NES game. The combat  jumping around a dungeon, shooting arrows at enemies and stomping on their heads  is addictively simple, unburdened by hard-to-learn mechanics. Whats more, even if the game is insanely hard, its got the same feeling of being difficult-but-relatively-fair that a lot of the best games from the late 80s had.", "date": "March 21, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
