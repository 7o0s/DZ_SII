{"name": "Dangerous Golf", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/07/dangerous-golf-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "I love the story behind Dangerous Golf: a bunch of former Criterion Games developers  including two of the studios founders  setting up a new shop, taking the knowledge they gained from creating the Burnout series and applying it to a new sport. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the combination of racing cars and destroying everything around me, the set-up had a lot of promise.Unfortunately, the actual game leaves a little to be desired. To some extent, this is because of Dangerous Golfs basic premise. Is there any sport in the world that lends itself to destruction less than golf? The only things that spring to mind are board games (which dont seem like they count) and maybe darts. Driving a golf ball inside a small space  which is essentially all youre doing here  feels like it pales in comparison to the kind of destruction youd get from, say, hitting a baseball in a small room, or shooting a hockey puck in a small room, or, really, anything involving any sport with larger balls.That said, great games can overcome even the iffiest of premises. The problem for Dangerous Golf, obviously, is that its not a great game. Its a game where you shoot a golf ball around the same rooms over and over again, trying to figure out what breakables have the highest dollar values rather than simply luxuriating in wanton destruction. At first, its kind of fun, but after a very short while it starts feeling more than a little repetitive.It doesnt help, of course, that the camera and the controls are both subpar. In both cases, it constantly feels like youre fighting with the controller, trying to find angles and directions that dont exist. Because the spaces are so small, youre constantly manoeuvring the ball into tight areas where, unfortunately, the camera inevitably seems to zoom in on the ball, and youre left trying to blindly push the ball in directions it either cant or wont go. Then again, its not exactly miles better in open areas; I regularly found that viewing angles sucked no matter where I tried to place the camera, and it often felt as though I was simply suggesting where the ball might want to think about going, rather than actually making it go in one direction or another.Perhaps Dangerous Golfs most egregious sin, though, is also something that seems like it shouldve been a gimme: theres almost no controller vibration. I mean, the controller vibrates a little when you sink a putt. But seeing as that comes only after youve just destroyed an entire rooms worth of stuff  all of which happens with no vibration  it seems like a pretty major missed opportunity.", "date": "July 28, 2016", "grade": "C+"}
