{"name": "Outer Wilds", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/07/outer-wilds-review-for-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "Outer Wilds is a hard game to talk about. On the one hand, its a mystery, so you dont want to know too much going in. On the other hand, its got an interesting hook, and if you go in ignorant of what that hook is, its going to seem very, very confusing until you realize whats going on.So Ill split the difference, and say that if you want to go in blind, just know that Outer Wilds is Groundhog Day but in space, and that you should check it out right now rather than reading any further. And if you want to know more, you should continue on to the next paragraph.Now that all those spoiler-averse people are gonewell, Im still not going to say too much more, since, as I said, the game is designed to be a mystery. You wake up one day, find out youre going to be launched into space, and that you need to explore your little world in order to learn a few basics first. And then, depending on how far you get with that, the sun will explode, and youll die.At which point youll wake up again, and live that same day over and again, until you solve the mystery and figure out how to break the cycle. As I said, its Groundhog Day, but in space.Even if thats Outer Wilds hook, however, thats not what makes it worth playing. No, thats in equal parts because it makes space exploration interesting, and because it blends so seamlessly with the mystery around which the game is built. The game is set in a solar system whose size is manageable  big enough that you get to feel like youre exploring as you soar through space, but not so big that visiting all the different planets is impossible. Likewise, piloting your ship is pretty intuitive, and the games map is easy to understand and to navigate, which makes exploring a breeze. To top it all off, your ship is pretty hardy, so even though youll need to learn some basics (including how to repair a broken ship), its not going to fall apart if you land a little roughly.As for the worlds, each of them are distinctive, and each of them hide their own mysteries that take a little bit of exploration and detective work to solve. Its important to remember that you wont be able to solve everything in one go  but equally important to remember that exploration, death, and rebirth are part of the games DNA, rather than things to be overcome.All of which is to reiterate what I said up near the beginning of this review: Outer Wilds is well worth checking out. Its got an intriguing hook and even better execution, and its one of the more inventive games youre likely to play this year.", "date": "July 12, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
