This isnt a terrible game. This isnt a terrible game.Thats not to say its a good game, mind you. In fact, if Im being completely honest, I kind of hated it. But looking at Gotham Knights objectively, Ive definitely played worse games, and it generally works as it should, so that has to count for something.But it doesnt count for much. It doesnt crash! is a basic standard of competence, not an ingredient for game of the year contender. Add on top of that the fact that the way that it works is incredibly boring and mediocre in every way imaginable, and you have a recipe for a game that falls far, far short of the standard set by the Arkham series.Admittedly, thats a pretty high bar to have to clear, and its one that not many games would match. But seeing as Gotham Knights was made by WB Games Montreal, who had a hand in creating one of those Arkham games, youd think that at least some of the magic from that series would be present here. But its not.Of course, the Arkham game that WB Games Montreal were responsible for was Arkham Origins, which is by far the weakest of the four (at least as far as Im concerned), so maybe it shouldnt be a huge surprise that Gotham Knights is so middling. But Arkham Origins was still solid, and Ive played it again recently enough that I can state confidently that Gotham Knights doesnt even live up to that game, let alone the others.What makes Gotham Knights so dull? A lot of the problems stem from the premise: its a Batman game without Batman, for the most part. Set in a world where Ras al Ghul has seemingly killed Bruce Wayne, you play as one of four members of the Bat-family: Batgirl, Robin, Red Hood, or Nightwing. All of them are trying  and failing  to fill Batmans shoes, and their lack of success is obvious not just in the story, but also in the game.You can take any of the component parts of the Arkham games, and look at how theyre adapted here, and you see a pale imitation. Take Detective Mode, for example: its an invaluable tool in the Arkham games, and it helps Batman uncover all the secrets Gotham has to hold. In Gotham Knights, it becomes AR mode, and it just feels off. You dont see through walls as well, and there arent as many interesting secrets to discover, and it just generally feels like a weak imitation of one of the best parts of the Arkham games.Similarly, the combat in Gotham Knights never feels anywhere near as smooth or fluid as it does in the Arkham games. You can chain together combos, sure, and you have different weapons depending on which characters you choose, but you never get the same visceral rush from shooting someone as Red Hood or slapping someone with a bo staff as Robin as you would from using your fists (and cape, and other bat-gadgets) when you play as Batman. Couple that with the fact that nearly all of the missions and side quests here consist of Go to point A, beat everyone up, and you can see why the game quickly feels so much like a chore.It should come as no surprise that traversing around Gotham isnt anywhere near as fun in Gotham Knights, either. I never realized how much fun it was to swoop around with that massive cape until I found myself at the top of tall buildings in this game, and my main option for getting around was to fire grappling hooks from place to place. Its nowhere near as smooth, and its hard to feel like youre instilling fear in the hearts of evildoers with a rope and a hook. Your other option is zip around on the Batcycle, but it, too, feels like a pale imitation of the Batmobile. It feels weak and underpowered, and after an initial burst of speed it always feels like youre just coasting along. One time I tried taking a shortcut through a pedestrian walkway, only to find myself stuck on a plastic-looking table in front of a cafe.Whats worse, the more of Gotham you see, the more same-y all of it feels. Youll run into the same bad guys doing the same things everywhere you go, and even after you clear them out from someplace, its not uncommon to return and find the same villains doing the same crimes the next night. I mean, it certainly makes it easy to earn all kinds of XP, but it makes the game feel very repetitive in a way that you never got in the Arkham games. What makes it even worse is that this version of Gotham is absolutely massive, but it none of the citys many neighbourhoods feel all that distinctive from each other.It probably doesnt help that the art style is so bland. Theres lots of neon and lens flare happening everywhere you look, and while that undoubtedly sets the game apart from the grim and grimy world of Arkham, it also strips Gotham of much of its personality. It feels too often like youre playing a game that just decided to slap on the Batman branding and names on something else entirely.In fact, that may be Gotham Knights most egregious crime: it feels like a cutrate, cosplay version of Batman and of the Arkham series. Nothing here is original, and everything feels like its striving  and failing  to emulate much, much better games. Theres an argument to be made, I guess, that if you stop thinking about it as a Batman game and just judge it on its own merits, its not half-bad  but even if you do that, youre still left with the reality that the game that doesnt come anywhere near matching up to what the genre is capable of. This is a mediocre game through and through, and Batman branding or no, its not really worth your time.", "date": "October 20, 2022", "grade": "C-"}
