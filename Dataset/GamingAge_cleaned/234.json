{"name": "The Spectrum Retreat", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/03/the-spectrum-retreat-review-for-xbox-one-pc-ps4-switch/", "text": "The Spectrum Retreat isnt going to win any awards for originality. It follows closely in the footsteps of Portal  which is to say it also follows in the footsteps of The Witness, and The Talos Principle, and Quantum Conundrum, and Qube, and Chromagun, andwell, lets just put the number conservatively of games that have been influenced by Portal over the past decade at a lot.Like all of those Portal clones (Portalikes?), it should go without saying that The Spectrum Retreat isnt as good as the original. But, also like all those clones, just because this game isnt very original doesnt mean its not good.For one thing, its gorgeous. The game is set in a mysterious hotel staffed by androids, and everything looks appropriately shiny, crisp, and sleek, with just the right amount of menace.Even more importantly, the puzzles in The Spectrum Retreat are top-notch. Like pretty much all the games that I listed up top, here youre playing around with different colours in order to unlock doors and create bridges and whatnot, but its too the games credit that it never feels any more derivative than it needs to. Moreover, the puzzles here present a good amount of challenge, mixing together rooms youll fly right through with rooms that may take a little more time to figure out.Where the game falls a little short of its influences is, like so many other Portal imitators, is the story. Its enough to keep things moving along at a decent pace, but theres little here that will stick with you after youre done. There are no memorable characters either, and, all in all, its more serviceable than anything else.But, on the bright side, all those lacklustre elements are in the service of a puzzle game thats pretty solid. The Spectrum Retreat isnt about to make anyone forgot Portal (or The Talos Principle, or The Witness, or), but it is enough to provide a decent enough diversion if youre in the mood for a moderately challenging experience.", "date": "March 28, 2019", "grade": "B"}
