{"name": "Family Vacation: California", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/06/family-vacation-california-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Im not going to pretend that Family Vacation: California is some secret hidden gem. Its a hidden object game  and not even a relatively complex one, like the sort Artifex Mundi churn out, where they add in lengthy stories and cutscenes with so-so animation. What you see here is what you get: a bunch of static screens, loosely tied together by a story about a family going on vacation, with the odd very basic puzzle thrown in to spice things up.And, yet, I loved it.Maybe its because  as I once learned to my surprise  I have shockingly strong feelings about what counts and what doesnt as a hidden object game. Unlike a lot of its competitors that try to dress themselves up, Family Vacation: California makes no effort to hide what it is.Or, maybe, its because a simple little game like this is all Im looking for sometimes. Its not going to make you think very hard, whether youre searching for randomly placed CDs and hats, or doing the most basic puzzles imaginable  but at the same time, it can be fun every so often to turn your brain off and not have to think at all about the game youre playing.True, at about $10, Family Vacation: California is probably a little overpriced  especially when you can buy the game on PC for less than $3 as of this writing. And, obviously, if you want anything more than just a hidden object game, Family Vacation: California wont give you that. But, again, if you want to turn your brain off and hunt for donuts and triangle rulers and all kinds of other weirdly placed junk, heres your chance.", "date": "June 8, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
