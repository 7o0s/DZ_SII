It was undeniably incredibly problematic in some ways  if not outright offensive  but it was also a heck of a lot of fun. It had a clear vision of what it wanted to be, and it made it awfully easy to get sucked into its wacky world, where you had to run around the streets of Tokyos Akihabara district, stripping people of their clothes in order to expose the hidden vampires. (Like I said: it was more than a little problematic.) The action was smooth, the writing was surprisingly funny, and it was just a great overall package. I went into Akibas Beat expecting something along those same lines.Big mistake.Akibas Beat is what happens when you strip (pun not intended) every bit of fun and originality from the previous game, and replace it with something wholly forgettable. Gone are the vampires and the free-ranging battles through the streets of Akihabara; in their place, you have a story that borrows liberally from Groundhog Day  yes, the Bill Murray movie  and generic JRPG mechanics. You go from Point A to Point B, trigger a long dialogue sequence, and then go on to do the next thing. The tedium of that occasionally gets broken up by the equally tedious dungeon-crawling, which features the requisite monster encounters and resulting button-mashing battles.While the games flaws are myriad  the characters arent interesting, nor is the story, nor are those aforementioned battles  I think you can get a pretty good sense of why Akibas Beat fails just by looking at the way it portrays its setting. I know literally nothing about Akihabara beyond what was featured in Akibas Trip and Akibas Beat. Based on that limited knowledge, however, I came away with two very different impressions. After Akibas Trip, I was impressed by how colourful and interesting and varied the neighbourhood seemed. After Akibas Beat, by contrast, I felt like Id just been running through the same indistinct streets for hours upon end. It didnt help matters that, rather than making all the other people look like people, Akibas Beat portrays bystanders as solid colours. However easier that makes it to tell important characters and NPCs apart, it just adds to the impression that youre running through Generic Tokyo Street #613857.Of course, it may just be that the games biggest problem comes from its concept. After all, youre running through the streets of Akihabara, doing the same thing day after day as you try and solve the various mysteries that are causing you to live the same day over and over again. While pretty much every game is built around some degree of repetition, here that repetition is baked into the games core and underlined repeatedly.", "date": "July 5, 2017", "grade": "C-"}
