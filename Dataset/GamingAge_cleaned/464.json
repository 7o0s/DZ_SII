There are certainly tweaks here and there  new 3D ballparks, new scouting reports, even more historical splits and stats  but for the most part, what youre getting here is what youre getting from the vast majority of annualized sports games: roster updates.Mind you, OOTP 19 probably offers deeper roster updates than you could possibly find anywhere else, which is a big part of what makes the game so attractive. If youre the sort of person who doesnt just want to set up the roster for your favourite MLB team, but also the rosters and lineups all the way down to the lowest short season rookie league (or even teams and leagues that arent MLB-affiliated), then OOTP continues to be your best  and possibly only  bet.Because OOTP 19 offers so much depth, my only complaints about it are more nitpicks than actual complaints. Case in point: the speed of the simulation. Even when I would try and go with an accelerated simulation, I still found my seasons being interrupted by all kinds of little email updates to me as GM, no matter how much control I had delegated to my Assistant GM and how few updates I was subscribed to. While I appreciate knowing how my injured players are recovering and how the All-Star Game voting is going, when you just want to zip through a season, those kinds of updates become kind of annoying.Likewise  and this complaint is truly down in the weeds  it felt like there was something wrong with how OOTP calculates WAR. I understand that different systems weigh talent differently (otherwise we wouldnt have the ongoing Baseball Reference vs Fangraphs debates), but it still felt like there was a marked disparity between pitchers and position players. While batters had no trouble displaying their value, it often seemed like pitcher valuations were off, giving far too much weight to Wins and Saves, and not nearly enough to ERA or WHIP.If were arguing about number weighting, however, thats probably a sign that OOTP is doing something right. After all, where else can you expand and realign Major League Baseball so that its schedule and its leagues make sense? Where else can you play around with Hall of Fame voting so that it rewards the most deserving players, and put in a voting system that isnt completely broken? And, looking beyond the MLB, where else can you organize Dutch, or Italian, or Korean leagues?Its also worth mentioning that those graphical upgrades are pretty neat. True, no one is going to confuse the on-field action here for what youd find in MLB The Show, but the fact that the games run smoothly and portray everyone on the field is a nice bonus.What matters most, though, is how well OOTP 19 delivers in terms of giving you full  and I do mean full  control over your favourite baseball franchise. And, unsurprisingly, it delivers a comprehensive experience, as it has for years now. Whether you want to build your team from scratch or take over the reins of your current favourite, you can do that here, and youll probably sink hours and hours and hours into it in the process.", "date": "July 18, 2018", "grade": "A"}
