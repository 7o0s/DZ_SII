{"name": "Beyond Blue", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/beyond-blue-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "Im not going to argue that Beyond Blue is the best game youre going to play this year. Even though my enormous backlog has meant I havent played a significant number of 2020s best rated games to date (by which I mean: I think Ive played two of Metacritics top rated games for the year), Im still fairly certain that most of them are probably better than this one.What I would say, though, is that Beyond Blue may just be 2020s most essential game.After all, think of how utterly awful 2020 has been so far. Im a pretty upbeat, optimistic person who tends to look for silver linings, and even Im willing to concede that between the global pandemic, various social injustices, and a worldwide economic downturn that rivals the Great Depression, this year has pretty much been every bit as stressful and depressing as the naysayers would have you believe.With all that in mind, sometimes its nice to play a game where all you do is sink beneath the waves and explore. And that, in a nutshell, is what youre doing in Beyond Blue.I mean, theres a story here. Youre part of a research team exploring the oceans, and its your job to swim around identifying and observing fish. Occasionally you have to use futuristic equipment to solve mysteries. And, via video and phone chats with colleagues, family, and friends, you slowly piece together the backstory for your character, a deep sea explorer/scientist named Mirai.But honestly, when youre swimming around, very little of that matters. Its easy to forget your troubles  both in-game and in the real world  when youre swimming through schools of parrotfish and clownfish, and identifying pods of whales, and basically exploring to your hearts content.Obviously, its not complex by any stretch of the imagination. Youre not going to get manufactured drama like you do in this years other diving game, Deep Diving Adventures. But that game allowed itself to get bogged down in silliness, not to mention overly aggressive sharks and absurd invisible walls. Beyond Blue has none of that. All you have here is an expert diver, state of the art equipment, and all the time you want to explore an undersea world thats absolutely gorgeous.", "date": "August 3, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
