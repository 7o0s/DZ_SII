{"name": "Cathedral", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/03/cathedral-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "I have no idea why youd play Cathedral when Shovel Knight exists. Or Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Or Carrion. Or Owlboy. Oryou get the picture. Cathedral is a metroidvania-style platformer at a time when variations on the genre exist in abundance, and it doesnt do anything to make itself stand out against the crowd.Mind you, it would still have this problem even if the competition was only Shovel Knight. While the nameless hero of Cathedral doesnt carry a shovel, in most other respects the game is awfully similar. Retro graphics? Check. Chiptunes music? Check. Knight as a main character? Of course. And, as I said, the gameplay is pretty much the same, right down to being able to hold your sword down to bounce off things.To be sure, theres nothing wrong with a bit of theft. I mean, Shovel Knight itself was an homage to plenty of older games, so its not like that game invented the genre.Whats more, Cathedral isnt a bad game. It works as its supposed to, and it imitates its source material pretty faithfully.But again, given how many other games arent just being inspired by metroidvania platformers of the past but also taking them in interesting new directions, it makes it difficult to recommend Cathedral. Its fine to play if youve already played all those other games, but if youre into the genre and you havent, then the best Cathedral can do is sit at the very end of your backlog.", "date": "March 2, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
