For those that have yet to play the game, you can check out my review of episode one here. As always, with these story focused games, I will keep the spoilers to a minimum, since that is half the experience.Episode two is where you start to see how dark Telltales take on the lore of Batman is and how well it works. Some of the changes are subtle, yet leave a lasting impression. For me, I welcome these changes because it makes for a fresh and memorable experience you can only get with Telltale Games.You begin with Bruce dealing with the fallout of the recent accusations of the Wayne family being in cahoots with crime boss Carmine Falcone. After spending a good amount of time as Batman in episode one, Bruce takes center stage this time around. During the first thirty minutes you meet up with Alfred in Crime Alley and try to remember what happened on the night his parents were killed.This was a great sequence for Telltale to revisit because it involves a significant change to the backstory. Its gradually revealed out as you progress in the episode. Bruce eventually remembers key words that were said by Joe Chill right before he pulled the trigger. This is just the beginning of the twists that await.Midway through the episode, Bruce meets up with Selina Kyle (Catwoman) in a bar to ask for her help in stopping a new threat to Gotham. You end up being confronted and have to kick some ass as Bruce. Its fantastic to see Bruce have a significant role during the gameplay that is usually foreshadowed in the comics.The shit really hits the fan later in the episode and literally had my jaw drop on numerous occasions. Some of what transpired was so unexpected, and to think we are only two fifths through the whole story. Seeing Bruces character development explored in a balanced way gave me a newfound appreciation of the man behind the cowl.", "date": "October 3, 2016", "grade": "A"}
