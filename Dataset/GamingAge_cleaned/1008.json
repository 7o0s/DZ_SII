When I casually mentioned to an employee at my local Gamestop that it was on my to-play list, he instantly launched into a spiel about how hard it was, and how it was brutally unforgiving towards newcomers from the get-go. As someone who generally isnt fond of games for which brutally unforgiving is adjective, that made me hesitant to even start playing.Turns out it was just another bit of bad advice from a Gamestop employee. Shiren the Wanderer is definitely hard, but not to the extent that newcomers shouldnt even think about playing it. Its more tough-but-fair, a game that includes a three-hour-long tutorial for a reason  the reason being, of course, that its a complex game that demands a lot out of players. Just play that tutorial, learn what youre doing, level up your character a little before heading out into the world, and youll be fine.Well, not fine. More youll die a little bit less. Because Shiren the Wanderer is definitely a challenging game. Its an unapologetically difficult, old school roguelike dungeon-crawler, and it forces you to be methodical as you make your way through each room.Ive played harder, though. Provided you play through the lengthy tutorial  which you really, really should; I cannot emphasize this enough  Shiren the Wanderer actually is much more user-friendly than other games. Combat is a relative breeze, as is moving. Your character levels up pretty easily. Organizing the many, many items you need to carry around is pretty simple. In almost every respect, its as if the developers understood how hard their game was going to be, and decided not to complicate things even further.Which makes the games one big flaw all the more puzzling. Shiren the Wander has a baffling save system. Theres no autosave, which is something I only learned after completing that aforementioned length tutorial. I completed the first, simple dungeon, my backpack full of useful items, arrived in the second location, stopped playingand then returned to discover that the game assumed I had moved on to the next dungeon, died, and lost everything Id earned in those first few hours. It was, to say the least, infuriating. Id have avoided had I just realized that the options menus Abort was another way of saying Save and Quit. For a game thats otherwise clear about most things, this one lack of clarity is surprising.", "date": "September 28, 2016", "grade": "B+"}
