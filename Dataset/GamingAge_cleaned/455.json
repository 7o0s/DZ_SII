{"name": "Ice Cream Surfer", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/07/ice-cream-surfer-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "If Ice Cream Surfer were available for a dollar or two, it might be worth checking out. At that price, you might be able to forgive its many (many, many) flaws, and just focus on the few things it has going for it. Its a silly little shmup where you play as the titular ice cream surfer battling his vegetable foes, who are led by a sentient broccoli with a tiny little moustache and a red armband. Itd be dumb, but for a bargain basement price youd at least feel like youre getting your moneys worth.However, Ice Cream Surfer is not a cheap App Store game. Its $8 in the PlayStation Store ($11 in the Canadian storefront!), which, quite frankly, is insane.True, it could be more expensive, but for that price, youd want a game that works. Ice Cream Surfer does not: one time I continued after dying, and spent the next five minutes flying through an empty sky, until I finally reached the end boss. Its quite possible this was just an incredibly baffling design choice, but I think the more likely explanation is that the mere act of clicking continue broke the games brain. That would also explain why, during another playthrough, pausing and continuing brought me back to the games title screen.For this price, youd want a game that could load within a reasonable time frame. Instead, every load screen in Ice Cream Surfer is an endless ordeal, involving lots of time spent watching absolutely nothing.Most of all, for that price youd want a game thats, you know, fun. Instead, you get six mostly repetitive levels, full of enemy bullets that are the same colour as power-ups and hit detection thats far too erratic to be tolerable.Id like to say that there are some points in the games favour, but that would be a lie. Ice Cream Surfer is a bargain basement App Store game masquerading as a mid-priced indie game, and at that price you should stay far, far away.", "date": "July 26, 2018", "grade": "D-"}
