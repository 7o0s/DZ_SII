I remember the mysterious and moody Metroid from the NES, but didnt have much of an attachment to the series back then. Fast forward to 2017 and you know who didnt forget about Metroid 2? Nintendo, thats who! They decided it was time to bring an under-appreciated classic into the modern era on a modern handheld with Metroid: Samus Returns on Nintendo 3DS.This time, Samus returns not just from her first outing in Metroid, but from the past and in a much more updated form. The amazing thing about this release of Samus Returns is that it isnt just a Virtual Console port or even a half-assed cash-in. This is the real deal, and more of a reimagining of what Metroid 2 could have been by todays standards.Probably the most surprising thing is just how well all the new additions work. I can deal with classic gameplay, but its not often when adding all the new stuff that decades of games have brought about feels like a natural addition to old-school games. I wonder what Super Mario Bros. 3 would be like with New Super Mario Bros. Gameplay? Hm, well maybe I dont. Some things might be better left untouched.But not Metroid 2. Despite the great game that I hear it was on the GameBoy, there is plenty of room to improve things. Nintendo got started right away by allowing Samus to do more than basic running and shooting. Right away you will notice that shes more nimble and able to jump off walls or aim her shots in all kinds of directions.Not only does this feel great in a 2D Metroid game, I feel like it makes me more free to take enemies down on my own terms. Theres also a counter attack which was tricky at first, but once I got the hang of it there was no stopping me. Time this move correctly and enemies are thrown back while spilling energy and taking a good amount of damage. Stupid aliens, dont they know who theyre dealing with?Everything about this game is great. I didnt notice any slowdown and the visuals are silky smooth. The music is also nice and moody, just like you want. Samus herself handles great on the 3DS circle pad, and abilities like a radar echo to reveal more of the map just bring the whole package to another level. Nintendo didnt pass up any opportunities when updating this game for todays gamers. Im still surprised at how much mileage they get out of something so simple like the morph ball.", "date": "October 3, 2017", "grade": "A"}
