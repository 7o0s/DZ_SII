The game is a re-release of a pair of Klonoa games, Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and Klonoa 2: Lunateas Veil, both of which failed to set the world alight their first time out, not due to any fault of their own. Door to Phantomile, was originally released back in 1997, when Super Mario 64 had suddenly made the 2D platforming of Klonoa (or, more accurately, 2.5D) feel tame by comparison. The game was re-released on the Wii in 2009, but like lots of other third party games on that system, no one really noticed it then either. As for Klonoa 2, even back in 2004 it was known for having low sales  presumably, in part, because 2.5D platformers still felt too much like a relic. If nothing else, then, the resurgence of 2D platformers over the last decade-plus makes KLONOA Phantasy Reverie Series seem less like an anachronism. In fact, if anything, competing against lots of other 2D platformers makes it even more clear how good these two games are. The levels are well-designed, with checkpoints and puzzles and enemies that feel like theyre spaced out just right. While you always have a clear logical progression, the games also give you just just enough opportunity to explore and uncover treasures, so that it doesnt just feel like a straight line from point A to point B.It also helps that both Door to Phantomile and Lunateas Veil look fantastic. Somehow, despite the fact the games were designed in the late 90s/early 00s, they dont look like theyre from the era. Rather, they feature bright, colourful worlds that pop off the screen. That said, there are certainly a few things here and there that show the games ages. For example, while I wouldnt quite call these games collectathons, theres still plenty of treasures here to uncover, giving you ample reason to explore some of those side paths. Theres also a somewhat odd mechanic  the games titular hero cant double-jump, but he (she? It? Im not even sure what kind of animal Klonoa is, to be honest) can grab enemies and use them as a means for double-jumping. Its not difficult, but it does take some getting used to, and it never feels like its a mechanic that other games would have been smart to borrow/steal.All in all, though, the two games are highly enjoyable. I dont know if KLONOA Phantasy Reverie Series is going to be the game that finally gives Klonoa the audience it deserves. But if theres any justice in the world, it will be.", "date": "July 25, 2022", "grade": "A-"}
