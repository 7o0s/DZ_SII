As someone whos lived through a pretty significant chunk of gaming history, I have no problem acknowledging that a lot of games from back in the day really havent aged poorly, and Id much rather play something from today than something from (or something slavishly indebted to something from) thirty years ago.Without Escape obviously doesnt agree with this sentiment, since its meant to be a tribute to point-and-click adventure games of the early 90s. The problem with this, of course, is that point-and-click adventure games of the early 90s often sucked, with impenetrable logic and pointless busywork of going back and forth between locations.In fairness, I should note that Without Escape doesnt have lots and lots of impenetrable puzzles, so much as it has one very stupid bit of game design at its core. But its so monumentally dumb, its enough to sink the entire game, as far as Im concerned. Ill give you a moment to stop reading, in case youre concerned about spoilers.Without Escape is a horror game, where you basically walk back and forth around your house, clicking on pretty much everything. You wake up in a room, you go downstairs to click on a clock, you find a key, you go back upstairs, you open a room, you go back downstairs, you find more keys, etc., etc. Its basically a loop of key-finding. As you near the end of the game, about fifteen minutes later, you  and here comes the spoiler  click on a desk, and find out that youve taken too long to get to that point, and then youre just stuck walking around the house until you quit and restart.At no point prior to that does the game ever tell you that youre being timed. Its a completely arbitrary design decision thats never communicated to you, but, again, its enough to render all your progress pointless and make you start over from the beginning  or from your last save, but since the game never tells you how fast you need to be going, youre safest just starting over.To be fair, Without Escape isnt very long. Losing all your progress, in this case, is only 15 minutes or so. So its not as if youve wasted hours on the game before realizing that youve overlooked something from the very beginning. But still, its a pretty disrespectful mechanic to build the whole game around an unseen, never-mentioned clock, and to make players start over again from the beginning for no apparent reason whatsoever.As for my feelings towards Without Escape up until I realized I had to play it over again: I was mostly indifferent, with some degree of annoyance at the fact you either had to turn the games brightness up so high that you couldnt see anything near a light source (which is a pain, since you have to read a note next to a lamp very early on), or you can leave it as is, and barely be able to see anything at all (except, I guess, for that note next to the lamp). Contrary to how the game describes itself, youre not solving any puzzles  just clicking around, picking up objects, and walking back and forth between rooms.", "date": "February 14, 2020", "grade": "D"}
