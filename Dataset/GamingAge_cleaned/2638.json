Ive played tonnes of Katamari games. Ive played a kart racer where the karts were people. In the past year alone, Ive played not just one, but two Choose Your Own Adventure-style visual novels based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft in the past year, not to mention a pair of noir-styled adventure games starring anthropomorphized animals. Ive played whatever Wurroom is.But Astrologaster is still in a class by itself. Heres how its eShop page describes the game:13 clients come to see you 5-7 times seeking advice for personal, professional and medical problems. By examining the stars in the sky, you diagnose and determine answers for your clients problems. As well as affecting the storyline, these choices will alter your clients satisfaction levels. Satisfied clients will write you letters of recommendation, and with enough of these letters you can obtain a medical licence from the University of Cambridge.As you can probably tell, theres plenty going on it that paragraph  the game is set in Elizabethan England, when medicine was still in its biles and humours stage, and you play as a doctor/astrologer who consults the stars to find causes for clients aches, pains, and maladies. On top of that, your character, Simon Forman, is based on a very real  and very controversial  doctor of that age.Somehow, though, this barely scrapes the surface of how odd this game is. Nowhere in that description, for example, does it mention the four-part choral harmonies that are liberally scattered throughout the game (and available on Bandcamp, if youre curious). It also leaves up the pop-up book-style visuals, with each new scene literally popping up as you turn the page.And, most crucially, it leaves out the humour (as in the funny stuff, not as in what Forman and his contemporaries believed in bleeding out of you). Astrologaster is very, very funny  provided you like not-so-subtle quips about men going in and out priest holes, all kinds of euphemisms for sex (my favourite being strumpy-humpy), and lots of other bawdy humour that, truthfully, wouldnt have been totally out of place in some of Shakespeares comedies. It also undoubtedly helps that not does the game feature plenty of solid writing, it also features a cast of voice actors who make the dialogue come alive.To be clear, Astrologaster probably isnt for everyone. Humour is, of course, very subjectiveand thats without even factoring in the choral music. But if youre looking for a game thats completely unlike anything else out there, look no further, because this is definitely it.", "date": "June 3, 2021", "grade": "A"}
