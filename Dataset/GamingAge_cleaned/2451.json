And how you react to that sentence will tell you pretty much all you need to know about this game and whether its for you.If, for example, you read it and instantly zeroed in on either Fatal Frame or Japanese horror, its safe to say youll be all over this game  and for good reason, too. Whatever its flaws  and Ill get those in a moment  it hits the absolute perfect notes when it comes to atmosphere. Every moment of the game feels creepy. Whether you want to attribute this to the ghostly looking characters (even the non-dead ones), the rickety old buildings, or the general vibe that something unpleasant is lurking just at the edge of your vision, theres hardly a moment that goes by here that doesnt feel unsettling. For a horror game, thats a pretty important aspect to get right.Whats more, its core mechanic  youre armed only with a camera, and you need to take photos of all the ghosts lurking about  is pretty well-executed. Thats been one of the essential elements of Fatal Frame going back to the beginning, and its done just as well here. In fact, given how gorgeously creepy the game looks, you could probably even argue that the mechanic has reached new heights for Maiden of Black Water.That said, its important to remember the second half of what I wrote up there: Maiden of Black Water is a remake of a game that first came out in 2014 on the Wii U  and not only does it feel like it, it also has a lot of habits that will make it feel even older.By this I mean that its a very slow-moving game. While this can be a key component in the kind of classic J-horror that Maiden of Black Water draws from, its not nearly as fun when youre the one in charge of the action. There are only so many times you can slowly walk down an empty hallway or through a watery room before it starts to lose its appeal. Likewise, seeing as one of the key parts of the game is escaping from ghosts, its kind of silly that the characters show so little urgency, even when theyre running for their lives.Its also hard to shake the feeling that this game was built with the Wii-U and its gamepad in mind. While the transition to a more traditional system isnt terrible, it frequently feels as if the game expects you to be quicker on your camera trigger than it allows for. While I never played it on Wii-U, its easy to imagine how it would work on a TV-gamepad combo. Here, by contrast, youre often expected to switch to your camera without a whole lot of warning or opportunity to do so, which feels at odds with the games otherwise slow pace.Neither of these issues are enough to completely sink Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, of course. As I said up top, its all about what youre expecting out of it. If you dont mind a horror game that doles out its frights at a snails pace, then youll find plenty here to enjoy.", "date": "January 5, 2022", "grade": "B"}
