{"name": "Bugs vs Tanks!", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/06/bugs-vs-tanks-review-for-nintendo-3ds/", "text": "Heres a phrase that probably doesnt pop up too often in reviews of download-only 3DS games: morally abhorrent. And yet that seems like the best way to describe Bugs vs Tanks.I mean, its not very often that you play a game in which the Nazis are the good guys. Yet thats exactly what you have here. And Im not talking Nazi analogues or Nazis from some crazy alternate dimension, or Nazi zombies, or anything like that. I mean that, in Bugs vs Tanks, you play as a Panzer-riding, genocide-doing, Hitler-loving Nazi straight from the 1940s.Admittedly, the whole genocide and Hitler thing isnt exactly stated outright. And, obviously, a game in which you and your squad mates have been shrunk down to the size of bugs isnt exactly going for historical verisimilitude. But at the same time, you  playing as a German  are riding in tanks drawn from the historical record, and the games intro explicitly places the game in early 1940s, and you rage about the dirty Allied forces that did this to you. Theres really only one way you can take that.Dont get me wrong, I think its perfectly possible to create works of art in which morally dubious characters are the protagonists: think Lolita, in either book or movie form. Heck, think modern day gaming heroes like Nathan Drake or Kratos, if you want something a little more relevant to this particular discussion. But at least those examples pause every so often to remind you that, whatever charm the protagonists may possess, theyre not exactly saints. In Bugs vs Tanks, by contrast, youre supposed to help the Germans on their way so that canwhat, get back to gassing Jews?You might think that Im overreacting, that I should just look at Bugs vs Tanks as some silly little downloadable oddity, that I should put politics aside and just focus on the game play. I mean, inherent ideology aside, what youve got here is essentially Earth Defense Force-lite, but shrunk down to its basic components so that it fits on the 3DS  and God knows I love EDF.", "date": "June 27, 2013", "grade": "D-"}
