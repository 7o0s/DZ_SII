Im not exaggerating in the least when I say that the games lowest difficulty level sucks every possible bit of fun out of the game. You can win literally every single race just by pushing your cars acceleration up to the highest level and keeping your thumb in that same spot until you cross the finish line. Normally winning easily doesnt bother me too much, but when a paperweight could do pretty much everything the game asks of it, it crosses a line for me.Of course, its not like the game gets any more fun when you play it on Normal or Hard, either. Normal suffers from the same issue as Easy: its extremely beatable if you accelerate to the max right out of the gate and stay that way for the whole race. I was able to beat entire courses without even looking at my screen, which doesnt seem like the sort of thing that should be happening. All I had to do was take the money Id won after trouncing my Easy competitors, up my tire grip up to the max, and then sit back and let the wins roll in.Hard, by contrast, suffers from the opposite issue: its virtually unwinnable. Crashes happen in HTR+ Slot Car Simulation at totally random points in the race, even as opponents seem to have no difficulties whatsoever leaving you in their dust. It may be a case of the game demanding a little more nuance from you once you reach a certain level, but if thats indeed the case, it feels like it shouldve spent a bit more time asking you to learn something  anything at all, in fact  during its first two-thirds.Mind you, even if it did, Im not sure it would help all that much, since no amount of skill would help you overcome the games glitches. And, unfortunately, those happen with an alarming regularity. I lost track of the number of times my car would get placed beneath the track (at least, I think it was beneath the track  the available camera angles couldnt find it, so I just assumed), or suddenly reset even though it seemed to be going along fine, or suddenly slow down just as it was approaching a loop. Normally I might blame some of these things on user error, but when the game only asked that I pressed a button in a single spot, Im going to go ahead and absolve myself on that.", "date": "December 4, 2015", "grade": "D+"}
