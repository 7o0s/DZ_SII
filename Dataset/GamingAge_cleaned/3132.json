{"name": "Delta Squad", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/12/delta-squad-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Words cannot convey just how inessential Delta Squad is. Not only is it a completely forgettable, thoroughly uninspired top-down shooter, its also a sequel  for some reason  to last years FullBlast, which itself was a completely forgettable, thoroughly uninspired shmup. Im not saying every game needs to have a reason for being, but I played through FullBlast last year, and I cant say that theres ever been a single moment in the past year where I even remembered its existence, let alone found myself wondering what had become of those anonymous spaceship pilots.Of course, Id be completely and utterly indifferent to Delta Squad even if it wasnt an inconsequential sequel to a game that you almost certainly didnt play (nor, really, that you had any reason to play). Its just that generic. Its a top-down shooter with nothing in the way of personality or style, where you run around a map shooting at zombies and evil soldiers, all to stop some evil general. I mean, kudos to the game for even putting together a modicum of plot, but who cares about any of this?Whats more, Delta Squad is designed to be played as part of  you guessed it  a four-player squad, and its pretty much impossible to do anything solo. You have limited lives and firepower, and even if individual enemies arent much  beyond the tanks and turret guns, which will kill you pretty quickly if you dont avoid them  collectively theyre almost sure to overpower you eventually if youre on your own. I suppose the game deserves some credit for trying to revive couch co-op, but I cant imagine why youd want to waste friends time on something as thoroughly shrug-inducing as this.But again, theres no way the presence of three friends  or even AI  would make Delta Squad stand out, or even make it worth playing. Its a dull way to spend a couple of hours, it doesnt do anything even remotely interesting, and not even the promise of a patented Ratalaika Easy Platinum should be enough to make you want to play this for even a single second.", "date": "December 3, 2019", "grade": "D"}
