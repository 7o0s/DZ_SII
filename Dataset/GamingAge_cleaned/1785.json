{"name": "South Park: The Stick of Truth", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/03/south-park-stick-truth-review-pc/", "text": "Maybe you dont watch a lot of South Park. I know I dontnot because I detest the show, but it never demands my attention. I dont crave it. Ive enjoyed what Ive seen, and happen to like the movie. This was important to me when I sat down to play The Stick of Truth, because while Trey Parker and Matt Stone have been working for over a decade to establish a very specific type of humor, its success has always been in accessibility. The fact that its not necessary to marathon four seasons and still laugh at the toxicity of gingers or watch Stan puke out of nervousness is remarkable, and bringing such a close approximation of the show into the world of games should maintain that charisma.Im here to talk about whether it does that or not.If you followed any of the marketing then you know that half of the games jokes write themselves, starting with you: the new kid. A blank slate, youll design a kid to your liking. Immediately, the inferred silliness of features is encouraging, with little touches like a teardrop tattoo for an elementary school student, followed by the class youll assign your character to. Somehow I made it to this portion without prior knowledge to the Jew class, which is an immediate barometer for what foot were starting on, and irresistible in conforming to that tone.So there you are, the new kid in town. Your parents seem to care too much about how youre doing after whatever happened before the move, and everyone wants to know why you dont have any dialog. Within the first 10 minutes, your dad is a jerk to you, the game ignores your input name for Cartmans suggestion of Douchebag, and I think there are some stray underpants in a dresser drawer that youre going to collect five of. In all this, youre recruited to steal back the stick of truth from the LARP rival elves, and were off.The story plays out in typical fashion of the shows four characters arguing over some petty grievance (in this case who has a tree branch), which inevitably goes as far off the rails as youd expectin terms of both scale and absurdity. This is miraculously stretched over about 12 hours of game, as opposed to the typical half-hour structure.Oh right, I almost forgot. This game is 12 hours long at best; 11 if I believe the save file. Should we talk about that? Is that a problem?While its traditionally better to leave your audience wanting more than it is to overstay your welcome, Stick of Truths length will find audiences divided. Im a believer that this game could have easily been three times as long, but at what cost? A great majority of the game is written and voice-acted by just two guys, with several thousand lines of dialog to think up and make funny. If thats not strapped for resources, then I dont know what is.In some ways the length of South Park is a blessing, saving the limited scope of aspects such as VO barks from risking fatigue, and not drawing out hours with the tedium of turn-based battles. Its a smash-and-grab game that plays out (except for the awful Canada section) at a breakneck pace reflective of what the show delivers in about 20 minutes.While there are things to be grateful for in Stick of Truths succinct nature, its the underlying weaknesses that make it look better for not being so long. The battle system, for instance, is initially fun, but on the games default Normal difficulty, enemy encounters become routine at best once you figure out that inflicting a bleed debuff (or any for that matter) is greatly overpowered.Stick of Truth borrows heavily from other RPGs, seemingly more on the traditional and JRPG side in its turn-based nature, and ultimately plays like a watered-down Paper Mario. Good for it that its able to piggyback on the inventive nature of Nintendos active turn-based battles, but without an understanding of what makes turn-based combat sing, the mark of an imitator is apparent throughout the game.Theres no shame in borrowing from other games if its inspired, and Stick of Truth at least understands that open-world gameplayalong with its battle mechanicswill thrive based on character. While the battles become lukewarm, the theatrics of special attackscoupled with the precious animations and volatile voiceworkare enough of a staying factor to keep the mood going. Im remiss to say that Im pretty sure that thanks to the basic gameplay, I maybe only used a handful of special attacks, and never had a need to experiment with different characters in most of the combat.This sucks, and it shouldnt. Within the first few hours, we run into the guy from City Wok, referencing an episode I was lucky enough to catch offhand, and after fulfilling a mission to rid him of Mongorians are granted the option to use him as a summon. Out of curiosity I used him once, one of my favorite characters in the South Park universe, because there is never a need to use summons outside of the entertainment factor. Youre overpowered enough, as it is, and they give you a handful of these things.Probably the greatest misstep here is that summons arent allowed for use in boss battlesthe only place theyd really come in handy. Its a shame that the game has all these great ideas around, because it never really comes up with a good reason to put them to use. A few tried-and-true weapon/ability combinations meant I would never experience with different stickers (for buffing weapons), clothing presented a handful of garments with superior effects, and for all the little bits of referential item descriptions, I was never compelled to look twice at all the text someone worked hard to make worth inspecting items over. Items that are only good for pawning off, mind you.While small in scope as a game (there are maybe a dozen sidequests overall), I probably managed to miss a lot of gags just due to how accessible Stick of Truth wants to make itself as an RPG. It begs to be mainlined, never compels you to poke around, and quickly sets a precedent for frivolous looting. These factors belittle what is otherwise a fantastic realization of what a licensed game can be capable of, especially one with such a flexible sense of humor.Stick of Truths trademark cutout visuals, coupled with the situational commentary on topics from Facebook to abortion, are representative of the crass wit that the show is known for. Al Gore spamming you with messages about ManBearPig gets a light laugh, while the nighttime segments have the audacity to feature some of South parks filthiest material yet. Despite the strong translation into game narrative, this isnt one you want to marathon.In fact, Stick of Truth is more successful when played a few hours at a timeif only for the fact that loading the game opens with the well-known guitar strum on an establishing shot of city limits. Youll otherwise grow tired of the silliness, even if the game continues to come up with fun takes on video game staples.The sense of place is strong, conferred by the visuals and voicework, but also in the LARP-y overworld music. Little costume touches, cameos, and thoughtful planning of the towns design similarly compliment the notion this is a seamless move into an extended stay in South Park, which by its end feels short-lived. This isnt just apparent in repeatedly mentioning its length, but in my experience having hit the level cap of 15 with at least three hours of game left.Talk about a buzzkill. Are they serious? Theres no way I maxed out levels, I must only have been reaching the third act. I guess thatll teach me to confront every enemy I see in the wild.  I can only hope that this doesnt turn out to be the general experience for most players.South Park: The Stick of Truth excels at maintaining its pedigree as a comedy showcase, but is easily winded as a game. Im happy to recommend it for its entertainment value in meta-commentary and sophomoric gags, but the only thing its good for once youve finished is to lend to a friend. The length is less to blame than the overall design as an RPG, where players will notice things such as a striking contrast between pacing when considering how strong the story is. Stick of Truths main concern ultimately lies in its ability to match a good game to a really entertaining premise, which is a far more alienating factor than whether people like your show.", "date": "March 4, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
