{"name": "Cosmophony", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/05/cosmophony-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-ps3/", "text": "A reductive view of Cosmophony would be, roughly, as follows: its $5, it has five levels, and therefore, youre paying about a dollar a level. Yes, each level has a practice run to try out before you move on to the main course, but basically, when you get right down to it, the games only got five levels. And from that reductive  and possibly strawman-ish  point of view, you might not think youre getting much bang for your buck.You might even continue to think that after the first level of this musical rail shooter. After all, its not particularly difficult, and odds are good that it shouldnt take you too long to beat it. Based on that first impression, you might be left feeling a little ripped off, and maybe a little concerned that Cosmophony is just another mobile port/money grab.Then you hit the second level, and you quickly realize just how wrong that line of thinking is.Because even though Cosmophony only has five levels, its important to recognize that four of them are hard. Like, insanely, absurdly, impossibly, hard. So hard that unless you have ridiculously great reflexes  which, Ill note, I do not have  its going to take you a long, long time to even beat each of those levels, let alone getting to 100% on each level.A major part of the games difficulty stems from the fact that each level has one-hit kills. It may try to soften this with a little bit of handholding in practice runs (Awww, you died? Well take you back to the checkpoint! I can almost hear the game saying encouragingly), but thats just to lull you into a false sense of security. If you want to beat a level, you have to beat it thoroughly. No checkpoints, no mistakes: just timing every move perfectly  and, if youre really masochistic, you can try to shoot all your enemies, too, while youre at it.The visuals and soundtrack dont help matters much, either. Now, both are undeniably pretty cool. Cosmophony features a pulsating drum & bass soundtrack courtesy DJ Salaryman, and I have no doubt that if it werent scoring my endlessly repeating deaths, Id love it. Similarly, the game looks all trippy, with dazzling visuals that are equal parts Rez and Lumines.The thing is, when you put them alongside a game that moves so quickly and that requires such precise timing, they make its already insanely high degree of difficulty that much harder. Its hard to enjoy these throbbing beats when theyre not quite in time with your moves; youre constantly wanting to move in sync with what Salaryman is laying down, but that just kills you instantly. Likewise, the visuals look fantastic, but theyre also distracting  and in a game with no margin for error, thats fatal.", "date": "May 29, 2015", "grade": "B"}
