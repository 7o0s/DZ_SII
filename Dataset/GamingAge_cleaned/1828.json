{"name": "Sorcery Saga: Curse of the Great Curry God", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/12/sorcery-saga-curse-great-curry-god-review-ps-vita/", "text": "At its core, Sorcery Saga is a pretty simple, straightforward game: its a dungeon-crawler, through and through. A sadistic, throw-your-Vita-against-the-wall-hard dungeon-crawler, to be sure, but a dungeon-crawler nonetheless.Im saying that up front because its an awfully easy thing to overlook once that subtitle  Curse of the Great Curry God  comes into play. See, even if the game itself is easy enough to classify, genre-wise, the story Compile Heart built around the dungeon-crawling is flat out insane. A rough outline of it: youre Pupuru, a plucky young girl out to save her friends curry restaurant from being muscled out of the market by the opening of a giant curry chain restaurant thats just set up shop in the neighbourhood. To do this, you have to assemble the ingredients for a legendary curry, but youre being thwarted by the owner of the aforementioned curry chain, who overheard your plans and has sent his own team in search of those ingredients.Also, youre accompanied in your quest by something that looks kind of like a Pokemon, but that needs to be fed constantly or else it starts crying and attracting the attention of monsters. And you occasionally chat with a disturbingly young-looking girl dressed in, for lack of better description, a boob sticker and a waist bracelet, except her half of the conversation consists almost entirely of her muttering about the titular Curry God, along with a bunch of indifferent asides. And theres a demonic prince whos convinced that Pupuru is his future wife, and whose father is possibly the Pokemon-ish creature.You know, just your typical plot.As I said, though, getting too far into the weeds of the Sorcery Sagas story can obscure the fact that this game is, at its core, shockingly simple. I mean, you definitely should allow yourself to get drawn into the story, because its so utterly bonkers that its endearing and hilarious, but all the crazy conversations are, ultimately, just passing the time between the game trying to kill you.Actually, saying the game is trying to kill you drastically overstates how effective youll be in this game. Because, truthfully, you probably dont stand a chance. Sorcery Saga expects you to grind your way through room after room, carefully building up your stats, and then do it all over again in the next dungeon, where theyve not-so-helpfully reset your stats back to the first level.Ill say that again, because it bears repeating: no matter how strong you may grow to be in one dungeon, it doesnt matter for the next one, because you always start back at Level 1.On the upside, careful crafting will at least give you a fighting chance, since youre allowed to carry stronger weapons into each new dungeon. Of course, if you die (which you most certainly will) then you lose those weapons, and everything gets pushed back to zero. So its almost like youre grinding through level after level for no reason at all. Fun!", "date": "December 20, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
