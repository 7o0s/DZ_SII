{"name": "The Golf Club", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/09/golf-club-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "EA Sportss PGA Tour series has taken the year off, and the folks at HB Studios Multimedia have decided to take it upon themselves to fill the void with their new golfing simulation: The Golf Club. When it was first announced, I was excited (if not optimistic) that I would not have to go a full year in limbo for my virtual golfing experience. Alas, it looks like I will still need to wait for my golfing fix. While The Golf Club plays a fine game of golf, there are just too many hiccups  from the presentation, to the lack of modes and options  to really recommend this title for anyone but the diehards who cant put it off a year.Besides the quite expensive price of $35 for a digital only title, The Golf Club is too rough around the edges and feels like a pay to play beta rather than a finished product. Visually, the frame rate stutters, the players and courses are bland and lifeless (except the water), the audio is dull and fake sounding; from the less than enthusiastic announcer, to the plastic sound of the ball hitting the fairway. There are only single round and tour modes, with no stat tracking career mode at all. Let us not forget the fact that there is not one PGA licensed course or player to be found. The only real less than generic aspect is the course creator which is fantastic! The fact that you can literally recreate (if you have blueprints) any of your favorite real to life courses with simple drag and drop controls is outstanding. Sure getting used to it with a controller may take some time, but once you have it down you will be creating courses faster than Tom Fazio.That being said, I dont want to beat up on the game too much as there is a solid game of golf to be found here, but it comes at too much of a price for this reviewer and golf fan to really recommend. Sure the game can be enjoyable at times, you can play through 18 holes in rather short order, and being able to rate and share courses is a plus. Id be lying if I didnt say the play mechanics werent true to life, but the game is just too barren to call itself a nearly full priced title. Even at $19.99 I would have a few qualms with the games lack of content but at least I would have fewer reservations in recommending it.", "date": "September 9, 2014", "grade": "C-"}
