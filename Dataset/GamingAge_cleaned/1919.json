{"name": "Game Dev Tycoon", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/09/game-dev-tycoon-review-pc/", "text": "Ill say this for the makers of Game Dev Tycoon: theyve got chutzpah. Lots and lots of chutzpah. After all, they gained some fame a few months ago when they revealed that their games anti-piracy measure waswell, piracy. Anyone playing a cracked version of Game Dev Tycoons would eventually find their in-game game studio hit by pirates, who would illegally download all the studios releases and eat away at its profits.The irony of it all  or brazenness, or chutzpah, or whatever you want to call it  is that Game Dev Tycoon is, itself, one giant rip-off of another game. Anyone whos ever played Kairosofts Game Dev Story on their iOS or Android device (which should be everyone reading this, since that game is awesome) will find that the similarities between the two games are about as extensive as you could possibly imagine. Both are essentially journeys through the history of video games from the perspective of a game developer. In both cases, you start out creating PC games, and over the next few decades you get an opportunity to develop games for very thinly-veiled analogues of every major system since the NES.There are some minor changes here and there, I guess. In Game Dev Tycoon youre given news fromsomething, rather than Game Dev Storys ever-present secretary. In Game Dev Story, you annually buy Red Bull to keep your employees fresh and motivated, while in Game Dev Tycoon, its vacations that keep your employees spirits up. In Game Dev Story, eventually you reach a point where you can build your own console; in Game Dev Tycoon, the opportunity to build and license your own game engine comes much, much sooner. Game Dev Tycoon has a few more systems available  including not only the PS4, Xbox One and Wii U, but also iDevices, Microsoft Surface and the Ouya  though this is probably because some of them werent around when Game Dev Story came out a few years ago. Most noticeably, Game Dev Tycoon looks significantly nicer, though this is to be expected when you consider were talking about a modern-day PC game versus a three-year-old iOS game that itself was a port of a Japanese game from the late 90s.On the whole, though, the experience is basically identical. Your goal in both games, ultimately, is to find the right combinations of genres on the right systems, and to sell as many copies of your games as possible. Running short on cash? Then, as you did in Game Dev Story, you can take on extra contracts to top-up your bank account. Want to increase your fame? Then buy ads for your games, or make a splash at the annual E3 stand-ins.Oddly enough, however, Game Dev Tycoons major flaw isnt at all like that of Game Dev Story. If the latter game has a problem, its that by the end its too easy to make a great game  you can intentionally release a flawed, buggy mess on a dead system, and itll still get near-perfect scores and sell like hotcakes. In Game Dev Tycoon, by contrast, randomness seems to rule everything. You can create a game that has off-the-charts design and tech scores only for it to get savaged by the games media and ignored by consumers, just as poorly-made games can garner great scores and sell in the millions. While this may be true to life to some extent, such complete and utter randomness makes it a lot harder to enjoy the game.Whats more, because theres already a platonic game development sim ideal out there, its easier to notice when things are missing that should be here. Case in point: Game Dev Tycoon is completely devoid of humor. While Game Dev Story wasnt hilarious by any means, it at least had some humorous aspects, and the absence of any of those here is noticeable.", "date": "September 24, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
