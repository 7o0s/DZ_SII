{"name": "Strike! Ten Pin Bowling", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/02/strike-ten-pin-bowling-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Heres my big problem with Strike! Ten Pin Bowling: its $10 on the Switch, and free in the iTunes store.I know, I know: theres not really any such thing as a free mobile game, and Strike! is no different. You need to pay about $10 if you want to unlock everything the game has to offer in the mobile version (all of which comes included in the Switch version), which means the difference between the two versions is arguably negligible when you get right down to it.But still, even if youre not getting everything in that free version  going by the names of the in-app purchases, it seems like youre paying for different balls, as well as a couple of minigames  youre still getting most of what Strike! has to offer, including the parts that are the most worth playing.That said, if you dont mind paying a Switch Tax, theres a lot to like about Strike! Its more or less a straightforward bowling game with a couple of minigames thrown in to pad out the game, but that doesnt make it any less fun  especially if, like me, youre playing it solo in handheld mode. Its there that you see the game as it was designed to be played, with touch controls on a vertical screen, and its really easy to get sucked in to game after game. Its intuitive and its addictive, which are two very good qualities for a game like this to have.(Note: Ill admit I didnt even touch the multiplayer Joy-Con mode, since neither playing with others nor with motion controls appeals to me at all.)As for the mini-games, I cant say they add much to the game, but they at least throw in some variety. Modes where you have to avoid certain pins or pull off difficult splits offer, if nothing else, opportunities to practice your game outside of the classic 10-pin game, and the duck pin version, with its smaller balls, smaller pins, and increased throws per frame will probably give you a bit of a nostalgic blast. None of them are essential, but theyre there if you want them.", "date": "February 7, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
