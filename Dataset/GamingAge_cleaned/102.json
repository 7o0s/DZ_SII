{"name": "Phantom Doctrine", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/08/phantom-doctrine-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Phantom Doctrine isnt exactly the most original game. If youve ever played X-COM or any of its variants, pretty much everything about this game will seem very, very familiar. Basically, just sub in spies for aliens, and youve got a good idea of what to expect here.That doesnt mean that Phantom Doctrine is without its charms, mind you. Its a game of 1980s Cold War spy vs. spy, and you can play as either CIA or KGB. Using that setting as a foundation, it weaves together a solid story involving (as you can imagine) espionage, double-crossing, shadowy world leaders, and everything youd hope for from a Cold War tale. It also does a good job of tying together its missions  which, as youd hope for from a spy thriller, prioritize stealth, though you can still try to go in guns blazing  with its plot.That said, the game isnt without some issues. Youll notice this right from the beginning, when youll see the game struggle to fully render the faces of your created character; even when it catches up with you updating something like glasses or a cigar, youll still see some blurry lines where the characters cheeks should be.Its not as bad within the game, but this is because a) the cutscenes here are all pre-rendered stills, which look kind of cheap, and b) were talking about a top-down, turn-based game that doesnt do anything too crazy. The camera seems a little limited, but its never unusable, merely occasionally annoying. I also sometimes found that characters didnt abide by things like walls, which kind of breaks the immersion, but it was never so bad that it broke the game.If it seems like I have more negative things to say about Phantom Doctrine, thats mainly because its such an easy game to characterize. As I said, its basically Cold War X-COM, and it pulls that off relatively well. Not so well that itll make anyone forget X-COM, but if you need something similar, this game will do in a pinch.", "date": "August 15, 2019", "grade": "B"}
