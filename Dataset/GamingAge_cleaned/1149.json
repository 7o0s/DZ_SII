After all, that one image basically captures my feelings towards it.I suppose, though, that a single image GIF review doesnt pass muster of such a high profile game. But it should! Because, much like that adorably shocked kitty, my jaw dropped the moment I started playing Ratchet & Clank, and it stayed in that position for pretty much the entire time I played it. See, Ive tried  and failed  to get into this first game in the R&C series several times. I tried it when it was remastered and re-released on PS3; I gave up because it didnt compare to the R&C Future games that Id played after it. I went back and got it on PS2, figuring that maybe it would be better if I played it as it was originally intended; still nope, only this time I found it ugly, too. And as much as I enjoyed the game as part of the remastered collection on the Vita, I cant say it gave me much insight into how it birthed a beloved franchise.All it took was a few minutes with Ratchet & Clank 2016, however, and I totally get it.Admittedly, this isnt entirely fair. After all, Ratchet & Clank on the PS4 may share the same rough outlines as its predecessors, but the way its colored in here is significantly different. Not only does the plot get fleshed out a lot more, with all kinds of new and extended scenes, theres also an extra level of meta-commentary thanks to the addition of a frame story narrated by the delightfully oblivious Captain Quark. While none of the extra plot is necessarily essential, it does make the game feel much more fleshed out (which is probably good, seeing as the movie based on the game comes out in just a few weeks, which means the gaps were getting filled in somehow anyway).Likewise, the universe here is a lot larger than it was in the original 2002 game. Not only are there a few new planets (each of which fit in pretty seamlessly), the planets that were already included in the game feel much morefull. The enemies seem to be more numerous, the buildings and structures seem more lived-in, and the various environments that make up the different worlds feel much more vibrant and varied.Obviously, thats a function of the fact that the PS4 is a heck of a lot more powerful and more capable than the PS2 was. Still, I dont think Ive ever looked at a Ratchet & Clank game and come away thinking it was one of the most beautiful games on its platform. This time out, thoughwell, just refer back to that first paragraph, and take a gander at how that cat looks. As I said, my jaw dropped when I saw how gorgeous this game was, which should give an indication of how gorgeous it is, and how favourably it compares to most other PS4 games. It just looks great.If theres one area where the game doesnt seem like a massive step forward, its in the action  which, fortuitously, is for the best, since if theres one area in which Ratchet & Clank games have never been lacking, its the action. Navigating through the many planets is slightly easier, I guess, but thats to be expected, since (in my mind, at least) the PS4 controller is a step up from those of previous consoles. Beyond that qualification, R&Cs gameplay on PS4 is exactly what weve all come to know and love about these games on PS3, and PS2, and PSP, and the PS Vita: youre battling all kinds of crazy-looking space monsters with a wide variety of hugely overpowered weapons, and its just a whole lot of fun. When youre perfected the formula, theres no sense in messing with it.", "date": "April 11, 2016", "grade": "A"}
