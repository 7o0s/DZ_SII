Its not that its a terrible game, or that its broken. Its just that, whether youre good at it or bad at it, theres not much reason to pick it up either way.Lets say youre awful at it  a category that most definitely applies to me. Gutwhales controls are kind of finicky (or, at least, thats my explanation for my complete inability to jump and shoot downwards at the same time), the gameplay is repetitive, and the whole thing gets really old really fast.But say youre good at it. Say that you instantly pick up the controls, and have no issues whatsoever with blasting your way through each level, shooting enemies, grabbing your single bullet on the rebound, and then shooting more enemies. If thats the case, thenwell, then you finish the game in under twenty minutes, since there are only three levels, and theres not much more to do once youve unlocked everything you can unlock within those twenty minutes. You could maybe swap your hat to make it a little harder, and maybe youll want to try and beat the game in under five minutes, but absent any online leaderboards or anything, whats the point?The weird thing is that Gutwhale is, in a way, the perfect Ratalaika game. Theyre known for Platinum trophies that pop way too soon, usually within about 20-30 minutes of starting a game, regardless of its length; Gutwhales Platinum doesnt pop unless you finish the game a few times overwhich happens to be less than 20-30 minutes. So, in that one specific way, it solves that problem.But like I said: whether you want a quick Platinum or not, whether youre great at it or terrible, none of that matters. Gutwhale feels like its designed to just be a deeply unsatisfying game.", "date": "August 10, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
