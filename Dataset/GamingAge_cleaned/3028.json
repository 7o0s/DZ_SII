{"name": "Vasilis", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/03/vasilis-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "One of the best Simpsons jokes of all time is from the episode where Itchy and Scratchy leave Krusty the Klowns show, and in their stead he airs Worker and Parasite, Eastern Europes favourite cat and mouse team. Its completely incomprehensible, and when the camera cuts back to Krusty, he lets out a What the hell was that?! (Video here, in case you want to watch it again.)I felt that way the entire time I was playing Vasilis. Theres some kind of story here about an old woman, the eponymous Vasilis, trying to find her husband during the darkest days of the 2014 Ukranian revolution, but Ill be honest: I barely understood what was going on most of the time. Playing as Vasilis, you wander around a surreal, war-torn dystopia, where its not uncommon to see people laying dead on the ground, and everything is constantly flashing in black and white. You occasionally interact with people and signs, which theoretically give you leads towards where your husband might be, but its all incredibly confusing.But that, I guess, might be the point? If Vasilis goal is to accurately represent what its like living in a war zone as an old lady, mission accomplished.I cant say I enjoyed it all that much, though. Nor, as I said  and this is undoubtedly related  could I understand it for the most part. Whether were talking about the dialogue or the tutorials, it seems pretty clear that something significant was lost in translation when this went from its original language (Im assuming Ukranian, though it may have been Russian) into English. For the most part, I walked around clicking on things and people, and hoping one of them would trigger whatever was supposed to come next.Again, that may well be the point. Whats more, I think/suspect/hope that Vasilis is supposed to be an artsy game, which means that a large amount of its strangeness entirely intended. But even by the standards of artsy games, Vasilis is especially strange, so unless youre fully on board with a WTF reaction, this may not be the game for you.", "date": "March 30, 2020", "grade": "B"}
