{"name": "Pokmon Sword & Shield", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/12/pokemon-sword-shield-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Pokmon Sword & Shield marks the first time a mainline Pokmon game has started life on a home console, with previous entries being focused on handheld devices like Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, DS, 3DS, and so on. While its not the first Pokmon Switch release this generation, its still a noteworthy entry for Pokmon fans and brings with it a few new bells and whistles for the long-running franchise.I wouldnt argue that Im the worlds # 1 Pokmon fan, but Ive certainly enjoyed the series across the past couple of decades. The last full release I played was Pokmon X/Y on the 3DS, so it had been a little while for me. That said, Pokmon Sword & Shield are easy enough to pick up, even for complete newcomers, so I never felt that there was any sort of significant learning curve to overcome. The core mechanic of catching, leveling up, and evolving Pokmon has mostly remained unchanged, and anyone with a basic understanding of RPG mechanics will feel right at home here.Pokmon Sword & Shield takes place in the Galar region of the Pokmon universe, a British style locale with a fairly large overworld to explore, new Pokmon to uncover, and a brand new Wild Area to keep you entertained for hours. It also features giant Pokmon, a first for the series, that become available to you via the new Dynamax feature. Giant Pokmon are basically exactly that, your standard Pokmon swelled up to a massive size, with more HP and harder hits under a three-turn limit. Its a neat idea that doesnt end up being all that important overall really, but visually its an entertaining feature. However, theres also Gigantamax Pokmon, which is essentially the same thing but with better stats, a more unique visual look, and theyre generally harder to obtain overall.Adopting a mechanic from the recent Pokmon: Lets Go series, the Pokmon you catch in the wild will now be visible on-screen before you encounter them. So no more random encounters, and it allows you to be a bit more selective when it comes to the fights you engage in. As you advance through the story, moving along the routes, caves, and towns throughout, youll catch Pokmon, battle against NPC opponents, and obtain badges by defeating Gym Leaders. All of this is pretty standard fare for Pokmon games, and again, remains pretty much identical to previous releases in the series.I will say that I found the story elements to be a little bland this time out. Most of the supporting cast feels pulled from every previous character archetype in the series, and the overall mystery that surrounds Dynamaxing Pokmon and why thats a thing in the Galar region specifically isnt all that engaging. It does make the moment to moment story beats a little boring, so if youre coming to this game for any reason other than Pokmon collecting, its something to keep in mind.Thankfully, the collecting aspect is still the biggest focus. Yes, Im aware that the Pokdex is truncated here, but theres still a hefty number of Pokmon to catch along with their ever-elusive shiny variants. There are also new 4 player raids, leading to more opportunities to obtain rare Gigantamax Pokmon with your friends. And, of course, theres all the standard trading and competitive multiplayer features youve come to expect out of the series. Its also a pretty good looking Pokmon game overall, I really dug the character animations, Pokmon designs, and the various towns available. Some of the outdoor texture stuff does get a little rough, but arguably Pokmon has never looked this good before.", "date": "December 5, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
