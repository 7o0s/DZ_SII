While that kind of thinking doesnt necessarily lead to must-play games, if nothing else it shows a willingness to experiment and try new things that should be rewarded.And now that Ive played it? I think I like the idea of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon more than I like it as a game.Im not just saying that because its so un-Bayonetta-like  though it most definitely is. While Im sure there are bigger left turns out there, going from the fast-paced, sexualized, hyper-stylish violence of the main series to a spinoff thats a cute, storybook-like game about a young girl and her demon cat solving puzzles is a pretty drastic departure. If nothing else, it means you cant exactly judge Bayonetta Origins on the same criteria that you would the mainline games since its so radically different.However, thats part of its problem. Where Bayonetta games set the bar for their brand of balletic violence, if you compare Bayonetta Origins to other games built around solving environmental puzzles with light platforming and combat elements, it doesnt stand out to nearly the same degree. The puzzles are rarely challenging, and theres not enough variety between them to keep you engaged.On top of that, the combat and the controls arent nearly as fluid  and Id combine those two things together because, in this game, theyre pretty intertwined. You control Cereza with the left stick and the aforementioned demon cat, Cheshire, with the right, and apart from the moments where Cereza is carrying Chesire, you usually have to control both at the same time. While this is mostly fine during the platforming and puzzles, when you have to fight multiple enemies it can be a little confusing to send Chesire in one direction and Cereza in another. Its not impossible, obviously, and its never so difficult that youll want to throw your Switch across the room in a rage, but given how smoothly combat works in the main series, its unfortunate that the same cant be said here, even if its a completely different style of fighting.All that said, the change isnt all bad. Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is absolutely gorgeous. Its story is told like a fairytale with turning pages and a narrator, and the visuals look like watercolours come to life. No matter what problems I may have with how the game plays out, the aesthetics are single-handedly exceptional enough that they make the whole game worthwhile. If youre going to spend a dozen-plus hours wandering around a world, then getting to enjoy visuals that are as beautiful as these make the time feel well-spent.Mind you, if youre not a fan of its art style, then Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is a much harder sell, with the gorgeous visuals covering up gameplay thats only rarely very fun. I still maintain that its great to see an established series take risks like this  and itll be interesting to see where the series evolves from here  but as of now, theres still much room for improvement.", "date": "March 24, 2023", "grade": "B"}
