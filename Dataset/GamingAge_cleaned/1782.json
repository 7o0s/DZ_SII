In pretty much every respect, its everything you could ask for in a mobile-to-handheld port. It controls well, it looks great, its addictive, and, perhaps best of all, it doesnt come to Sonys handheld with the sort of Vita Tax that other developers have added on in similar situations. Basically, Gunslugs is everything you could ask for, and possibly more.If youre expecting a But, you can keep expecting, because there isnt one forthcoming. Seriously, there are only two things wrong with it, and in both cases I use the word wrong in the absolute loosest sense imaginable.First and foremost, Gunslugs is more than a little indebted to old-school run and gun games like Metal Slug or Contra  by which I mean its exactly the same as those games. Its not the deepest game ever, but, then again, neither is its source material.Even more importantly, Gunslugs never leans on 80s nostalgia/cheese in the way that, say, the Dragon Fantasy games or Retro City Rampage did. There are some nods towards 80s action flicks scattered throughout the game, but time and again Orange Pixel resist the urge to drop a reference and call it a day. This is an honest-to-goodness fleshed-out game that just so happens to look retro, not just a pointless exercise in, Hey, remember that thing? Yeah, that was cool.The second thing wrong with Gunslugs is, quite frankly, gob-smackingly stupid: it doesnt inspire the same sort of giddy, over-the-top joy in me that I get from games like Tearaway or Hotline Miami.", "date": "March 7, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
