Alex Thomas, one of the creative minds behind The Banner Saga had been quietly working on this project for a long time, and was finally ready to show it off to the world. Killers and Thieves was created by Alex Thomas and published by Stoic, the company he co-founded, the same company that publishes The Banner Saga.Killers and Thieves is a stealth action game that also manages to be a sim. You play many roles, first and foremost being the guild master in charge of thieving and other general misconduct. Managing the funds coming in and going out of the guild is a major part of Killers and Thieves. You dont want to go broke, or else your game will come to an end. As you grow your organization and influence you will open up new areas that allow you to increase the number of shops that you have to fence your stolen goods. Every day your guild operates costs you money, so you must always ensure that the amount of money coming in is greater than the money going out.Bringing in that money is done by recruiting talent throughout the city and using them to steal for you. This is done in the form of a side view action game, with the walls of buildings transparent to the player to allow you a view of the inside. There are several mechanics at play when it comes to actually executing heists and stealing goods, but each thief is going to have a different set of talents and skills that cause them to play different in any scenario. This keeps the game fresh, and makes you stop and think before sending a particular thief on a mission. You have to find and recruit the right thief for the job and then send them on that job.When you are not actively engaged in story missions, you are able to send thieves out scouting the city for new locations and new marks, which are a vital part of making sure you keep your operation afloat. Picking which thief to send out on this missions is important, because any thief that you have sent out on a mission wont be available for a heist until they return. This makes you think carefully before making any decisions with quests. Failing a side quest however causes it to disappear completely and you are unable to regain those goods you could have gained. Side quests are such an important part of maintaining your finances it is hard not to send your best thieves out, but at the same time you dont want to be left with your B team for an actual heist.", "date": "June 1, 2017", "grade": "C+"}
