{"name": "Doodle God: Crime City", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/12/doodle-god-crime-city-review-for-nintendo-switch-xbox-one/", "text": "If you went into Doodle God: Crime City knowing nothing about the game other than what it says on its Switch store page, youd be forgiven for thinking it was some crazy, exciting game about cops and robbers. 500+ puzzles to solve! Multiple storylines! Multiple game modes! I dont know about you, but Im down for all those things.Pity, then, that its all just a very fancy way of describing just another Doodle God game, where the formula is basically the same as it has been for the better part of the last seven years: you have have pictures of a bunch of items, you combine the pictures, and, if youre attuned to the games internal logic, you unlock more items. Repeat that a bunch of times, and you have a game  in this case, repeat that 500+ times, and you have Doodle God: Crime City.Theres nothing inherently wrong with that, of course. Ive even enjoyed the odd Doodle God game myself. And, to be fair, this game probably takes the mixing and matching further than any of its predecessors, so theres certainly more Doodle God here than ever before.But that doesnt mean its significantly better. Or even kind of better. A consequence of there being so many items to combine is that theyre awfully tiny all squeezed together on the screen. There are nearly 300 elements to find in total, and even with those elements separated into 30 different groups, youll be spending a lot of time poking around the different sections, trying to remember how the game classified certain things.Youll also be spending a lot of time trying to figure out Doodle Gods odd internal logic. Some of it is certainly straightforward enough. You add crime to crime, and you get the Mafia. Add two buildings together, and you get a street. A weapon and a building lead to a gun shop. Most of them make some degree of sense.But then you get into areas where the game just seems to throw together two random things: sawdust and water create hummus, for example, while a piece of skin and a metal bar create a whip. Theres a certain degree of randomness here, which means that youll either be spending a lot of time discovering combos via trial and error, or youll have to resort to a guide.In other words, its basically just like every other Doodle God game, only with more things to combine than ever before. If thats your thing, youll be happy with whats here, but if its not, be aware youll get very, very bored, and fast.", "date": "December 9, 2019", "grade": "C"}
