{"name": "Uncharted 3: Multiplayer Free to Play Impressions", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/03/uncharted-3-multiplayer-free-to-play-impressions/", "text": "Im struggling to think of reasons for why anyone wouldnt want to give Uncharted 3s Multiplayer at least a try. I mean, its free. No matter what flaws it may have (and really, it doesnt have many), in the end, all it costs is the download time and a bit of space on your PS3s hard drive. That seems like a pretty impressive return on investment to me.Of course, an even bigger point in the games favor is probably the fact I cant think of what major flaws it does have. Im not really a fan of team-based shooters, or online multiplayer in general. This is almost entirely attributable to the fact I completely and utterly suck at them. Yet when it comes to Uncharted 3 online, I can play it for hours, get absolutely massacred (sorry about that, random online teammates) and still come away with a smile on my face. That should speak volumes for what this game mode has to offer.Because, really, what it offers is a pretty authentic Uncharted experience. True, you dont get the story aspects of the game, but you do get to recreate the gunfights and action sequences that make the game more than just a bunch of pretty cinematics. Running through the London underground, skulking around ancient ruins and ship graveyards, fighting your way through a Middle Eastern desert sandstorm; all of these things happen in the game, and all of them are available to be recreated (albeit with a few more people on the Heroes side) in multiplayer mode.The games Uncharted-ness is more than just the maps, though. Its the little asides you-as-Nathan Drake toss off every so often. Its the treasures scattered all over place. Its the music. Itswell, everything, really. (And in my specific case, its a perfect setting to get murdered repeatedly as I run around trying to shoot people without ever taking cover, just like I do when playing the game single-player campaign. Again, sorry about that, random online teammates.)", "date": "March 8, 2013", "grade": null}
