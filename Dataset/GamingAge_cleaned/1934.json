Nearly a decade ago, my colleague Dustin was lamenting the death of B quality games when writing about Risen 2  but here we are, ten years later, and that same developer, Piranha Bytes, is still around, putting out games that could charitably be described as AA experiences.To be fair, ELEX II looks a lot better than Risen did back in the PS3 days. Its not dazzling to look at, and it certainly doesnt push the Series X to its limits or anything, but just like the first ELEX didnt look too out of place on the PS4, ELEX II can pass for a modern game. Admittedly, a modern game where the characters all talk using the same facial movements and hand gestures over again, but a modern game nonetheless.Of course, in most other ways ELEX II still feels like a throwback to a decade ago, starting with the fact your character is a bald space marine named Jax. Armed with his trusty crowbar, he smashes his way through monsters named Morkons and alien invaders called Skyands, and has angry conversations with characters named Drabak and Gardok. I havent played the first ELEX, so its quite possible that first game gave all these things unexpected depths  but given how silly it all is and how seriously it takes itself, I doubt it.ELEX II also features a sizable open world thats not exactly well-planned out. While there are plenty of quests available, the distances between them vary wildly, and seldom make sense  sometimes the game will make a big deal about having to find someone whos just a few steps away, while others youll be sent across huge distances for some minor task. Whats worse, the map is pretty much useless, giving you little idea of what is where and how far apart things are. It also doesnt help that much of the game takes place in the wilderness, and its hard to tell one bit of rocky terrain from another  which means youre really relying on those useless maps.Further, while the world may be large, it doesnt feel very alive. There are people scattered here and there, but they seldom acknowledge your existence  which is doubly odd when you consider that theyre mostly just standing around in one place, waiting for you to talk to them. You can trigger short  usually very, very short  conversations with most of them, but otherwise theyre just scenery.And, of course, this wouldnt be a game from Piranha Bytes unless the character movement was all wonky. The best way to describe it is to imagine someone playing with 3D models  they look fine when theyre not doing anything, but the movement they have to move the illusion is shattered. As I mentioned above, you see this during conversations, when they go through the same animations over and over again. Likewise, when they run, they dont let things like uneven terrain or obstacles get in their way  rather, they just kind of slide onto and over rocks, chests, and other items you might find lying around, without any indication that theyre interacting with the world.Also, Billy Idol is there for some reason, and they cant stop talking about his upcoming concert on the radio.Obviously, given this is Piranha Bytes, none of this is all that unexpected  apart, I guess, from Billy Idol. After several decades of churning out games like this, it shouldnt be a surprise when ELEX II lives up to that same standard. Personally, I dont see the appeal, but if its janky, dated RPGs youre after, itll be everything youre hoping for.", "date": "April 22, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
