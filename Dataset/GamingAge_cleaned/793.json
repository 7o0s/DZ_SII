{"name": "Danger Zone", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/07/danger-zone-review-ps4-pc/", "text": "Danger Zone seems like it should be the easiest game in the world to love. Its all about vehicular destruction, made by a team of developers who worked on Burnout, the franchise that practically wrote the book on vehicular destruction. Not only that, it comes a year after the teams first game, Dangerous Golf, another game based around physics and destruction, which theoretically gave said developers an opportunity to test out their ideas and determine what works and what doesnt. Its hard to imagine a more perfect fit.Given that Dangerous Golf was pretty meh, at best, you can probably see where this is going. And if you cant, Ill make it plainly obvious right off the bat: Danger Zone sucks.Id like to say that Im being hyperbolic here, but Im not. Or, at least, if I am, its only by a matter of degrees  maybe Danger Zone only kinda sucks or mostly sucks. The bottom line is that this is not a particularly enjoyable game.It doesnt seem like its going to be this way at first. You play the tutorial, which is full of explosions and car crashes, and you instantly start thinking that this is the true successor to the Burnout franchise that some people  myself included  have been waiting years for. And then you play the first level and realize that its basically a slightly longer version of the tutorial, only with point thresholds you need to pass in order to move on to the next level.And then you play more levels and realize that theyre all pretty much rehashes of the first level, at which point, if youre like me, you start thinking that maybe all your hopes and expectations for Danger Zone were completely out of line, and that rather than getting a spiritual successor to Burnout youre actually getting a sense of what it would be like to spend hour after hour after hour after hour watching crash test dummy videos on YouTube.Sorry, Im ranting. But its justified in this case. Danger Zone should be so much better than it is, and that its not is really quite infuriating. Or, more accurately, maybe whats infuriating iswell, literally everything about this game. The fact that all the cars handle like theyre on ice, which seems like a really bad joke when you discover that quite a few of its levels demand some degree of precision if you want to meet the requisite scores for unlocking the next level. Or the fact that some of those requisite scores seem like the were grabbed from thin air, since it wasnt uncommon for me to destroy every car on the track and still find myself millions of dollars short of the bronze medal goal (to say nothing of silver or gold). Or the fact that the game doesnt include any kind of aftertouch, despite the fact that Burnout literally created that feature specifically for car crashes  after your first hit, your car sits there motionless, and youre left to hope that some of the destruction around you will ripple outwards (spoiler: it usually wont).My list of gripes with Danger Zone could go on and on. The environments manage to pull off the feat of being simultaneously ugly and sterile; my comparison to crash test dummy videos a few paragraphs up is entirely apt here, since the whole game takes place inside grimy-looking test chambers. This gives the feeling that, rather than creating a rolling mass of vehicular destruction, youre actually just running tests over and over again. Likewise, the total lack of music or ambient noise means that the game is scored by the sounds of crashing, screeching cars  the kind of thing that sounds fun, even exciting, once in awhile, but that becomes gratingly repetitive after a couple of minutes. And speaking of the cars, they suck too: youre steering a generic white automobile, and even though you crash into a variety of other test subjects (buses, tractor trailers, etc.), youre stuck with the same nondescript vehicle over, and over, and over. It wouldve been neat to see the game mix things up a little here and there, but, apparently, this game is all about making car crashes feel mundane and monotonous.If, however, Danger Zone has one sin that towers over all the others  one glaringly awful, irredeemable, unforgivable sin  its this: the crashes arent even that fun. Sure, theyre kind of loud, and they occasionally generate some fun sparks and fires, but while the promise of something big is always just around the corner, it never materializes. With all these cars bouncing around and all these extra loads being carried by flat-beds and all the flames everywhere, youd think that eye-popping explosions would be on the menu at some point, but youd be wrong on that count. Their absence encapsulates everything wrong with Danger Zone, in that it means that the game cant even deliver on the one thing  literally, the one and only thing  that youd want it to deliver on.", "date": "July 14, 2017", "grade": "D+"}
