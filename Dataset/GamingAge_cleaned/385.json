{"name": "Tetras Escape", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/10/tetras-escape-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "If youre a trophy hunter, the appeal of Tetras Escape is obvious: you can get a Platinum trophy in less than an hour, and you can do so for about $5. All in all, not a bad deal. But what about if you dont care for trophies? Does the game offer quite the same value? Maybe, maybe not  your answer here will all depend on what you think of games you can beat easily in one sitting.Personally, Im all in favour of them. As someone who never has enough time to sink into a lengthy game, its kind of nice to play Tetras Escape. The mechanics are simple, theres no convoluted plot to remember, and, as I said, you can beat the whole thing in less than an hour. It may not be a difficult thing to achieve, but that doesnt lessen the sense of accomplishment.To be sure, however, if you want more out of a game, then Tetras Escape may not be as enticing. Theres not a tonne of content, for starters: there are 8 worlds here, with 8 levels in each, but all of them can be beaten in a couple of minutes at most. Likewise, theres zero plot: as the title implies, youre helping little blocks  most of which transform into Tetris-like tetrominoes  reach the end of a level, and you only need one to get to the end in order to free all of them. And, to be completely honest, the games graphics leave a little to be desired, seeing, again, that the characters are all blocks, and theyre inhabiting a mostly featureless 2.5D world.But seeing as Tetras Escape isnt promising all that much, I find it hard to get that worked up about any of its drawbacks. It doesnt ask much of players  in terms of time, money, or brain power  and in return, it gives you an hour of pleasantness. It wont be anybodys Game of the Year or anything, but its certainly enjoyable enough to pass the time while youre playing it.", "date": "October 12, 2018", "grade": "B"}
