{"name": "Oddworld: New n Tasty!", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/08/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review-ps4/", "text": "The more I play of Oddworld: New n Tasty, the more I get the sense that its a whole lot better if youre looking at it through nostalgia goggles. After all, I missed the original Oddworld: Abes Oddysee (I was too busy being a Nintendo-only gamer at the time), which means Im going into this recrafted version without any prior experience with the game. Andwell, I cant say Im a huge fan of it.Before I say anything else, I should emphasize that I dont think its a bad game. Were not talking about some RBI Baseball-level atrocity, wherein the corpse of a once-great game has been revived just to be desecrated. No, much like the last few Oddworld remasters, New n Tasty was developed by Just Add Water and published by series creators Oddworld Inhabitants, which means that it was created every bit as lovingly as youd hope. This is most apparent in its looks, which are utterly fantastic; if you didnt know that it was a recreated game from 20 years ago, you wouldnt be able to guess.Unfortunately, the same level of care doesnt seem to have been put into the controls. Now, some of this may just be my bitterness talking. Oddworld: New n Tasty is mind-bogglingly hard, even on the easiest difficulty settings, and it challenges you right from the get-go. Youll die frequently and in incredibly gory ways if youre not playing with the utmost care, and Ill freely admit that my style of playing games tends to be a little reckless (to put it mildly).Having said that, however, the controls dont seem to do you any favours. The formerly-titular Abe is perhaps a little too sensitive, prone to running at full speed into things or off ledges the moment you even nudge a thumbstick  which, obviously, is a pretty big deal in a game that relies heavily on stealth and finesse. Again, Ill admit my lacklustre abilities have at least a little to do with my ineptitude, but at the same time, for such a demanding game, it doesnt seem like much to demand a little help in return.Then again, maybe thats intentional. Speaking of both the gory deaths and the love that Oddworld/Just Add Water have put into the game, nowhere is this clearer than in the death animations. I lost track of the number of times my head went flying off and my guts were splattered everywhere, but I always noted that said head and guts were way, way more detailed than anything Ive seen in most other games. (I should add that this level of detail is also found in the environments and other characters  its just most noticeable when your on-screen character is being ripped apart by spinning blades.)", "date": "August 1, 2014", "grade": "B"}
