{"name": "Saints Row: Gat Out Of Hell", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/01/saints-row-iv-gat-hell-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "I always felt a little puzzled last year any time I read or heard people declaring games like Destiny or Watch Dogs to be the worst of the year. After all, I played both, and even if I didnt love either of them, I still know that I played all kinds of games that were far, far worse.Now that Ive played Saints Row IV: Gat Out of Hell, however, I kind of get where those people were coming from. Am I going to play objectively worse games this year? Undoubtedly. Am I going to play games that leave me feeling more enraged? Barring Arkham Knight, Hotline Miami 2 or Uncharted 4 being complete and utter catastrophes, I have a hard time seeing it.Of course, I suspect that my reason for hating Gat Out of Hell is pretty much the exact opposite of why some people hated Destiny or Watch Dogs so. As I understand it, people were disappointed because, while technically sound (for the most part), the ideas in those games were kind of bland. In Gat Out of Hells case, by contrast, ideas arent the issue. Like the last few games in the series, Gat Out of Hell is bursting with creativity. Its got talking guns, its got Shakespeare and Vlad the Impaler (among others) as your demonic allies, its got you running around Hell with the same kind of superpowers you had in Saints Row. Heck (or, I guess, Hell), it even has a musical number that a) wouldnt be out of place in a Disney movie (albeit some kind of weird, R-rated Disney movie) and b) suggests that the Bollywood number that was allegedly going to be the finale of Saints Row IV wouldve been amazing.No, the issue with Gat Out of Hell is that its kind of a buggy mess. Enemies floating in mid-air  and not just the winged demons, but bad guys who arent supposed to be able to fly, too. Guns that are impossible to pick up. Things  demons, damned souls, vehicles  walking through walls. Pre-rendered killing animations where youre several feet away from the bad guys being killed  which is to say, Johnny Gat/Kinzie are doing their thing, the kill-ees are doing theirs, but the two dont exactly match up. Vehicles that dont do what theyre supposed to do  by which I mean sometimes theyll suddenly veer across the screen for no reason whatsoever, while others theyll just get stuck, and you have to wait for the game to realize you are, in fact, still holding down that accelerator button.Even the ragdoll physics dont totally work right. The ragdoll physics! There were numerous times when I was playing Gat Out Of Hell where Id be in an exploding vehicle, or Id be crushed by an exploding vehicle, or Id be getting shot at from all sides, but rather than flopping about hilariously, Id just sort of slide, and then suddenly be back on my feet again.And while Im in a complaining mood, I have to say that the games portrayal of Hell kind of sucks. Its got fire and brimstone everywhere, and it has a couple of really cool, demonic-looking areas. But for the most part, Gat Out Of Hells Hell is just a dank, drab, grey place. Generally, its hard to distinguish one area from another, because they all look so similar. For a series thats been built on an outlandish, gaudy world, youd think that Hell of all places could really inspire Saints Rows designers to new artistic heights, butnope.What really pisses me off about it all is that Gat Out Of Hell couldve been awesome. Its no crappy cash-in, featuring a warmed-over plot or a world indistinguishable from the original game. This is a fully fleshed-out game, with all the ideas and inventiveness that youd expect from a Saints Row game. All that it had to do, technically-speaking, was live up to the standards set by Saints Row the Third and Saints Row IV.", "date": "January 19, 2015", "grade": "C-"}
