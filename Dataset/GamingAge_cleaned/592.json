{"name": "OK K.O.! Lets Play Heroes", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/02/ok-k-o-lets-play-heroes-review-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "I suspect that in order to get the most out of OK K.O.! Lets Play Heroes, you need to be a fan  or at least aware  of the Cartoon Network series on which the game is based. Or, at least, thats my hope, because after playing it for awhile, I honestly have no idea who else this game might be for.Beat-em-up fans? Probably not, since you have to wade through a whole bunch of talking and wandering around in order to get to the brawling (and once you get to it, its pretty mediocre). People who are looking for a strong story in their games? No again, since the game is more comprised of short quests and plot developments that, presumably, make a lot more sense if youre familiar with the show. Gamers who just really like licensed games in general? Maybe, though Im not sure that such undiscerning people exist.In any case, in OK K.O.! Lets Play Heroes, youre playing as the titular K.O., and the game essentially consists of you walking around a strip mall, interacting with other characters from the show and, occasionally, stumbling across robots that you need to beat up. These interactions probably make a lot of sense if you know the characters and what makes them funny. If you dont  and I absolutely dont  then itll mostly seem like a bunch of generic, one-dimensional cartoon characters saying catchphrases to each other.As for the fights themselves, theyre fine. The controls are fairly basic, and the power-ups you earn from collecting cards throw in a bit of a twist. Its competently done, but its hard to say its anything more than that.Which brings us back to where we were when we started this review. If youre a fan of OK K.O.! Lets Play Heroes and youre eager to experience it in another medium, then you may want to check it out. If youre not, look elsewhere, because this is a strictly fans-only game.", "date": "February 22, 2018", "grade": "C-"}
