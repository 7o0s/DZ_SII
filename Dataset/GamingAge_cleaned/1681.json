Got it? Good.The Last of Us Remastered is the same brutal, heart wrenching and exhausting tale of Joel and Ellie attempting to survive in a post-pandemic world  its just a whole lot prettier (assuming you can label crumbling civilization, infected humans and extreme violence as such). Its still an incredible experience no matter which generations platform its played on, though if you have a PS4 and never owned a PS3 and/or a copy of the game, theres really no excuse now. After all, theres a reason why it took home 200+ awards.With the PS3 original only a little over a year old, The Last of Us should still be relatively fresh to those who played it when it launched last summer. I personally had no issues with the visuals, gameplay or performance of the PS3 version, but of course after playing through the game on the PS4, its pretty damn clear that Naughty Dogs vision was held back somewhat by the hardware. Even if you were totally content with what they squeezed out of Sonys last gen hardware, experiencing the game at 1080p and a nearly flawless 60fps framerate is eye opening. The enhanced texture resolution, shadows and lighting are certainly worthwhile upgrades, but its the framerate (which has essentially doubled) that makes the most dramatic visual difference. The increased fluidity is really a change that youll have to sit down and play, and see with your own eyes, to fully appreciate. Ill be honest though, the cut-scenes do look weird for the first 30 seconds or so, but you do get used to it. The studio has provided an option to lock down the game at 30fps which provides for a more PS3-like cinematic (hah) experience and slightly improved shadows, but once you get used to playing the game at 60, its hard to go back.Since this is a remaster and not a remake, it wasnt expected that the entire game would receive a total overhaul  especially in the timeframe that they have done so. You can pretty obviously see the games PS3 roots in terms of environmental complexity, and most of that has not changed. The textures, shading and effects have benefitted the most, but the poly counts on the locations and objects have not been noticeably altered. The Last of Us Remastered does utilize the more detailed cut-scene character models, in-game, and they indeed look amazing. Naughty Dogs stunning motion-captured character animation is very much on display as you play the game, and youll undoubtedly notice little details and facial expressions that were missed before.The enhancements, beyond providing for a smoother gameplay experience, actually make the game a bit less challenging (in a good way)  especially when playing on Survivor/Grounded difficulty modes. Thanks to the increased fidelity, I found myself able to visually pick out threats from a much further distance and plan my survival strategy accordingly. Discounting the fact that Ive played through it all before, I had a much easier time maintaining stealth through an area infested with clickers or being patrolled, for example. Oh, and do yourself a favor and turn off the listen mode; the game takes on a whole other dimension when you need to rely on your own eyes and ears. Speaking of audio, it may just be the placebo effect, but Im pretty sure the quality of the music, sound effects and voice samples have been improved. Spatial awareness in the game is quite important, so the ability to precisely define your surround sound speaker locations in the games audio options was a nice touch.If youve never had the pleasure/pain of playing through the original, The Last of Us Remastered all by itself would be worth the $50. The fact that its bundled with the Left Behind single player DLC, several new multiplayer maps and additional bonus content such as in-game commentary and photo mode, most certainly hits the sweet spot even for those whove dumped many hours into the PS3 version. The multiplayer experience is a unique and addictive one, and with many tweaks and balances since the PS3 version launched, it still holds up extremely well on the PS4.", "date": "July 29, 2014", "grade": "A+"}
