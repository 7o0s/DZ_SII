{"name": "The Legend of Dark Witch", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/06/legend-dark-witch-review-ps-vita/", "text": "The Legend of Dark Witch features a trophy for completing the game in 45 minutes or less. This should tell you a lot about the game  specifically, that when you play the game on the easiest difficulty level, youll quickly find that its sufficiently lacking in content and features simple enough mechanics that beating everything in under an hour is relatively simple.That isnt the whole story, of course. It elides the fact that the games final level is exponentially more difficult than everything thats come before it. Whereas you can beat each of the first six levels just by holding down the shoot button and an occasional well-timed jump, the final level is harder by several orders of magnitude. Suddenly the game demands that you execute perfectly-timed jumps, shoot significantly more intelligent enemies, and generally play in a way that isnt required of you at any point until then.In this respect, I guess, the game is just giving easy players a taste of whats in store for them on other difficulty levels. See, the other thing that the 45-minute trophy doesnt tell you is that The Legend of Dark Witch owes a pretty major debt to Mega Man. Its not nearly as good as Mega Man, of course, but you dont have to look too closely to see how the two games have quite a bit of common DNA.Thats not the only place The Legend of Dark Witch borrows/steals from either. While the games general aesthetic is generic Japanese anime every so often youll come across characters that look like they stepped out of a Kirby game. It doesnt mean much in the big scheme of things, but every time they show up on screen, it makes for a jarring contrast.", "date": "June 20, 2017", "grade": "C-"}
