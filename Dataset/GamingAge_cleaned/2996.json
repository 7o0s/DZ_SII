I mean, its a PS Vita exclusive, more than 8 years after the system came out (and, Ill grudgingly note, nearly as many years as most people gave up on the Vita). As someone who is still unhealthily obsessed with still loves and plays the Vita constantly  last year was the first year since 2012 it wasnt my most-played console, and even then it was a close second to the Switch  Im certainly not going to say no to a game that only Vita owners can play.The thing iswell, its just not very good. It was designed exclusively for the Vita, but it plays as if it was designed by someone whod never actually held a Vita. Its a shmup, except you move with the right stick, and you shoot with the D-pad  which, obviously, is immediately above the right stick. Maybe Ive been gaming wrong all these years, but its absurdly difficult to the point of impossible to move your character around while also shooting at your opponent. Eventually I realized that if I just camped in one spot on the screen and spammed the shooting button, it was possible to play without getting a severe cramp in my hands, but thats hardly a fun way to play. (You could also try holding the Vita vertically, but I quickly discovered I was really bad at playing that way).Of course, that speaks to the games other major flaw, which is that you can do pretty much everything Battle Rockets has to offer by camping in one spot and spamming the shoot button. There are eight single-player modes, and apart from a couple of very easy mazes, you can beat them all by not moving. I mean, my hand felt better after I realized I could coast to a platinum with a minimum of effort, but that hardly speaks well of the game. There are also three multiplayer modes, which require a little more dexterity  and, also, holding the Vita vertically between you and a friend  but none of them have much in the way of replay value.Id love to be able to say that theres something here that makes the game worthwhile, but the best that can be said about the graphics is that they look like they came from a somewhat unskilled chibi anime. Theyre not offensively bad or anything, but I think youd probably get higher production values from mobile games a decade ago.Really, the only good thing I can say about Battle Rockets is that it must be a labour of love, because its only on the Vita. Personally, as someone who has played the Vita for far more hours than most people, I feel like thats enough to make the game worthwhile, but for anyone who isnt a diehard Vita completionist, Battle Rockets is more an oddity worth noting than something worth playing.", "date": "April 29, 2020", "grade": "C"}
