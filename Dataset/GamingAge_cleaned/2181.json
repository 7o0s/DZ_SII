{"name": "The Walking Dead: Episode 5  No Time Left", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/11/the-walking-dead-episode-5-no-time-left-review-for-xbox-360-ps3-pc/", "text": "Its sort of weird to think that Episode 5 of Telltales The Walking Dead was pretty much my most anticipated release of the year, especially considering that it was dropping around the same time as Nintendos new console, and in a year that saw numbered sequels to titles like Halo, and a slew of other great releases. But I cannot think of a single game that has had this sort of grip on me in quite some time, and after the fantastic cliffhanger of Episode 4, I needed to see this storyline resolved ASAP.Again, as Ive mentioned in my previous reviews for the past episodes, Ill avoid spoiler talk here. You really need to go into the series as cold as possible when it comes to detailed information. So Ill do my best to talk around the important bits, as I try to explain why this is damn near the perfect end to a really stellar run of episodic content from Telltale, and certainly the best thing theyve ever had their name attached to. Despite how much you might have enjoyed previous releases, like Back to the Future, Monkey Island, and so on, theres no doubt in my mind that this is, hands down, the best Telltale adventure to date. And the final episode just cements that for me.The last episode saw our group in dire straits, with the ragtag bunch of survivors, a few people short at this point, faced with certain doom on a number of angles. The relationship between Lee and Clementine, as a surrogate father figure and daughter, has essentially been pushed to the brink. That situation is definitely resolved with Episode 5, thankfully, but the way its resolved is bound to evoke a whole lot of emotion from you. Its rare that a game can affect me the same way film does emotionally, which is sort of shame considering how much I love gaming, but Episode 5 of The Walking Dead doesnt drop the ball here. Its an emotional end to a series that has forced me to make a lot of hard choices, certain ones that I do wish I could do over (and of course could through a second playthrough), and I love the bit in this episode that throws a number of decisions in my face.This is a short episode, but the time spent is well utilized. Its light on action bits, but theres a sequence here thats almost cathartic for players, allowing you to sort of abandon reason and throw caution to the wind in a way that the series hasnt allowed you to do before. Its a great lead-in to the final conflict of the game, which is handled almost exclusively through dialogue, and really challenges the player to look back at how theyve handled events in the game, and sort of forces you to come to grips with those decisions. Its an interesting way of making you come to terms with the decisions made up to this point, and is far more effective than just capping the game off with a final boss or something silly, which Im sure most folks assumed this game wasnt going to do.But past that last conflict, theres a very touching, heart wrenching finale that I would be an absolute jerk to ruin for you here. But as I mentioned earlier, I think everyone thats as invested in the series as I am to this point will find themselves affected in some manner by the end of this episode. And while this certainly caps off the central storyline, theres enough of a hook at the end of the credits that certainly drives your anticipation for another season up, and will make the wait that much harder to get through.", "date": "November 27, 2012", "grade": "A"}
