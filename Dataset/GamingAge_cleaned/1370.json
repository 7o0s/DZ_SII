{"name": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-review-for-ps4/", "text": "The very first thing you see in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a disclaimer: This game is a narrative experience which does not hold your hand.It doesnt take long for the game to put those words into action. Moments later, you find yourself emerging from a dark train tunnel in the middle of the woods. Theres no guidance as to where you should go next, nor any indication of what you can or are supposed to do. Youre just there, trying to solve a mystery, and its up to you to decide where to go next.In other words, if youre the kind of person who wants a little bit of direction in your games, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter probably isnt for you. That cold open sets the tone for the entire game, since youll be expected to piece everything together on your own, with no help or direction at any point in time. Theres the odd button prompt, of course, but those are so few and far between that they feel like the barest nod the games developers could possibly make towards the fact that they have, in fact, created an interactive experience rather than a really pretty animated movie.Because of that, the only way to figure out what youre doing is to move slowly and deliberately, keeping your eyes open for anything in the way of clues. Theres no rushing here; The Astronauts really seem to want you to experience The Vanishing of Ethan Carter as an immersive narrative rather than as a bunch of puzzles to be solved.Its not hard to see why they wanted people to inhabit the games world, though: its incredibly gorgeous. The first time my wife saw me playing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, she stopped what she was doing just to comment on the fact she couldnt believe a video game looked so lifelike. Admittedly, the game is probably helped immeasurably in this respect by the fact it seldom shows people. Its set in an abandoned village in rural Pennsylvania, which means that all it has to do is show environments; when it does pause to advance the narrative via flashback, theres a definite uncanny valley thing going on.", "date": "August 10, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
