{"name": "The Walking Dead: A New Frontier From the Gallows", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/05/walking-dead-new-frontier-gallows-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "The Walking Dead Season 3 concludes this week with the release of the fifth episode, From the Gallows. Considering the events at the end of episode four, youd expect this final episode to kick off with a bang, but instead we get one last look at Javier and his brother David in the pre-zombie apocalypse. Its one last chance to see their unique brand of sibling rivalry, and is certainly meant to influence a couple of decisions over the next hour or so.That said, brief past interlude aside, Javiers world is in pretty bad shape after the end of the last episode. Forced to make an awful life or death decision, which also goes awry, Javier, Kate, and everyone else is stuck trying to survive and pick up the pieces of Richmond. There are a few solid character moments in-between the action, one Kenny-esque death in my opinion (meaning you dont see a body), and some definitive resolution to Javiers story at the end of it all.[youtube_sc url=https://youtu.be/8g65ZlBcXEQ]But how about Clementine? This episode honestly feels a little too low key as far as her involvement goes. I was honestly a bit surprised by how little she seems to contribute here, outside of the tail end of From the Gallows. Obviously Im not going to lay down any major spoilers here, but this season has absolutely been about Javier, and maybe a little bit about Clementine, and that doesnt change much here. Im OK with that, because I did like the introduction of fresh blood and a new perspective for a change, but if youre looking for Clementines moment to shine, you might be a bit disappointed.", "date": "May 30, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
