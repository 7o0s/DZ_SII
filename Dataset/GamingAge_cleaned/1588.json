{"name": "Lords of the Fallen", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/11/lords-fallen-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "Im generally not a fan of really hard games. Titles like Dark Souls/Demon Souls, Spelunky, 1001 Spikes? No matter how beloved they may be by lots of people who are far more knowledgeable (and skilled, obviously) than I, Ive never been able to get into them for the simple reason that theyre just too difficult. Its totally a matter of preference, of course, but if you give me the choice between tough-as-nails anything or the chance to indulge in a crazy power fantasy (a la God of War), Ill take the god-like power every time.I say all this as preamble to writing about Lords of the Fallen because more than a few people have noted the new games similarity to Dark/Demon Souls. It, too, has a medieval setting, and it also features knights battling against all kinds of cursed creatures. And, most importantly, its hard  not DS-level hard by any stretch, but it still presents players with a bit of a challenge.Based on my first paragraph, you might think I dont like Lords of the Fallen. And while thats correct Im not really a fan of it  my reasons for disliking it actually have nothing to do with how hard it is. It certainly presents a challenge, but never to an impossible degree; provided you approach things with bit of patience, youll find that even the toughest enemies are eventually beatable. Or, to put it another way, you never get the sense that the game is actively trying to kill you at every turn.So whats the issue then? Basically, that Lords of the Fallen just isnt very good. Admittedly, some of this just comes down to my own personal game design preferences not meshing with what the developers wanted to do. Deck13 Interactive/CI Games clearly wanted to give every action a sense of weight, and to that end they made sure that pretty much everything you do  every swing of your weapon, every dodge out of the way, every enemy block, even every swig of health juice  is slow and deliberate, just as it would be if you really were an axe-swinging knight dressed in a full suit of armor.The thing isthats just not fun. Again, I think I understand what they were going for, but in practice it just feels slow and clunky. Even more than that, it feels like its at cross-purposes of forcing players to act deliberately and cautiously. Like, whats the point of making players wait to pick their spots and engage enemies if the battles just end up being slugfests anyway? You can dodge and block all you want, but you move so slowly and it takes so much out of you youre better off just whacking away at the demons and hoping your energy fills faster than theirs. Of course, if/when you do take that approach, then youd better hope that your character can drink down that health mixture quickly  I actually died one time because my character swallowed his medicine (or whatever you want to call it) too slowly.Of course, if you really want annoying and clunky, nothing quite matches the camera on those fronts. I honestly cant remember the last time I felt like I was fighting so hard to get a good view of the action. At first I thought it was just because of constraints associated with being inside an enclosed space, but even after things opened up a little, I still found myself fighting against a camera that didnt want to stay in a good position.As for the rest of Lords of the Fallen, theres nothing here you havent seen before. No matter how cool the Wikipedia plot synopsis may make the game sound, the reality is youre still just some scruffy, muscle-bound knight fighting demons. You still loot randomly placed crates for coins and other goodies. You still fight enemies that spawn regularly in the same places, to the point that you can make a run through a dungeon killing everything in your way, and then go back to the beginning and do it all over again in exactly the same order. Creative thinking isnt exactly the games strong suit.", "date": "November 10, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
