{"name": "Deadpool", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/deadpool-review-for-ps3-xbox-360-pc/", "text": "Deadpool is one of those Marvel Comics characters you either love or hate. His appearance in various comic series like X-Men and X-Force, or even his own series, has garnered a legion of fans as well as a legion of haters. HIs appearance in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 sparked the beginning of an outcry for good old Wade Wilson to get his own game. Fans love his level of humor mixed with the outrageous violence, while haters just love to see him get dismembered. Now, thanks to High Moon Studios and Activision, Deadpool finally has a Video Game to call his own, but is it any good? Read on.Just like the Deadpool comics, this game not only breaks the 4th wall, it smashes it with a hammer and then dances on the rubble! Right from the beginning you are thrust into a wacky world where your first mission is to screw around in Deadpools apartment. Messing around with everything gets you used to the controls and the overall silliness you are about to experience.It seems that Wade set up a deal with High Moon Studios to make a video game starring him, but when they back out of the deal Deadpool sends them an offer they cant refuse (with a bunch of explosives and time bombs). After his offer, High Moon is thrilled to work with Deadpool and sends over the script to his game.From here, youre thrown into a wacky story where DP is hired to capture a crime boss, only to have villains from the Marvel Universe, Arclight and Vertigo, interrupt and capture the guy DP was supposed to grab. At this point youre introduced to Deadpools world of Mutants, mayhem and the occasional budget cut, necessary to complete his contract and get paid. I could go on with what happens in the story, but I dont want to ruin anything here. Ive actually already said too much, so lets just say the story will keep you entertained all the way through.However, the actual gameplay is a whole different bag. Youll be spending all of your time moving Deadpool through linear mazes and fighting a room full of enemies. After about the 15th or 16th fight, things start to get stale. Thankfully, the fighting is broken up with the occasional puzzle that is somewhat easy to solve. There are some short shooting sequences thrown in to spice things up, but these are few and far between. Mix these elements in with the occasional boss battle, and youve got an experience thats pretty mediocre. Even sneaking up on a bad guy and performing a silent kill is fun to watch the first few times, but after you do it enough, the sequences that follow get tired and you tend to just run into a room guns a blazing just to get through the fight. But thanks to the awesome writing and the overall wackiness of the world of Deadpool, the somewhat stale gameplay will seem like a mild issue, since theres something funny or entertaining around almost every corner.Controlling Deadpool can be a bit of a chore, since youll spend a large amount of time fighting the camera and the awkward targeting system. I took unnecessary damage and died many times, thanks to the camera getting stuck in a wall or not being able to line up a shot in time to take out a faraway enemy. Speaking of the enemies, some youll encounter are just plain difficult and annoying to face. Like the group of enemies who are protected by Mister Sinisters shield, or 2 giant mutant monsters that just trap you in a corner and wail on you, among other annoying groups. Its these instances that even the comedic writing cannot save, and unfortunately they are plentiful, which can lead to a rage quit.Graphics in Deadpool are great. Each environment is rendered smoothly and mesh with the setting well. Occasionally you may notice a lazy texture, or something that doesnt look quite right, but not only are these areas few and far between, but Deadpool and the voices in his head will point them out. So, you never really know if any glitch or bad texture you find wasnt put there on purpose. Theres even a sequence that is reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda, and a joke where an entire section of the level was affected by budget cuts and you need to download a quick patch to fix it.", "date": "July 2, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
