Last time we heard from the studio, they had created Its Spring Again, an odd little game based on an educational puppet show that taught 2- and 3-year-olds the seasons.This time out, One Eyed Kutkh is geared towards an older demographicbut only barely. The best way to think of it is as My First Point & Click Adventure. Its incredibly short, with a runtime that goes for about 15-20 minutes  and that number is inflated by the slow speed at which every character moves. The puzzles arent exactly challenging either, and mostly consist of moving your character from Point A to Point B, and interacting with whatever objects you happen to come across. Similarly, the story  about an alien crash-landing on a planet and having to collect pieces of his ship  seems like the sort of thing that youd find in a childrens book, even if its actually based on Russian folk tales.Its the visual aesthetic, though, that really makes the game seem like its aimed at younger players. The colours are generally pleasant and bright, and the characters are all happy and friendly. Its not going to wow you with its graphics or anything, but its still easy to see how One Eyed Kutkh would be appealing to people who dont usually play video games.On the one hand, thats really just another way of saying that if youre looking for a challenge or something that will wow you, One Eyed Kutkh probably isnt it. But if youre an optimist looking for the good news, or if youre looking for a way to hook someone just starting out with games, there are certainly worse ways to do it than with this one.", "date": "April 24, 2018", "grade": "B"}
