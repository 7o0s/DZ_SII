{"name": "Conception II: Children of the Seven Stars", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/05/conception-ii-children-seven-stars-review-ps-vita/", "text": "On some level, Conception II isnt that weird. Its a dungeon-crawling RPG with turn-based combat. You fight monsters with a party, and like most games of with party- and turn-based fights, you need to optimize your teams structure. On top of that, youre playing as a student, and a key part of the game is navigating your high schools social scene. In other words, if you look at it in just the right light, its kind of Persona-y.If you look at it in any other way, however, its pretty freaking weird. See, youre not just trying to navigate your high schools social scene, youre trying to build up your relationships with your female classmates so you can get with them. Like, in the pants, all sexy-like. Theres even a specific term for it: classmating. And its not just some side aspect of the game, either: the babies  sorry, the Star Children  that result from your getting it on fight monsters alongside you. Youre playing as someone whos quite literally Gods Gift (thats seriously what your characters rank is), and your ability to make babies is so amazing, its your duty to classmate as often as possible. And when you classmate, your kinda-nude bodies swirl around on the screen, the only thing keeping the game from going above an M rating being that neither the pink girl or the blue boy display any genitals. Once its all over, your female partner looks all flushed and out of breath, and she briefly talks about how wonderful it was.Oh, and just to make you feel little bit creepier for playing, all characters in this game  or, at least, all the characters making babies  are between 16 and 18 years of age.In other words, Conception II isnt a game for the prudish or the easily offended. To its credit, though, it doesnt try and shy away from its sleaziness. Right in the games first scene, you have an elderly priest mentioning how busty all the new female students seem to be. Girls have conversations about their breasts. Every time a female classmate comes onscreen during a dialogue, her chest always jiggles. And, of course, theres all that stuff I mentioned just a few sentences ago. There are storylines and plots and character development and whatnot, but at its core, Conception II is exactly what it looks like: a high school sim where you make babies and fight through monster-infested dungeons.Of course, critics might say that the game prioritizes things in that order  that the dungeon-crawling is secondary to the baby-making. And theres probably some validity to that criticism, too. The monsters vary a little, particularly when it comes to the bosses, but to get to those bosses you mostly fight your way through the same monsters over and over again. Theres something novel about seeing babies fighting demon horses and flying imps and such, but at the same time, it can feel a little heavy on the grinding after youve been doing it awhile.", "date": "May 1, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
