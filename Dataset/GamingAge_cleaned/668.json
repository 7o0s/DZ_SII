I feel like this is worth mentioning, since the game not only proudly notes that it brings together suits and characters from past Mobile Suit Gundam games, its whole plot is about fixing a tear in the series canonical history and restoring it to the way things should be. Based on that, I have to imagine that someone with better knowledge of the series lore would have a much better appreciation for everything that happens in this game.Whereas for mewell, I was just attracted by the promise of giant fighting robots leveling cities around them. How could that possibly miss?Turns out, quite easily  though not because I felt like the plot was way over my head or anything. I mean, SD Gundam Battle Alliance is full of endless expository dialogue, so I assume those things would have been more enjoyable if I knew who the characters were, but theres no way a lack of familiarity made it harder for me to enjoy the game. As I said, its a game about giant fighting robots: even if you dont know the background, its not that hard to fill in the blanks. Having said that, there are a lot of very lengthy explanations as to how everything works that generally felt like they were unnecessarily padded. Given that the controls arent hugely complex, it frequently felt like the game was holding your hand to explain things that were generally pretty obvious.In any case, its that simplicity thats SD Gundam Battle Alliances bigger problem. Simply put, the fighting just isnt that interesting. You have a couple of different melee and ranged attacks, but you just do them over and over again until youve wiped out the enemies, ending with a big boss fight, and it never really mixes it up.Whats more, everything here feels oddly weightless. You can fire bombs and rockets at everything around you, you can crush city blocks beneath your metal feet, you can get pummeled by rampaging enemies: whatever happens, you never feel like youre watching metal behemoths battle it out. Compared with, say, an EDF game, where every time you take out a building or topple a giant metal enemy, it feels like an event, and you can see why this feels so underwhelming.Because really, thats the bigger issue here. Whether youre intimately familiar with Mobile Suit Gundam or a total newcomer, the basic gist of the game should be enough to suck you in and keep you riveted. That its not shows just how forgettable this gameplay is  and forgettable is never a word that should apply to robots trying to blow each other up.", "date": "September 23, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
