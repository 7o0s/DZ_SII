{"name": "Word Forward", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/12/word-forward-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Word Forward is hard.As someone who has been addicted to word games pretty much my entire life, thats not a statement I make lightly, nor is it one that Im eager to make  after all, what good is a lifetime of Scrabble and other word games if you admit a game bests you? But the more I play Word Forward, the more that becomes my unavoidable conclusion.Of course, a big part of why I find it so hard is because Word Forward isnt really a word game, so much as its a strategy game that just happens to feature letters and words.Im not just splitting hairs here, either. Typically word games reward big vocabularies and chaining together as many letters as possible to rack up points. If you do that in Word Forward, youll fail miserably.Rather, the goal here is to clear 55 grids, connecting letters that touch each other. While that may sound sort of like Boggle, you quickly discover that creating long words really just hurts you  you may clear out a huge chunk of letters, but then youre left with some random letter sitting all by its lonesome. There are a few extra tools in each puzzle  a letter swapper here, a bomb there  that help you out a little, but the other think you quickly discover are that those are precious, and running through them too quickly doesnt necessarily help you.In other words (pun not intended), Word Forward is kind of lousy if youre in the mood for a straight-up word game, but probably amazing if its a challenging puzzle game youre after. Its built around a concept thats really easy to grasp but ridiculously hard to master, and if you want something you can sink dozens of hours into (or even just a couple of minutes at a time, many, many times), this is what youre looking for.", "date": "December 23, 2021", "grade": "B"}
