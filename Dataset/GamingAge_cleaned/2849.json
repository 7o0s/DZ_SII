{"name": "Tamiku", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/10/tamiku-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Last time we heard from developers Joysan, they were ripping off Space Invaders. Now theyre back with Tamiku, and theyre ripping offsomething.The thing is, I cant quite put my finger on what. Its a little like Bubble Bobble, and a little like Pac-Man, and maybe even a little like Dig Dug, but its different enough that it cant exactly be called a clone. Where Joysans last game was so much like Space Invaders it couldnt be ignored, Tamiku merely feels like a clone without actually being one.Part of the reason Im having trouble figuring out what Tamiku reminds me of most is that its an incredibly short game, so its not around long enough to leave much of an impression. The levels all take place on a single screen, and involve the titular hero jumping up and down from row to row popping balloons and avoiding enemies. On top of that, there are only 16 levels in total, and each of them take only a few minutes each at most (and if you dont have the attention span for even that, the Platinum pops after only 10 levels).Admittedly, during the half hour or so it should take you to finish Tamiku, youll likely enjoy yourself. Its a pretty simple concept  which, again, feels like its borrowed from somewhere else  and youll get the hang of it in no time. As you can tell from the list of influences above, its also highly reminiscent of old arcade games, to the point that I would totally have believed it was a port of a game from 35 years ago.But when a) you can see everything a game has to offer in 30 minutes, and b) youre left feeling like youve played this exact game somewhere before, its hard to be too enthused about Tamiku. Theres an interesting idea here, and kudos to Joysan for nailing the retro feel so perfectly, but its hard not to feel like there should be something more here.", "date": "October 19, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
