{"name": "Last Day of June", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/11/last-day-june-review-ps4-pc/", "text": "I dont think Im giving away too much when I say that Last Day of June is achingly sad. I mean, just watch the trailer. Between its music, its visuals, and its overall vibe, I think it gives you a pretty clear idea of what to expect going in.And if the trailer doesnt do it, the premise will: youre trying to unlock the sequence of events that will save the titular Junes life. So going in, you already know that the death of a loved one is on the table.Even knowing all that, however, I dont think I was quite prepared for the emotional gutpunch that is this game. It starts from the get-go, when a day at the seaside turns tragic, and doesnt let up until the very final heartbreaking moments. I dont want to say too much about what happens, since its the kind of thing thats best left for each player to uncover, but I will say that I cant think of many  or any  games that deal with grief and anger and frustration the way that Last Day of June does.The game is built around Junes widower, Carl, reliving that last day over and over again. No matter how things play out differently  whether youre able to make it so that a child doesnt run into a street after his ball, or so that a womans moving boxes dont go flying off her truck, or so that loose rocks dont go cascading onto the street  the end result is always the same: Carl is always alone in a dark, empty house, getting more and more grief-stricken with every scenario.This may not sound like a set-up that lends itself to a compelling game, but Last Day of June finds a way, playing as a mix between a walking simulator and an adventure game. Carl will look at one of Junes paintings, and then the point of view shifts to one of the other four characters in their little village, as they go through the fateful day. Its an interesting way of letting you look inside their heads, and it also allows you to gradually explore more and more of the village.Admittedly, at times it can feel a little Groundhog Day-ish, as you go through the same sequence of events over and over again, with only small variations revealing themselves each time. But thats okay, as far as Im concerned: each variation reveals a new layer for the town and its characters, and each reveal makes both a little more interesting each time.Id also be remiss if I didnt mention Last Day of Junes art. Specifically: its gorgeous. The games characters all look like eyeless stop-motion animation dolls, which youd think would be creepy, but the way the game tells their stories and has them interact, you get past that pretty quickly. Add in the orange and purple tinges all over the place, and you can see the way the game balances its warm nostalgia and its creeping sadness, even in the visuals.Really, that balance of sadness and nostalgia captures what Last Day of June is all about. Youll come away from it feeling a little heartbroken, but sometimes thats what great art does to you  and make no mistake, this is some pretty exceptional art.", "date": "November 13, 2017", "grade": "A+"}
