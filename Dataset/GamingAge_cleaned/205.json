{"name": "911 Operator", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/04/911-operator-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "As problematic as This is the Police was in many ways, in retrospect, as a police/emergency services simulator, it looks like better and better with every passing year. It had a story that kept everything moving along at a brisk pace, and it balanced that out with the duties associated with managing a citys police force. This is the Police 2 showed how far off the rails things could go if you focused too much on the people instead of the action  and with 911 Operator, we see the problem with focusing entirely on the day-to-day operations of a police station, with no broader story or context.Of course, management sim aficionados may say thats kind of the point of the genre. Whether youre managing a farm, a train, or, in this case, a citys 9-1-1 network, games like this are designed to get you into the rhythm of the job  a somewhat gamified version of the job, sure, but, ultimately, a rough approximation of what its like to do the same thing day-in, day-out.Mind you, 911 Operator feels different to me than any Farming Simulator Ive ever played. Where those games lulled you into a state of zen as you performed the same tasks and routines over and over, 911 Operator does the exact opposite. Between the constant barrage of phone calls from angry, frightened people, calls for assistance from first responders who are watching a situation escalate right in front of them, and, above it all, the regular blare of sirens, the game seems like its designed to make you feel as tense as possible.That, too, is kind of the point here. Without doing any research whatsoever, Im going to go ahead and assume that there arent many jobs as tense as that of someone who answers 9-1-1 calls all day. You never know what the next call will bring, and this game reflects that. Sometimes youll hear from a parent whos just discovered that their child has overdosed on pills, sometimes youll get a call from someone whos being threatened by a menacing neighbour, sometimes youll send officers to respond to a car thats run a red light only to find that the situation has escalated into an armed standoff  its a nerve-wracking experience, and its one that never lets up the entire time youre playing the game.At the same time, though, if youre hoping for some kind of emotional payoff after having your nerves put through the wringer, youre not going to find that here. Your reward for getting through a day without making too many mistakes is not being fired, and maybe getting to move up to a bigger city with even more problems. Again, its true to life, but its not totally satisfying.If that appeals to you, then the good news is that 911 Operator makes doing your job relatively easy. You have a map, you have your fleet of emergency vehicles, and you move the vehicles around the map as the situation dictates. The one problem with this set-up is the same thing we saw in This is the Police: its very easy for a situation to spiral out of control, and the simplified nature of the game is that theres no room for crisis management. One wrong decision, and its pretty much impossible to salvage everything that comes afterwards.I suppose, though, that if youre the kind of person who wants to get a taste for what its like to be a emergency dispatcher, that kind of setup will appeal to you. Personally, if Im playing a simulator Im going to stick with farming zen, but if you want a bit of tension to go with your management simulation, then 911 Operator will give you just that.", "date": "April 26, 2019", "grade": "B"}
