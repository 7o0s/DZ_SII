{"name": "Crackdown 3", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/02/crackdown-3-review-for-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "Crackdown 3 isnt a great game, sure, but is it fun? Most definitely. It has a number of issues both on the technical and mechanical side of things, but I still had a tough time putting it down over the course of the past few days, and enjoyed the 7 or so hours it took me to get through the campaign. It feels very dated in a number of a ways, visually it wont stand out to other open-world titles, and again, there are problems. But if youve been jonesing for an experience akin to the original Crackdown, well, Crackdown 3 delivers on that. The opening sequence to Crackdown 3 sets the general goofy tone for the game, and from there on out its a lot of agent this and agent that dialogue from the ever present leader of The Agency. The plotline isnt particularly engaging, mostly back and forth snippets of dialogue, some over the top line reading from the main villain, and most of the story presentation comes in the way of still images after unlocking a boss fight. Crackdown 3 isnt a game youre coming to for story, but chances are you already knew that.Instead, where Crackdown 3 shines, is when you start to unlock the variety of weapons at your disposal and just start blowing stuff up. The explosions in the game are a literal blast, chaining together mayhem on the city streets, gunning down the mindless hordes of enemies you encounter, and jumping to ridiculous heights as you gather more and more agility orbs rarely gets old. Theres a number of story and side missions to tackle as you make your way further into the city map, with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, often revealing hidden orbs to collect. Youll get access to a variety of weapons and explosives at a quick pace, so outside of maybe the first hour feeling a little iffy and bland, theres a decent amount of fun packed into a short experience here. But yes, weve had far better open worlds available to us on consoles and PC, with a number of notable releases in the past couple of years even. Its been a long time since the original Crackdown and even since Crackdown 2. Its also clear that Crackdown 3 had development issues out of the gate, and it was certainly announced too early for its own good. However, feeling dated or out of place doesnt necessarily equate to bad, and thats how I feel about Crackdown 3s campaign mode. Its still fun, the agility orb collecting is as addictive as it ever was, and theres some decent challenge in the form of platforming sequences and boss fights. That said, the multiplayer half of the game, Wrecking Zone, is something that should have been left on the cutting room floor. There are currently only two game modes to choose from, Agent Hunter which is essentially Team Deathmatch, and Territories, which is a control point mode. Neither are particularly great, and it takes a bit too long to get a match going via matchmaking. Unfortunately, its also the only part of Crackdown 3 which features the destructive environments that were originally touted years ago for this game. However, having now seen them in action via Wrecking Zone, I dont think the main game is missing much. Wrecking Zone also lacks any real customization options for your chosen character outside of pre-set Agent skins, and it lacks any real multiplayer bells and whistles youd find in even the most barebones multiplayer games. Crackdown 3 is certainly a mixed bag, what with a fun campaign mode that does come off a bit dated bogged down by a lackluster multiplayer mode that didnt need to be included. However, its hard to argue against the Xbox Game Pass option, and Crackdown 3 is certainly worth the asking price for that program. I wouldnt pay $60 for it, but $1.00 for the trial, or $10.00 for the monthly fee? Yeah, why not. Its got enough to enjoy, more so if you enjoyed the original Crackdown, and wont take up much of your time.", "date": "February 19, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
