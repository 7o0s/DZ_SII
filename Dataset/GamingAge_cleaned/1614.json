After all, to date, Invizimals has exclusively been the province of Sony handhelds, largely because the series has been tied in so heavily with Augmented Reality tech  which, PlayStation Eye notwithstanding, isnt exactly the first thing you think of when you think PS3. In fact, AR doesnt even have anything to do with The Lost Kingdom; this is just a straight-up 3D platformer that happens to use characters from the series. And its not as if the games existence is an example of Sony neglecting the Vita: The Lost Kingdom was released the same day as Invizimals: The Alliance came out on said handheld.However, even if Im baffled by the games existence, I cant say that Im not glad for it  since, all in all, its a perfectly fine platformer.Not a great one, of course. In the big, kiddie-oriented-3D-platformer scheme of things, Id probably rank it somewhere around the nexus of Knack (what with all the bright colours and whatnot) and the Ben 10: Omniverse series (because of all the people using monsters to fight for them). Which is to say, its got enough adventure that it should keep little ones interested, but its not so challenging that theyll want to throw their controllers away in frustration. Which is to also say, if youre not a kid and/or gaming with one, you might not find it to be much of a challenge.Or, at least not much of a challenge for the most part. The game has some weird hit detection things going on when it comes to exploding objects, since you can be standing nowhere near one of them  or even near the ensuing shrapnel  but still find your health bar takes a hit when they explode. (Ill note as well that your enemies wont suffer the same damage.) Likewise, the camera is a bit finicky, which led to several instances of me walking to my death off a ledge whose existence had been hitherto unknown.Overall, though, those are just minor quibbles. You have more than ample health, and one or two exploding barrels isnt going to kill you before you find one of the many, many health-replenishing plants scattered all over the place. As for the ledge issue, its an annoyance, but The Lost Kingdom features lots and lots of checkpoints, so it doesnt impact things too severely.Which means that the biggest problem with the game might be that the characters you control are insanely overpowered compared to the rest of the world  and seeing as were talking about a platformer aimed at kids, thats hardly a crime. (And to be honest, as an adult who likes being insanely overpowered in games, I cant say I mind all that much either.) The controls are simple and straightforward, and the world is laid out in a pretty straightforward manner. Even the usual complaints dont apply here: the QTEs are over fast enough that it never feels like youre just pressing buttons to advance pre-rendered cinematics, and when you need to swim it feels shockingly fast and fluid, rather than the typical slog.", "date": "October 14, 2014", "grade": "B"}
