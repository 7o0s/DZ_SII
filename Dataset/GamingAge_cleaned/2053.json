Every other Friday when he picked me up wed stop at the video store and comb through rentals, often letting the cover of the box sell us on our selection. And for a while this was a visit into the world that Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus built via the production company Cannon. The Cannon logo that popped up at the beginning of films like Over the Top, Cyborg, and Masters of the Universe is as iconic for me now as Paramount, Fox or Universal.Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon feels a lot like a game Golan-Globus would have produced. Its not nearly as rough around the edges, clearly benefiting from the Far Cry 3 framework its built off of. But the plot, dialogue, soundtrack and emphasis on action really nail that mid-80s to early 90s vibe.Despite the differences in visuals, this is clearly Far Cry 3 with a brand new layer of paint. Neon paint, sure, but the core mechanics remain the same. Rex will clear garrisons, unlock side missions, buy weapon attachments, hunt rare animals, zipline across structures, and occasionally hang-glide from one location to the next. Random enemy encounters persist across the map, and theres a number of collectibles scattered about. You can opt to take out Omega Force with stealth or sheer power, either option remains viable throughout the course of the game.The big differences come from the retooled weapons, featuring one of the best FPS shotguns Ive had the pleasure of using this generation. Other changes involve the streamlining of certain features from Far Cry 3 to Blood Dragon. Youll still gain experience for kills and completing missions, but theres no skill tree to customize. Instead every level either nets you a new health slot or a new ability. Crafting is gone completely, as is skinning animals. Youll still encounter animals across the island, but outside of the Predators Path side-missions, they dont serve much purpose.The other big addition comes from the titular Blood Dragons, neon colored beasts resembling smaller T-Rexs that roam the island. Theyre pretty much instant death early in the game, but can eventually be used as tools against enemy forces. Theyre also as ridiculous as their name implies, not only able to attack and devour anything up close, but they can also shoot a giant laser beam out of their mouth. Thats right, laser breathing dragons. Let that soak in for a minute.While just about everything Blood Dragon does lights up my inner-child, its not a flawless retro effort. Theres an over-reliance on phrases culled from pop culture during the 80s and 90s, often ham-fisted into dialogue delivered by Biehn. Everything feels pretty self-aware, and Im sure some awkward line delivery is intentional. But at times if feels like the writers are winking their eyes at us too much. We get it, the 80s had memes too. It makes me dread the thought that in 20 years Ill be playing a game that forces I Can Haz Cheezeburger lines down my throat over and over again. Theres enough about Blood Dragon that works in delivering that retro feel without the need for constant spoken reminders.I also found Blood Dragons ratio of collectible hunting and map exploring to actual missions and worthwhile content to be a little low. Part of my complaint stems from tying in a lot of gun attachments to collecting the three different item types scattered around the island. In Far Cry 3 I could balance my time between tackling missions and side-missions, and then hunting down some collectible trinkets as a distraction. Here it feels like youre intended to hunt down all the collectibles, complete side-missions and liberate all the garrisons first, before really delving into the story missions.That collectible hunt can get a little tedious, because Blood Dragon lacks some of the clever hiding spots for caves and underwater locations contained in Far Cry 3. And because you really just want to lay waste to everything with a quad-barreled shotgun spitting fire rounds, but first you have to find 12 T.V. sets that serve no other purpose. And then once you get those attachments and plow through the story missions, youve got nothing left to do than take out the occasional three man enemy squad that randomly spawns, or hunt down Blood Dragons for fun.Other more minor complaints stem from the looting system, which earns you credits but also sees you pulling the heart from Omega Force cyborgs that you kill. The heart is used for bait to lure Blood Dragons towards enemies, but you rarely need more than a 5 or 6 at a time. However, every cyborg you kill seems to yield one, and youll grow increasingly tired of seeing the same animation over and over again. I also found Blood Dragons checkpoint system to be a little odd. It has a tendency to checkpoint before cutscenes, but thankfully those can be skipped. But all in all, these are really small issues that didnt detract much from the experience.", "date": "April 30, 2013", "grade": "B"}
