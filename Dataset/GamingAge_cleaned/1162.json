{"name": "Level 22", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/03/level-22-review-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "For the most part, stealth games and I dont get along. They aim to reward patience, whereas I usually play with a run into every room with guns blazing approach. Needless to say, Ive never been able to get into, say, the Metal Gear Solid series.However, I have no problem whatsoever getting into Level 22  despite the fact its all about stealth.Why the different attitude? I suspect some of it stems from the games setting. There are no life-or-death, earth-shattering consequences here. Rather than having the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Level 22 deals with the much more mundane  but also much more relatable  task of trying to sneak into work late. Maybe its just a failure of imagination on my part, but I find it a lot easier to get into a game where youre stealthy avoiding your boss than Im able to get into a story about stealthily avoiding Big Boss.On a related note, I appreciate Level 22s sense of humor. It knows how to be referential without falling into the trap of believing references=jokes. Similarly, it walks that fine line of breaking the fourth wall without constantly reminding you that its breaking the fourth wall  a much more difficult feat than youd think, judging from countless bad cartoons, comics and games over the years. In general, I just appreciate that, rather than hitting you over the head with how clever it believes itself to be, Level 22 has faith that it can tell you a joke once and have that be enough for you to get it.Id like to say that Level 22s gameplay is as new and refreshing as its approach and its outlook, butwell, its not. But thats not to say that its bad, either! Rather, Level 22 plays just like youd expect a stealth-adventure hybrid to play. It requires you to be patient (which is harder for some of us than for others), it rewards ingenuity, and its not afraid to force you to think things through. Thats not usually my cup of tea, but when you shrink it down to bite-sized levels like this, it even draws in someone like me.I dont want to suggest that Level 22 is a better game than its bigger budget stealth brethren. Some of its solutions require leaps of logic that are a little abstract, to say the least. Worse, it has the odd bug that allows you to wander off the screen and into nothingness. You can always wander back, but thats still pretty annoying.", "date": "March 28, 2016", "grade": "A-"}
