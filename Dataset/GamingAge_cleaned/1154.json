Right after you fire the game up, you quickly learn that even though its finished downloading, it still needs to install  an arduous process that, in my experience, takes several hours. During that time, your only option is to play the same game over and over and over again. While this is fine as an introduction to The Show 16s gameplay, and great news for anyone who loves seeing the Royals beat up on the Mets, it also feels like an unfortunate metaphor for The Show as a franchise. After all, over the last couple of seasons, The Show has started to feel a little stale, as if Sony realizes that it basically has the field of console baseball to itself. By introducing the 2016 edition of the game in this way, its hard not to feel as though the developers are preemptively telling you to expect the worst.It doesnt take long for such fears to prove themselves to be unfounded. MLB The Show 16 has all kinds of new bells and whistles, and its more than willing to highlight every single one of them. Every time you open a screen for the first time, it immediately begins explaining everything on the page to you, taking particular care to point out all the new improvements.Some of these changes are on a level so granular you probably wont care, even if youre a hardcore baseball fan. Case in point: I doubt many people will be too excited to learn that the game now rates players on the 20-80 scale used by scouts, rather than the 1-100 scale to which most people will have grown accustomed. Personally, Ive watched baseball for about 25 years now, and I cant say that Ive ever wondered for a moment what 75 speed or 35 power looks like.Other changes, however, feel like a breath of fresh air. Diamond Dynasty, for example, is greatly enhanced by the addition of a battle royale feature. While the game mode still includes the usual here are the dregs of baseball, try to win using them, or spend real money to get better players nonsense that marred previous editions of Diamond Dynasty, this time out you have the option of temporarily building teams through a mock draft, which also includes legends like George Brett, Nolan Ryan and Tony Gwynn alongside your usual roster-filling middle relievers and utility infielders. It adds a bit more dynamism to the mode; whereas the original Diamond Dynasty still feels like a crapshoot thats geared towards parting you from your money, Battle Royale makes it feel like the mode is a little more skill-based.(Ill here note that Diamond Dynasty also has one other new mode, Conquest, a combination of Risk and baseball. It sounds fun in theory, but the reality is that its a lot more confusing than Battle Royale, and youre still stuck with your garbage team. In other words, its basically a fancier version of Diamond Dynasty thats actively trying to monetize you as a players. Its a decent enough idea, and with time I could see it becoming fun, but right now, its more a confusing mess.)One of the other big new innovations: you can now go directly from one game to the next in Road To The Show. This may not sound like much, but as someone who sank literally hundreds and hundreds of hours into a RTTS career in MLB 10, it feels kind of revolutionary.Of course, the big question when it comes to The Show in general is: how bad is online? And the answer is: shockingly good. I realize Im burying the lede here, since The Show has featured abysmal online play since its inception, butyep, its no longer the issue it was. Theres still the odd glitch  things like the announcers saying one thing is happening on the field when the reality is the complete opposite, or fly balls taking weird paths to outfielders  but for the most part, you can now play baseball against random people and the experience wont leave you feeling bitter and hate-filled towards the entire sport. In a year where Sony San Diego were trumpeting all their shiny new innovations, perhaps the most important thing in the game is that they finally got something old right.", "date": "April 4, 2016", "grade": "A+"}
