The good news about Kinduo is that, technically, thats not the case  you need to beat the game, secret stage included, in order to pop a Platinum.While thats a welcome change, its hard to praise Kinduo all that much since not only is it a fairly short game (only 31 levels, counting that secret stage), its also very, very easy, for the most part. I hate to be a hypocrite, but its hard to care about the Platinum not popping until the very end when you can still see everything a game has to offer in less than an hour?To Kinduos credit, its kind of cute. Its a puzzle platformer about a bolt of lightning and a block that are best friends, so thats not exactly a scenario thats been done to death. Whats more, their unique powers  being able to zap switch boxes and explode TNT crates, and being able to push boxes and break glass platforms, respectively  are utilized well here.But still, its hard to be that excited when, again, you can beat the game in under an hour  and thats with the game being prolonged by the fact the block walks pretty slowly. Its not until you reach level 30 and the secret stage (which is to say: the very last two level) that the game becomes even kind of challenging. The rest of the time it feels like youre just doing the same kind of levels over and over, even accounting for the fact youre unlocking those aforementioned powers.Is Kinduo a terrible game? Definitely not  like I said, its cute enough, and its not objectionable so much as its short and easy. If thats all youre after, go for it, but there are much better puzzle-platformers out there to be had.", "date": "April 7, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
