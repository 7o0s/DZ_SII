They describe the game as a JRPG, but it doesnt look like any JRPG that Ive ever seen. I mean, maybe the characters look slightly anime-ish, but thats about it. The combat here is simultaneously turn-based and real-time, every level takes place on a single, static screen, and theres nothing in the way of story or character development beyond a quick plot summary at the beginning of the game. If Wanderjahr counts as a JRPG, then Corecell are taking the whole genre in an entirely new direction.Or they would be, if the game was actually any good. Instead, Wanderjahr basically shows you everything you can do within the first couple of levels, and then sits back and hopes thatll be enough to power people through the rest of the game. Spoiler: its not.The problem is simple: Wanderjahr gets repetitive in a hurry, particularly because you dont have a whole lot of input as to whats going on. You manage your four characters fighting at any given time, and once they defeat enemies you can click on the jewels they drop. You can also decide what upgrades you want to purchase and use, and you can select the monsters youd like your characters to direct their attacks towards. That may sound like a lot of stuff to do when its written out, but its really not. You spend the bulk of your time here just watching and waiting to either use some of those upgrades or switch in one team member for another. It all feels incredibly passive.Of course, Wanderjahr isnt helped by the fact it features some insane difficulty spikes. This is one of those games that doesnt think it needs to gradually build up to boss fights: instead, it allows you to dominate  or, at least, watch your chosen team dominate  non-boss levels to the point youll feel cocky, and then it hits you with near-invincible bosses. It all feels more than a little unfair; coupled with the general passivity, it doesnt make for a very fun experience, unless you like sitting by and watching as your characters get beaten up.To top it all off, Wanderjahr looks and sounds like a cheap cell phone game. Thats not intended to be a slight against cell phone games, either, but a statement on how lacking this game is in the looks department: its really easy to imagine it being played on an old flip phone, and I dont think youd lose a whole lot in that translation.", "date": "December 7, 2016", "grade": "C-"}
