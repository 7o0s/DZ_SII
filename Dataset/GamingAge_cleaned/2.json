{"name": "Valkie 64", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/12/valkie-64-review-for-pc/", "text": "I dont want to reduce a game to a single screenshot, but pretty much everything you could possibly want to know about Valkie 64 can be summed up with this:Not only is the game heavily indebted to the N64 era of gaming, its particularly indebted to N64-era Zelda. You obviously have a female protagonist instead of a male one, but beyond that, everything here  from the blocking graphics to the sword-based combat to the fact there are gems hidden in most of the objects you break  comes straight out of the late-90s.I mean, you could probably have guessed the same from the games name, but the screenshot captures it even more perfectly.Of course, the big difference between the two is that I dont think people will be remembering Valkie 64 25 years from now with the same sort of reverence they currently hold for Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask. This is because Valkie 64 doesnt have much of an identity of its own. It wears its influences proudly, as weve established, and its enjoyable enough if you dont expect anything more from it than simply being an homage to N64 Zelda, but beyond that? Its tolerable, but nothing more.And honestly, even tolerating it will require making some concessions towards quality. The combat is your basic hack-and-slash: you have a sword, and you can use it to parry attacks, but generally speaking youll just be running at every enemy you come across and hitting it. To be fair, both the hacking and the running are better following a recent update, but theyre still nothing to write home about. The same goes for everything else here, too. The music is repetitive piano tinkling that, again, wouldnt have been out of place in an N64 game, but it also wouldnt be remembered today. The world, too, looks exactly like youd imagine an N64 game would look, but theres nothing about it that makes it stand out.Which is a perfect way to describe Valkie 64. Its neat to see someone capture the feel of a bygone generation as well as this game does, but absent any real identity of its own, its hard to see why youd play this instead of going back and replaying the originals.", "date": "December 22, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
