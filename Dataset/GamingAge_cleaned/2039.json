After all, it starts off kind of hard, and the controls are a little tough to figure out at first. But then you get the hang of what youre supposed to be doing, and you realize that thats pretty much all there is to it, and by the second level or so  some random (and frustrating) difficulty spikes throughout the game notwithstanding  thats no longer a concern.So then I thought maybe I my problem was with the genre. After all, its a real-time strategy game, and Ive never been a big RTS fan. But then I realized that 1) there are some RTS games I enjoy  the first Zombie Tycoon among them  and 2) even when I havent liked certain strategy games, I was still able to appreciate their good points and see why some people like them so much (X-COM, Im looking in your direction). So it wasnt genre holding me back from enjoying Zombie Tycoon 2.Then I figured it might be the platform. I mean, sure, theoretically its status as a cross-buy game means that it should work just as well on the Vita as it does on the PS3, but surely the developers had one of the two in mind as they were creating the game. So I tried it on one, and tried it on the otherand found, ultimately, that while there are probably some differences between the two versions, theyre too inconsequential to make a difference.Then I decided it had to be the bugs. I mean, the freezing, the slow-downs  a few issues here and there, and suddenly all the good things a game might do go out the window. And yetwhile the bugs are hardly a mark in Zombie Tycoons favour, I cant say that they had a huge impact on my enjoyment of the game one way or another. Heck, at a few points freezing actually helped, since when I turned my console back on, I was suddenly advanced to the next checkpoint. Im not going to complain about being pushed forward during a game that bores me half to deAnd there it is. Thats why I dont like Zombie Tycoon 2: because, above all else, its boring. More than the frustrating spikes in difficulty or the bugs, the whole game is just a neverending slog. It feels like youre doing the same thing over and over and over: you spawn some zombie hordes, you direct them to move very slowly in the direction of a target, they hit it for a few minutes until it dies/you take control of it, andrepeat. Not even the presence of boss fights or stealth levels can break the feeling of monotony that sets it incredibly quickly. I know that some level of patience is required for RTS games, but this  this is something else entirely. Its just dull, and no amount of excuses can hide that fact.The dullness isnt confined to the single-player mode, either. The games multiplayer consists of a single map and one-on-one deathmatch. Its a little more challenging, I guess, since youre dealing with an actual person instead of AI, but the extra challenge doesnt make it any more fun. Im not going to pretend I played multiplayer very much, but Ill say this: in both of my matches, it took me about ten minutes to find the opposing player. By that point, I was so bored with the match that I sent my sides leader straight into the line of fire, just so that I could get the thing over with. Ill admit that Im not big into online multiplayer, but I have a feeling that embracing the sweet release of death usually isnt the reaction developers are aiming for.", "date": "May 23, 2013", "grade": "D+"}
