First, its a seasonally-themed game that was released just a little before Halloween, and even if I get why theyd time it close to the holiday, tie-ins like that dont always have the best of track records. On top of that, its a 3D platformer that hearkens back to the genres glory days of about 15-20 years ago. As much as I like those games, I dont think its unreasonable to say that modern games that try to capture that same vibe dont always have the best of luck.Impressively, neither of those things are issues here. As far as the Halloween theme, its not just a case of slapping a couple of pumpkins on a quickly-made platformer and calling it a day. This is the story of the titular Pumpkin Jack, an evil being trying to extinguish the good in the Boredom Kingdom. Its clear that a lot of love and attention went into creating the world, and you never get the sense this was made just to grab some money from people looking for something vaguely Halloween-y. Its not a horror game, but its clearly horror-adjacent, to the extent a 3D platformer can be.And as for the 3D platforming, its actually really well done. Unlike some some recent attempts to revitalize the genre, this one mostly succeeds at recalling the likes of early Ratchet and Clank or Jak and Daxter  though admittedly, in this case the eponymous anti-hero doesnt have a sidekick as much as he has a talking crow that occasionally chimes in. But nonetheless, Pumpkin Jack does a fantastic job of making levels feel diverse by throwing in all kinds of different sections, whether its rushing through waves of ghosts and other monsters on the ground, teetering on platforms that tower high in the air, or taking rides on ghost horses and runaway mine carts. Couple this with boss fights that vary up what they ask of you, and levels that actually feel distinct from one another, and you can see why Im so high on this game.Just about the only issues I have are niggling little things here and there that detract ever-so-slightly from an otherwise great game. For example, the game will occasionally send you into a cutscene regardless of whats happening around you, but you can still be hurt by your surroundings as its happening. Case in point: one time I knocked over a candle and set a table on fire a moment before a cutscene was triggered, and as the fire ranged around me, knocking little bits off my health bar, I was stuck in the cutscene.Theres also the fact that it takes a long while for your weapons to have any kind of impact whatsoever. Pumpkin Jack may be evil royalty, but that doesnt mean he doesnt spend the first half of this game hacking and slashing away at ghostly enemies that just wont seem to die. Once he levels up a little this problem becomes less annoying, but it definitely detracted a little from the first few levels.Not enough to make me not love the game, however. Pumpkin Jack is an excellent 3D platformer thats well worth your time, whether youre playing it at Halloween or any other time of the year.", "date": "December 9, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
