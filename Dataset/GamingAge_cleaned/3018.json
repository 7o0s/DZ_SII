I mean, any kind of hidden object game probably works as a comparison, but Wheres Waldo really feels like the most appropriate comparison, on account of the fact that youre searching through larger and larger scenes for smaller and smaller objects.Of course, what made Wheres Waldo work was that it was a book, and you could see the entire page at one time as you sought out the titular character. It works less well on the Switch, where your options  at least when the scenes get really large  are to either zoom all the way out and be unable to see the tiny objects the game wants you to find (and, generally, you still wont be able to see the whole screen), or you can zoom all the way in to a small part of the screen and have the clues that are intended to help you find the objects come off as mostly useless.Mind you, theyre mostly useless anyway, because thats how Hidden Through Time rolls. Most of the time, the clues you get are vague and nonsensical enough that youll just be searching everywhere anyway. This isnt too bad were talking about small scenes and its not a massive pain to search every square inch of the picture, but when you get to the bigger ones, it quickly loses a lot of whatever appeal it might have.That said, Hidden Through Time does have one or two things working in its favour. First, its incredibly easy to play, particularly on the Switch. It may not be fun to look for the puzzles, but, when you play in handheld mode and you can use the touchscreen, its hard to imagine the game being any more intuitive. Theres some disconnect between the fact this is the most family-friendly game imaginable yet it features some near-impossible object searches, but at the very least you can say the game doesnt actively try to get in its own way.Secondly, Hidden Through Time is pretty cute. Its got an art style that comes off as a cross between Scribblenauts and The Oatmeal, and as someone who likes both of those things, that appeals to me. Every time I finished a level, some part of me half-expected to hear that little Scribblenauts tune that played whenever you found a shard, which should give you an idea of just how close the resemblance is.But intuitive controls and fun design dont make for a great game  that would require the game itself to be fun, and honestly, Hidden Through Time just didnt do it for me. If youre a diehard hidden object fan who really wants a challenge, it might be worth your time, but if youre looking for something you can play with your kids, I have a hard time imagining it would pass muster.", "date": "April 6, 2020", "grade": "B"}
