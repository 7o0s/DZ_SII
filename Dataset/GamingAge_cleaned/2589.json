{"name": "Super Destronaut DX 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/07/super-destronaut-dx-2-review-for-ps5-4-xbox-one-series-x/", "text": "The first Super Destronaut DX owed a lot to Space Invaders.Actually, thats understating things significantly: the first Super Destronaut DX was a Space Invaders clone, albeit with some prettier colours. Consequently, I wasnt expecting a whole lot from Super Destronaut DX 2  notwithstanding the same developers mildly interesting foray into FPS territory with Super Destronaut: Land Wars.Not to spoil things, but my expectations were pretty much dead-on. Much like its predecessor, Super Destronaut DX 2 is also a Space Invaders clone that adds nothing to the original beyond some prettier graphics. And while I dont want to downplay those graphics  because, in all honesty, this game looks very nice  theres nothing here that wasnt done about forty years ago.Theres really nothing in Super Destronaut DX 2 that wasnt present in the first game. Rows of aliens come at you, you shoot them all down, the end. This game tries to mix it up a little with some slightly harder levels, as well as mixing in levels where your bullets and/or time are limited, but thats hardly a massive revelation. On top of that, the weapons here are incredibly simple, so you dont even get the satisfaction of massive firepower as you blow up enemy spaceships.As Ive said before, you can usually judge the worth of a Ratalaika-published game by how long you keep playing it after its usually-very-easy-to-obtain Platinum pops. In the case of Super Destronaut DX 2, you get the Platinum after finishing 10 (out of 25 total) levels and hitting a fairly low score in each of the five arcade modes. Unless youre the most dedicated Space Invaders fan ever, theres really no reason to keep playing after that  and, really, theres no reason to even pick it up in the first place.", "date": "July 29, 2021", "grade": "C"}
