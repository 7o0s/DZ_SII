{"name": "Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/02/ultimate-marvel-vs-capcom-3-vita-review/", "text": "I feel like Ive written way too many Marvel vs. Capcom 3 reviews over the last year or so, but while I was kind of lukewarm on the home console version of Ultimate, Ill throw out that the Vita game is an exceptionally well done port, and pretty much sets the bar for what the Vita can do with the fighting game genre. Weve come a long way from the Gameboy version of Street Fighter II, and its nice to see a handheld thats able to adequately go toe to toe with its big brother system.Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 gives you the full roster, stage, and features of the home console version. The only real difference worth mentioning is that the backgrounds for stages are all non-animated now, but overall that feels like a pretty minor loss. Besides that, everything looks and feels pretty damn accurate. Character animation is still top notch, theres no loss in framerate, and everything controls how youd expect.The PS Vita d-pad is turning out to be pretty excellent for fighters, as I noted in my BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend review, and that still holds true for Marvel. There is an optional touch screen control method, which has you tapping on the screen to kind of auto attack and toss out specials, but its not quite what Id call precise.The game comes loaded with your standard set of online and offline modes. Youve got a story based arcade mode, character challenges, training, and simple vs. modes. For the online side youre divided between ranked and player matches, with a number of search options for both. You can also opt to play arcade mode with match requests turned on, which will boot you from single player to an online vs. match whenever a connection turns up.The online play feels pretty smooth throughout, I had little issues with lag and no issues with finding other players to compete against. This will fill out even more this week with the official launch, so if youre looking for a familiar and competitive fighter to mess around with this week, Marvel is definitely worth a look.Visually the game looks crisp on the OLED screen, and the framerate remains steady throughout all the action. My only complaint in the visuals is that certain menu screens look awfully pixelated, as if theyre low-res compared to the rest of the images surrounding them.Besides the content on the cart, when you boot up Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 for the first time with an online connection, youll be prompted to do an update, which will also download the Heroes and Heralds mode. H and H was introduced as post launch DLC for the home console version, and since I reviewed the original prior to that release, this content was a little more fresh for me.Heroes and Heralds can be played online and off, and has you selecting a side to play as and battle it out against either an AI controlled opponent offline or an actual player online in order to wrestle control from the other side. The online mode locks you into the side you select for one week, and at the end of that week tallies up the total wins and losses for each side across all players to determine the victor.The offline mode gives you a grid of locations, with a percentage to build up to in order to gain control of that location from the other side. Along with that, youre give a bingo style sheet of character faces to X out after each victory, and getting five in a row will unlock a special area thatll net you better rewards than usual.The rewards come in the form of cards, which form an underlying mechanic for Heroes and Heralds. Youre able to build a deck out of three cards, and each card has a primary and secondary ability. The cards are based on characters from both the Marvel and Capcom universes, and feature characters that arent selectable in the game.The abilities run the gamut of increasing your special meter fill rate, to causing you to turn invisible after being hit with a 30 hit combo. There are a pretty large number of cards to unlock, with rarities to boot, so if youre into the concept youll spend a lot of time with this mode. Its definitely my new favorite thing about the game, and Im really glad to see it included as free, day one DLC for the Vita release.A couple things worth mentioning in regards to bugs or glitches Ive encountered with this release. I picked up a digital copy of the game, and my initial boot up actually didnt work. The game would freeze up at the Press Any Button title screen, multiple times. This seemed to be fixed when I was able to connect to a Wi-Fi spot, so Im not sure if the game is looking for a connection at the onset but I did have some trouble with that.The other issue I ran into was that the sound would randomly cut out. With new hardware its tough to say whether its the game or the system, but among the 5 or 6 launch titles Ive played, this is the only game that had that issue. It was easily remedied by pressing the PS home button and then going right back into the game, but it was annoying nonetheless.", "date": "February 21, 2012", "grade": "B"}
