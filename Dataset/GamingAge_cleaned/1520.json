{"name": "Criminal Girls: Invite Only", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/02/criminal-girls-invite-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Thanks to my PS Vita, Ive come to learn that not all fanservice-y Japanese games are created equal. There are games with salacious premises that are actually not very scandalous at all (see: Akibas Trip), and games starring young girls that are about as far from exploitative and creepy as you can possibly get (thatd be the Atelier series). There are games like Danganronpa and Hyperdimension Neptunia, that feature fanservice while simultaneously mocking it. There the games that live up to every creepy, negative stereotype of that big broad genre, and then some (AKA the Senran Kagura series). And, of course, there are games like Monster Monpiece and (as you might guess from the fact youre reading this review) Criminal Girls: Invite Only.Obviously, in terms of gameplay, the two games have very little in common: Monster Monpiece is a card battle game, while Criminal Girls is a dungeon crawler with turn-based combat. Unfortunately, however, they both also feature mechanics that arewell, problematic seems like it would be the diplomatic way of putting it. In Monster Monpieces case, it was the infamous rubbing minigames. In Criminal Girls, things are a little more complex, but its still not the kind of thing youll feel comfortable playing in public: you motivate young girls to fight demons by punishing them using whips, shocks, anduhyeah.It practically goes without saying that theyre all scantily clad and in suggestive poses, because why not? And, naturally, the only way to upgrade their skills is by punishing them, so its not like you can avoid doing it  its one of the key aspects of the game.In other words, Criminal Girls is like Monster Monpiece in that it, too, is a decent game thatll be entirely overshadowed by one creepy aspect thatll make you want to shower because it makes you feel so dirty (and not in a good way).Of course, there are differences between the two, going beyond the fact theyre different genres. Where Monster Monpiece was really not very scandalous outside of the rubbing, creepy misogyny is kind of baked into Criminal Girls DNA. After all, were talking about a game in which you  as a male prison guard  are tasked with leading pre-pubescent girls out of Hell, and the girls are all there because theyre delinquents who need to be punished to help them avoid the lives of sin theyre sure to lead if they make it into their teenage years (as well as to help them enhance those aforementioned skills). Couple that with the skimpy clothing theyre all wearing, and you basically have the set-up for some horrible exploitation/soft-core lesbian porn film.Heres the thing, though: when youre actually in the dungeons, searching around for exits and battling whatever random monsters and demons you come across, all that punishment nonsense doesnt come into play at all. Instead, its practically all about the surprisingly intense turn-based battles, where youre juggling party members in and out based on what they can do and making split decisions about when to use items. No matter how distasteful the manner in which you obtain special attacks may be, when youre slugging it out with various beasts that stuff will be pretty far from your mind.", "date": "February 3, 2015", "grade": "C+"}
