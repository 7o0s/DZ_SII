I remember when I was in high school, playing the Crash Bandicoot games thinking they looked amazing. Even when starting into the N. Sane Trilogy bundle, I thoughthey, I remember this scene.Looking back, I didnt remember very wellbecause while the art design has held up great, the technology of the time barely handled it. Fractured, low-polygon everything Textures that were either blurry, far away to hide the low resolution, or just plain fuzzyIts a good thing the art design held up really well, because the HD remaster done on this collection makes the game pop. Visually, its a really solid recreation. Everything looks how youd figure it should, a cartoonish and sometimes garish pastiche of platformer elements and sceneries that just works.However, as much as the visuals and audio have been improvedthe somewhat-janky controls and physics are still around. Ledges are sometimes at a misleading depth, thanks to the isometric view that can hide the games true perspective. Getting to a ledge and slipping off the side, itll happen a lot. Jumping, hitting that ledge, and still somehow falling, occasionally.But such are the trappings of a PSX era game, built to run on some ancient hardware at a time that three-dimensional anything was a brave new world. Whats new, though, is a strange new sort of bug wherein jumps are slightly faster and tend to push Crash forward a bit. These things, while minor, make the initial adjustments from modern platformers to the updated-greatest-hits a bit tougher.That said, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is a really, really good remaster of a iconic 90s game series thats due for a revival. And with three games in the bundle, a remastered cut level from the original game (of which GameShark let you play, back in the day), and a brand-new level with level design and art that make it feel like that revivals probably in the right hands I think N. Sane Trilogy, past its inherent issues from the source material, is a great set thats a no-brainer if youre looking for some platforming action.", "date": "July 3, 2018", "grade": "B+"}
