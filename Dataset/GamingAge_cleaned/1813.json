{"name": "Twisted Lands: Shadow Town", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/01/twisted-lands-shadow-town-review-ps3/", "text": "Lets be realistic here: theres not a whole lot of variety when it comes to Hidden Object Games. There are only so many ways you can contrive to have people searching through scenes for oddly-placed rings and violins and suns, after all  and I say this as someone whos actually pretty fond of the genre. Almost without exception, the games all follow the exact same template: a mysterious story, a couple of go-to locations, some puzzles, and some very poorly-acted and poorly-made cutscenes.Needless to say, Twisted Lands: Shadow Town doesnt go out of its way to break that mold. In fact, it fits so squarely within it, the review I wrote for Mountain Crime: Requital a few months ago could almost be pasted word-for-word here. The cutscenes are almost as hilariously bad, the hidden object scenes are almost as well made, and, on the whole, its almost the same game.Almostbut not quite. See, since the games themselves are pretty much all the same, you need to look a little deeper at certain aspects in order to determine whether individual ones are any good. And its here that Twisted Lands falls a little short.Most notably, the mysterious story barely makes any sense. I know its just a means to the end of making players search for stuff, but at the same time, even after playing all the way through  including the bonus chapter!  and even after reviewing the notes the game keeps for you, I still barely know what happened. There wasa shipwreck? And a virus(?) that turned people into monsters? And some pregnant woman who got walled up inside her grave? I may have spoiled a key story point in there somewhere there, but its a sign of just how convoluted Twisted Lands plot is that I have no freaking idea.As for the rest  again, its almost at the level of Mountain Crime, but not quite. A few scenes here and there have too many shadows, making certain objects almost unfindable. Likewise, some objects are a little too well hidden, to the point I still didnt see them even after using a clue. And, to round things out, finding some of those objects requires a little more precision than youll usually get from a DualShock 3 controller  though, really, thats more likely to be a concern for trophy hunters than anyone else, as one of the trophies calls for completing a scene without a mistake, and thats made significantly harder when you need to grab a stalk of wheat or a flower hidden behind the spokes of a bike wheel.On a slightly more serious note, I should probably also mention that I had a very slight problem with crashes. It only happened in one spot, and that was during the games bonus chapter, but if youre concerned about that sort of thing, be aware that it does, in certain circumstances, rear its ugly head.", "date": "January 17, 2014", "grade": "B-"}
