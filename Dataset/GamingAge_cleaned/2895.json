{"name": "Clash Force", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/clash-force-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Clash Force isnt going to win any awards for originality. Its a retro-influenced run & gun platformer that borrows heavily  very, very heavily  from Mega Man, and does little else.On top of that, its extremely short. As youd expect from a game published by Ratalaika, you should be able to get the Platinum trophy in well under an hour. In fact, if youre so inclined, you should be able to finish off the rest of the game  its only 20 levels  in under an hour as well, and you wont need to exert yourself too much to do it.That said, for what it is  which is to say, a very short Mega Man clone  Clash Force is fine. The platforming is solid, with levels that get more interesting the further into the game you get. Likewise, youve got a nice array of guns at your disposal, and the fact that most of the enemies can be killed with a single shot means you get to feel pretty superpowered.Also, apropos of nothing else, the main bad guy here is an evil scientist named Crackman. That has no bearing on the rest of the game, but its kind of funny.", "date": "August 27, 2020", "grade": "C"}
