Eliot had it partly wrong, at least if youre going by Everybodys Gone To The Rapture. The world ends with a whimper, sure, but theres more to it than that. There are also dead birds. Abandoned cars. Crumpled, bloody tissues. Packed suitcases sitting on beds, waiting forsomeone.Eyes I dare not meet in dreamsIn deaths dream kingdomThese do not appear:There, the eyes areSunlight on a broken columnThere, is a tree swingingAnd voices areIn the winds singingMore distant and more solemnThan a fading star.The end result, I guess, is the same. After the last spasm of humanity, after that whimper, the world is silent. Thats the thing that first hits you when you start playing Everybodys Gone To The Rapture: its so quiet. There are none of the noises you associate with modern life, none of the sounds that most of us unthinkingly relegate to background noise: no cars, no computers, not even any buzzing lights. Just silence. There arent even any birds chirping, because theyve all died.This means, of course, that when you do hear sounds, they tend to stick with you. The few TVs and radios scattered throughout the games world are instantly noticeable, of course; as soon as one of them is nearby, youll know because of the crackling static and that weird, disembodied voice repeating numbers over and over again. Theres something deeply unnerving about walking into an abandoned house and hearing a hum that gets louder the closer you get.And then theres the music. Because Everybodys Gone To The Rapture is such a quiet game, when the orchestral hymns start getting louder, you know youre about to experience one of the games truly affecting moments. For me, at least, it didnt become long before my responses became almost Pavlovian: the music would begin to swell, and instantly Id start feeling tense and getting a little choked up because I knew what was coming.Is it like thisIn deaths other kingdomWaking aloneAt the hour when we areTrembling with tendernessLips that would kissForm prayers to broken stone.Of course, neither the music nor the rare ambient noises have anything on the dialogue. You may not see any people in Everybodys Gone To The Rapture, but theyre there.Or, more accurately, their echoes are there. As you walk around the empty village, every so often youll stumble across memories, and little scenes will play out in front of you. They may not make a lot of sense at first, but as you get further and further in you learn more about these characters: their loves, their betrayals, their heartbreaks, their sadness.Its all very stereotypically British, the way its portrayed. There are repressed feelings and quiet desperation, and lots of people never fully saying what they mean, with little bits of seething anger and indignation bursting through the surface every so often. Much like every other aspect of this game, its impossible not to feel the emotional resonance in every stutter, in every half-hearted mumble, in every sentence thats cut off before the speaker can say what they want to say.In this last of meeting placesWe grope togetherAnd avoid speechGathered on this beach of this tumid riverSightless, unless The eyes reappear As the perpetual star Multifoliate rose Of deaths twilight kingdom The hope only Of empty men.The game succeeds in all this, I suspect, because there arent any people. Where The Vanishing Of Ethan Carters sole failing was that the people didnt look as realistic as everything else, Everybodys Gone To The Rapture gets around that by simply not showing them. Instead, the games various characters are portrayed as bits of falling light. Considering how incredibly lifelike the world is, it was a smart choice, since it means there arent any jarring moments of seeing characters get stuck in the uncanny valley.The light serves a broader purpose, too. Whether its being used to portray people or its simply off in the distance, flitting around, light acts like a beacon in this game, drawing you to certain points and underlining the important bits.Its hard not to ascribe some religious feeling to it, too. Between the light and the music and the story (and, obviously, the name) theres an undercurrent of spirituality running through Everybodys Gone To The Rapture. It may not be the text, of course. With the way the game balances the end of the world with peoples private dramas, it may not even be the subtext. But theres no denying that its certainly there.Between the ideaAnd the realityBetween the motionAnd the actFalls the ShadowIts important to realize that Everybodys Gone To The Rapture isnt exactly a game. Considering that its developers also made the equally non-game-like Dear Esther, this should come as no surprise. Rather, its essential you think of it as a story that you just happen to be experiencing on your PS4. Otherwise, it will just seem like a walking simulator in a nicely-rendered English country village, and then youre just missing the point  and the beauty  of it all.And there is ample beauty in Everybodys Gone To The Rapture  beauty, and emotion, and death and love and life. Its all here, and its all portrayed in such a way that it will stick with you long, long after youve put down your controller.", "date": "August 11, 2015", "grade": "A+"}
