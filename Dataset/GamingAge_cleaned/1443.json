{"name": "Medieval Defenders", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/05/medieval-defenders-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "As I said just a few months ago when writing about Fieldrunners 2, the list of good tower defense games on the Vita is disappointingly short. For every game thats worthwhile (i.e. Plants vs Zombies, the aforementioned Fieldrunners 2), it seems like there are two or three that arent (see: Krinkle Krusher, Day D Tower Rush, Fort Defense, Fort Defense North, etc.). Considering the how well the genre has shown itself to work on mobile devices, you might have figured that the Vita would at least get a few strong ports out of that  but, obviously, youd be wrong.Surprisingly, youd also be wrong if you figured that Medieval Defenders would follow that trend. Itd be understandable to expect, of course. After all, developers 8Floor have been behind many of those mediocre tower defense games, so their track record isnt exactly sterling in this regard. Impressively, though, they seem to have learned from their past mistakes, and figured out how to make a tower defense game for the Vita that doesnt suck.Admittedly, they did this by making one thats about as standard as they come. If you were to picture a tower defense game in your head, youd probably imagine something like this: a couple of different weapons, a couple of winding routes, and thats about it. That, more or less, is what you get with Medieval Defenders  just add some vaguely ren faire-sounding music, and youre done.So what sets this apart from 8Floors previous efforts? In a nutshell: the presentation. Where their previous games featured annoyingly small text and even more annoyingly small areas in which to place your towers, this time around theyve wisely done away with most of the text, and made it so that the game is much more responsive to your finger taps.", "date": "May 6, 2015", "grade": "B"}
