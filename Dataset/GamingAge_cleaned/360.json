Ive played games with difficulty spikes, but Sigi might just put all of them to shame in terms of how vast the gulf is between its regular levels and its boss fights. The game is set up so that you encounter a boss every fifth level; youre likely to fly easily through the first four levels, only to run into a brick wall at the fifth, as lose all your lives and find yourself right back at the beginning before you know whats hit you. It doesnt matter that the easy levels are set up so that you can stock up on lives  youre just going to lose them all anyway.Mind you, if it werent for the difficulty spikes, wed probably be talking about how easy the aforementioned regular levels are. Outside of the boss fights, Sigi is a pretty unremarkable retro-influenced 2D platformer in which you play as a knight fighting off all kinds of monsters as he tries to save the love of his life, a mermaid named Melusina.Mind you, it may actually be a good thing that Sigi gets people to focus on its difficulty spikes, because otherwise they might notice how incredibly juvenile it is. The games full name, after all, is Sigi  A Fart for Melusina, and, as you might expect, theres flatulence in abundance. If youre the kind of person who titters at, uh, tooting, then this may be your thing, but if you arent, youll probably find it all a little stupid.That, however, is assuming youre able to look past the difficulty spikes, and Sigi  A Fart for Melusina isnt designed in a way to make you do that. Beneath its sophomoric sense of humour lies a game that wants nothing more than to crush your spirit, and giving the insane balancing issues, its kind of hard to see why youd let it.", "date": "November 6, 2018", "grade": "C-"}
