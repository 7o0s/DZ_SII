{"name": "A-Men 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/11/men-2-review-ps-vita-ps3/", "text": "Hopefully this isnt being a little too blunt, but I honestly have no idea why A-Men 2 even exists. I mean, I dont know well-received the original A-Men was when it released in the UK back at the Vitas launch, but when it finally came out here in North America eighteen months later, Im pretty sure it didnt set the world alight or anything. Speaking as the critical consensus of that first game (literally!), I can tell you that its not some amazing hidden gem, and judging from the number of ratings it currently has in the PSN store, I dont think it sold like gangbusters.And yet, heres the sequel, occupying the exact same puzzle-platforming niche as the first game. And I do mean the exact same spot  as far as I can tell, A-Men 2 is like A-Men is every possible way. It looks the same, it plays the same, it has the same sense of humour. Realistically, I suspect A-Men 2 couldve been released as a patch replacing the first game entirely, and no one would be any the wiser.Its not as dire as Im making it sound, of course. If youre looking for a ever-so-slightly above-average platformer that punishes you for every little mistake, like the original, I guess itll do the job. Because believe me, A-Men 2 is out to make players lives as difficult as possible. It not only docks you points for taking advantage of infrequent save spots mid-level, there are one or two times when it loaded my save files, only to drop one of my characters right into a situation that instantly killed them. While I dont think Bloober Team have created a HAL-like AI thats out to get you, I wouldnt put it past them either.On a related note, theyve made it so that youd have to be crazy to not use those save points; these are long, long levels, and everything is out to kill you. If you dont save your progress, youre basically consigning yourself to replaying levels until you want to throw your Vita across the room.Equally annoying is the fact that your characters need to be in just the right spots to do anything. Oh, you want to build a bridge right next to that tutorial sign? Then you need to be standing right in that tiny space where its allowed, and not a fraction of a nanometre too far to the left or right. Want to use your grappling hook? Same thing. Want to have your big muscleman drop a crate on the bad guys? Then make sure hes facing the right way, because even though he can carry a giant crate, turning in another direction is apparently too much for him. The whole game is full of little annoying things like that.", "date": "November 27, 2013", "grade": "C+"}
