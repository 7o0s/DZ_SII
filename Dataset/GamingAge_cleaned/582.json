{"name": "Save the Ninja Clan", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/03/save-ninja-clan-review-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "For some games, playing spot the influence is a little easier than others. Take Save the Ninja Clan, for example. Its basically Super Meat Boy with a ninja skin.This is probably a slightly uncharitable way of describing the game, of course. After all, there are plenty of twitchy platformers out there, so its probably more accurate to state that Save the Ninja Clan falls very clearly within a subgenre in which Super Meat Boy is simply the most well known game.However you want to describe it, though, its pretty clear what Save the Ninja Clan is: a fast-paced platformer where you have have to make quick decisions every moment as you jump and dodge you way from point A to point B. Make one wrong move and you die a slightly gory death (though, admittedly, in a much less gory way than its more famous influence); succeed and you can hope to get a good grade.The key question, however, isnt what kind of game is Save the Ninja Clan?, since that answer is obvious. Rather, its how well does Save the Ninja Clan steal from its predecessors? And the answer to that question is a pretty resounding Meh. On the one hand, the game shows glimpses of personality with intentional glitches and little off-kilter messages to the player that suggest the game couldve been made into something much greater than a Super Meat Boy clone. On the other hand, that wouldve required substantially tightening the controls, because what the game demands that you be able to do is frequently not what the game actually allows you to do, on account of the fact that  in the Vita version, at least, youre not allowed to use the D-pad, and instead have to rely on the less precise thumbstick.If Save the Ninja Clan were a full-priced game, that might be fatal to its chances  after all, the most important part of any twitch platformer is tight controls, and if it doesnt have that, it doesnt have anything. Seeing, however, as its well under $5, its hard to be too demanding of the game. Buy it if you want a disposable twitch platformer, and you may be surprised if you dont expect all that much.", "date": "March 7, 2018", "grade": "B"}
