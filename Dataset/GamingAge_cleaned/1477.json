{"name": "Game of Thrones The Sword in the Darkness", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/03/game-of-thrones-the-sword-in-the-darkness-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "If you think that House Forrester had it rough in the last episode of Telltales Game of Thrones, well, things dont get much better for the remaining members of the Ironwood cultivators. Outside of the misadventures of the exiled brother Asher, just about everything that can go wrong for the Forresters does go wrong here, much to my delight. Dont get me wrong, I certainly feel for the plight of Rodrik, Mira, and the others, but this episode does make for some fantastic decision making moments in the conflict between House Forrester and House Whitehill.It feels like we get a lot of story progression in general, despite the running time of The Sword in the Darkness being on par with the last two episodes. I think it helps that the cast is pretty much full at this point, with the added perspectives of Asher and Rodrik, in addition to Miras ongoing struggles in Kings Landing, and Gared Tuttles difficulty acclimating to life on The Wall. This episode bounces back and forth between the four perspectives quite well, giving ample time to each in order to progress and build upon the solid groundwork of the previous episodes.Without going into spoilers, Rodrik has the standout sequence of this episode, one that youll clearly recognize as soon as you play through it. I have a tough time thinking that people wont give in to an emotional response for this sequence, and wont be surprised if the end episode stats reflect the decisions to be nearly unanimous for this sequence. Its probably the highlight of the series so far for me, and its a scene that just makes you feel sort of triumphant, even though the fallout for your actions are clearly going to be ruinous for everyone involved.", "date": "March 23, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
