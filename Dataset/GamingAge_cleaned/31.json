See, the first 90% of it is outstanding. Not only is it one of the most gorgeous games Ive ever played, it manages to build the game around that beauty. Thats an astonishing feat, and it made it easy to fall in love with the game.My dilemma comes with that final 10%. I dont want to spoil anything, but I will say that for that last stretch, Concrete Genie switches from being a game about art and finding beauty in unexpected spaces, to one thats basically a big, long, kind of dull boss fight. Seeing as theres no combat in the game up to that point  at least as far as I can recall (and its a pretty short game, so I think I would remember it)  it comes as an abrupt tonal shift, and one that doesnt suit the game very well at all.That said, while the boss fight means Concrete Genie ends on a bit of a down note, its not enough for me to disregard that first 90% that I loved. Because I really, really loved that 90%. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I had exploring the abandoned fishing pier, searching for blank canvases on which I could create vibrant art. The platforming is top-notch, while the way the game incorporates drawing feels fluid and natural. Sure, its simply a matter of drawing pre-made designs, but the way the art almost literally jumped off the screen was a sight to behold.Its probably worth noting that Concrete Genie is fairly short. I beat it in two sittings of only a couple of hours each, and some of that was drawn out by the boss fight before I discovered I could lower the difficulty settings. At the same time, though, I think the brevity works to the games advantage. If it were a dozen or more hours of drawing the same designs over and over again, itd start getting a little tiresome. Instead, you get a few hours to bask in one of the prettiest games of the generation, and it leaves before it wears out its welcome.Ill even add that my one issue with the game probably isnt that major. Sure, the boss fight doesnt fit in with the rest of the game, but it at least works as its supposed to. Throwing in new mechanics out of nowhere at the last second couldve been a sign that the developers werent confident in how well they could implement them, but thats not the case at all. They may be kind of out of character for Concrete Genie, but they still do what theyre supposed to do.Besides, as I said, Im not about to let an odd ending retroactively spoil a game that was otherwise a delight. In a couple of months, when Im thinking about my favourite games of 2019, Im pretty sure that whatever slight distaste I feel now will have faded, and Ill be left with fond memories of a game thats absolutely gorgeous.", "date": "October 7, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
