{"name": "MouseCraft", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/07/mousecraft-review-ps-vita-ps4-ps3/", "text": "Its not hard to figure out where MouseCraft draws its inspiration from: its basically Lemmings, but with mice. Sure, theres a hint of Tetris in there, and yes, the game makes some nods towards a plot with a few quick cutscenes about a mad scientist, but really, when you get down to it, MouseCraft is Lemmings with a different rodent.On the upside, of course, at least its Lemmings done well. Having endured a pair of mediocre A-Men games that suffered from rapidly diminishing returns, I know firsthand how quickly the formula can grow stale, and thats not the case here. Theres plenty of variety among MouseCrafts puzzling levels, and the game throws enough curveballs at you that it doesnt seem totally derivative. The Tetris connection, for example, comes from the fact that you have to slot in blocks of various shapes to help your mice reach their destinations  not exactly an earth-shattering innovation, but still a nice change of pace. Similarly, you get advance notice on some levels obstacles by watching little rat robots plummet to their deaths, blow up and drown; overall, they may not add a whole lot, but they still provide the game with some fun color.And speaking of color: MouseCraft looks nice, especially on the Vitas screen. Compared to its direct competitors on the handheld  which is to say, those aforementioned A-Men games, plus Lemmings Touch  this game is pretty visually appealing. That doesnt mean theres more to it than a scientist looking ominous in the background and a bit of animation here and there, but on the whole, its nice to look at.", "date": "July 16, 2014", "grade": "B"}
