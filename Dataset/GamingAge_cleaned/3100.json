Even though I was a huge fan of the first one, Ive played a tonne of other similar puzzle games from the same publisher since then, and as much as Ive enjoyed many of them, I was feeling a bit of Lightwood puzzle-related fatigue.Turns out, even if Im a little sick of playing Block-a-Pix and Fifty Words and however many other puzzle games Ive played in the past year-plus, I still cant get enough of Pic-a-Pix Colors nonograms.True, Pic-a-Pix Color 2 is literally exactly the same as the first game. Its still creating pixel art on a grid. The only difference is that the 150 puzzles here are different from the 150 puzzles that made up the first game.", "date": "January 13, 2020", "grade": "A"}
