Even though its been a major part of pop culture as long as Ive been alive, Ive never seen any of the movies (or if I did, it was back in the early days of VCRs, and they made no impression on me). On top of that, Ive only played a few of the many Star Wars games  a little Battlefront here, a little Fallen Order there  so I cant even say Ive had that exposure.Still, I was interested in playing Star Wars: Republic Commando because the original release has a pretty good reputation. So, with this re-release, I was keen to see whether the game still held up fifteen years after it initially came out.Andwell, it looks and plays like a very good first-person shooter from 2005.Thats not inherently a bad thing, mind you. I was a huge fan of the Stubbs the Zombie re-release earlier this year, and while its not a 1:1 comparison  this is a FPS, Stubbs was third-person action  my feelings towards Republic Commando are kind of similar.On the one hand, that means dont go into the game expecting incredible performance. I never played the game on the original Xbox, but I suspect that it looked pretty much exactly like this. Everything is kind of blurry at the best of times, and when the action gets a little hectic, it becomes a little hard to see everything going on.On the other hand, though, it means that the core gameplay is good enough that it doesnt matter if Republic Commando is a little lacking in the looks department. Its fairly linear, to be sure, but its a blast  pardon the pun  when you lead your squad into battle against androids and the laser beams start flying. Whats more, the levels are lengthy and varied enough that even though the enemies dont change up too much, it never feels like youre doing the same thing over and over again.Obviously, given my lack of familiarity with Star Wars, you may want to take my words with a grain or two of salt. (For all I know, this could be a total affront to the Star Wars canon that still has people mad a decade and a half later.) But as a first-person shooter, it works. It may feel like a time capsule from the mid 00s at times, but its a solid enough game that its pretty fun to play.", "date": "July 26, 2021", "grade": "B"}
