Generally speaking, I love me some co-op and online/multiplayer-only games that lack this fundamental feature tend to go unplayed when Im around. And yet, despite this, I was completely surprised by how much fun (and how funny) GCI is even when you have to pass the controller back and forth.The game isnt really anything new, but it is definitely a unique take on games weve played before Its kind of like Arkham Asylum and Team Fortress 2 (why do I always compare to Valve games?) had a baby, and that baby grew up playing quite a bit of Call of Duty. Now even though none of those things sound outright fresh, the combination and spastic over-the-topness of Impostors still does a good job of drawing you in and hopefully keep you playing.As the name implies, this is a Batman game that takes place in Gotham, but Batman isnt really involved. Instead, teams are comprised of wannabe batmen and jokerz (wasnt this touched on in the last batman movie?), complete with makeshift costumes, weapons and gadgets. Naturally this leads to humorous results; in fact the cheapness of the costumes are as funny as the banter of the disturbed individuals portraying the heroes or villains. Its all very tongue in cheek and definitely doesnt take itself too seriously, plus it takes a few jabs at the comic nerd in all of us.Designing and loading out your character play a pretty big part of the games long lasting appeal, as there are massive amounts of leveling and unlocking to do. Weapon mods, costumes, gadgets are abundant and clearly designed to keep the player motivated. Primary weapon, secondary weapon, support item and gadget are all user selectable, so youll have fun merely trying out different combinations of weapons/mods or newly unlocked gear. For example, the body odor sniffers that allow you to see enemies stinky-lines through walls only attach to certain primary weapons, PVC rocket launchers are surprisingly effective compared to the real thing, and items like hatchets offer one-hit kills.On the character design side, most things are cosmetic like face paint, hair style, clothes, masks, etc., but there are different body types which affect your speed:health ratio. The On nbso  behalf of our IT staff and myself, thank you for recovering the critical best-data-recovery.com that was on our dead 2TB hard drive. bigger you are, the slower you are, but the more health you have. Honestly, the action goes pretty quickly so, speed ends up being pretty handy although there are gadgets, like glider wings, roller skates, or grapple guns that really help you to move around maps fast.If I had to peg why the game works to only one attribute, I probably couldnt. Other than its sheer ridiculousness, it really is a straight-forward team shooter. The games mechanics work as advertised, so you cant really complain. That is to say, they work like youd expect them to after playing any contemporary console FPS, which is something I admire. I dont know about you, but I cant remember how many times Ive said to myself, why didnt they just use the such-and-such control scheme? Fortunately, GCIs actually uses whats intuitive for this generations FPS players, e.g. more or less COD controls. Its such a simple and proven solution you really have to wonder why more devs dont use something similar.Game modes are broken into tweaked versions of team deathmatch, capture the flag, and king of the hill. All of which can be played across five (yep, only 5) maps. So, pretty vanilla stuff. Yet the feel of the game is solid and its personality, as mentioned, is exceptional. This is, after all, the same Monolith that has brought such solid first person offerings as Shogo, No One Lives Forever, F.E.A.R., and more recently, Condemned: Criminal Origins. So again, even though it plays similar to other offerings, it has enough flare to stand out even in an over-saturated genre.The only sticking point that bothered me  and from a superficial point of view  was how Warner Brothers (I assume Monolith had nothing to do with it) handled microtransactions. Theyre somewhat counter-intuitive and actually de-value the game that Monolith have developed. You can buy, with real money, all of the unlockable items instead of playing for them. So, just in case you dont want to actually play the game to unlock them, you can purchase items with real monies. To me, this defeats the purpose of any level-progression, which to a large degree nullifies the re-playability of the game. I dont know whats worse; the person willing to buy these items or the fact they theyre even offered.", "date": "February 23, 2012", "grade": "B-"}
