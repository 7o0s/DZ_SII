After all, it was a launch title for the PS Vita in the United Kingdom, whereas were only seeing it on this side of the Atlantic now, a mere 18 months later. I mention this not because I want to highlight how disjointed publishing can be when it comes to the various PSN stores around the world (though it certainly does do that), but rather, to give a little context for the game. I mean, when it first came out in early 2012, the Vita had one puzzle game (Escape Plan) and two platformers (Rayman Origins and Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack), and A-Men stood alone as the only combination of the two. Considering the software drought that plagued the Vita following its launch, it seems fair to say that the game had a chance to stand out.Jump ahead to the present, and A-Men arrives on our shores in a very different context. Suddenly its competing not just with a couple of good-to-excellent games, but a whole raft of them  on top of those launch titles, the Vitas puzzle/platformer/puzzle-platformer library now includes games like Stealth Inc., Dokuro, Little Big Planet, Sound Shapes, and Thomas Was Alone, with Spelunky, Rayman Legends and more on the way. Thats tough competition, and theres no way A-Men can compete favourably with any of them.Which isnt to say that theres anything hugely wrong with it. Indeed, if youre able to forget that list of games I just mentioned (all of which, again, didnt exist when A-Men was originally being developed), you could even call it a solidly enjoyable title. The puzzles are generally pretty challenging  always a good thing for a puzzle-platformer  and its fun to see what functions each of your army men serve. Youll probably die a lot as you try to feel your way through each level, but thats hardly the worst thing that could be said about a game of this type. The graphics and the animations are pleasant, and even if the music can start to feel a little repetitive when youre trying to pass a level for the tenth time, its still decent enough.Unfortunately that phrase  decent enough  also captures the biggest problem with A-Men. You see, even if it doesnt do anything badly, it never feels particularly inspired. It lacks the gorgeous animation of Dokuro, the fantastic soundtrack of Sound Shapes, the brilliantly dark humour of Stealth Inc. In other words, its missing that one thing  that one hook  that couldve transformed it from simply forgettably good to being unforgettably awesome.A-Men also has some slightly more tangible issues, too. Take the controls, for example. This is a game that, at times, requires some pretty precise movements if you want to avoid death  yet I found, time and again, that it didnt allow for that kind of precision. Ill let my possibly inept playing take some of the blame for my many, many deaths, but Im going to blame the game for all those times when I fell to my death because the game was insistent I wasnt close enough to the edge to build a bridge, or when it said Id stepped on a landmine when I clearly hadnt.Likewise, the games save system is severely flawed. Each level has a save point that allows you to avoid starting over from the beginning, but at the same time, youre actively punished if you choose to do so, with points taken from your overall score. Considering how hard some levels are, that system seems counterproductive.Also counterproductive: the camera. Considering the whole point of A-Men is figuring out how all the moving parts of a level work together to let you kill enemies and get to the helicopter, it seems like it wouldve made sense for the game to allow you to see the whole layout of a level. Instead, you can zoom out a little, but never anywhere close to a point where its actually useful.", "date": "August 28, 2013", "grade": "B"}
