ItsWorms. Whatever cosmetic changes (and odd forays into mini-golf) there may have been since the series inception in 1995, by this point, you pretty much know what youre getting when you pick up one of the games: worms + heavy artillery + destructible terrain = lots of fiery deaths and explosions. Thats the Worms formula in a nutshell, and thats what you get if you pick up the franchises Vita debut, Worms Revolution Extreme.This, of course, means that all the positives and negatives associated with Worms are on full display here. Lets start with the bad: theres nothing about Worms Revolution Extreme that makes it an experience you need to have on the Vita. The controls are exactly the same as its PSP predecessors, Open Warfare and Open Warfare 2. Further, theres no incorporation of the front and back touchscreens, which seems like it shouldve been a no-brainer, if Angry Birds has taught us anything. On a related note, if were talking about the PSP, it should also be said that Worms Revolution Extreme looks like it belongs on that system, since the blandly uninspired graphics look kind of hideous on the Vitas OLED screen.Its not all bad news, though. For one thing, the game is as as addictive as ever. Every time I sat down to write this review, Id invariably decide that I needed to play the game just one more timeand then, almost like clockwork, Id look up and see that Id suddenly lost an hour or two somewhere. At its core, Worms has always been almost as much about solving puzzles (albeit very explosive puzzles) as it has been about blowing your enemies to smithereens, and thats just as true this time out as its ever been.", "date": "October 22, 2013", "grade": "B"}
