{"name": "What Remains of Edith Finch", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/06/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review-ps4-pc/", "text": "2017 isnt even half done yet, but Im willing to bet that when I go to pick my game of the year several months from now, What Remains of Edith Finch is probably going sit firmly at the #1 position.This shouldnt be a huge surprise. After all, two years ago, my favourite game of the year was Everybodys Gone To The Rapture. Last year, it was Gone Home. In other words, I have a thing for so-called walking simulators. I love when a game has a relatively short, emotionally-driven story to tell, and What Remains of Edith Finch unquestionably has one of those.However, theres also a crucial difference between What Remains of Edith Finch and those two games: where they had stories that ultimately resolved themselves in hopeful ways, this game most assuredly does not. Without giving too much away  and consider this a big, flashing spoiler alert, in a review that will inevitably have to contain a few  Edith Finchs story contains gut punch after gut punch, before ultimately ending things off with a twist thats absolutely devastating.In fact, thats precisely what sets What Remains of Edith Finch apart from those other two games. Where they tip-toed up to the edge of having sad endings before ultimately having second thoughts, What Remains of Edith Finch has no such second thoughts. It builds to a point where a sad ending is the only one that makes sense, and rather than shying away from it, the game embraces that outcome.Just to be clear, this isnt to disparage either Gone Home or Everybodys Gone To The Rapture. Im the sort of person who loves narratives with happy endings, no matter how unearned they may be, so I didnt mind if they pulled back from the abyss at the very last second. But at the same time, I think that What Remains of Edith Finch is a reminder that a story can feel narratively satisfying while also being heartbreakingly sad.Of course, given that What Remains of Edith Finch is all about a teenage girl uncovering the terrible fates that have befallen every one of her relatives, its hard to imagine how this game couldve gone any other way. Theres no way to relate stories of suicide, or an uncle being hit by a train, or a baby drowning in a bathtub in any kind of positive fashion. Its going to be sad subject matter, no matter how you spin it.And yet, even as the stories are devastating, each of them are, in their own ways, beautifully told. No one gets a simple recounting of their life and eventual death. Rather, you get things like a mans descent into depression being told as a contrast between the mundanity of his everyday life and the rich fantasy world he was building in his head. Similarly, one boys sudden disappearance is conveyed through a flipbook. Obviously, none of this minimizes the fact that every character meets a depressing end, but it at least makes them easier to take from the players perspective  and, taken together, makes it easier to play through the game without sinking into a deep depression of your own.But Im not going to lie: What Remains of Edith Finch is still going to hit you like a tonne of bricks  or, more accurately, like tonne after tonne of bricks, with each tale bringing a new load. No amount of engaging storytelling or beautiful graphics is going to change that.", "date": "June 7, 2017", "grade": "A+"}
