Paul and Jim were a little less over-the-top when it came to Marvels Spider-Man: Miles Morales on PS4 and PS5, respectively, but on the whole, we really love Spidey round these parts.How much do I enjoy Marvels Spider-Man: Miles Morales now that its out on PC? Ill put it this way: I just bought a Steam Deck, and this is the first game Ive played on it. Im not saying that Spider-Man: Miles Morales single-handedly justifies my Steam Deck purchasebut Im not not saying that, either.Admittedly, I may be going a little over-the-top there. As much as I love Spider-Man: Miles Morales (and Ill explain why momentarily), I imagine many people will still find one major flaw: its fairly short as open-world games go. You can see and do most of what the game has to offer in ten hours or so  and given that its now portable (because, again, Steam Deck), you could probably fly through it even faster than you would if you were just playing it on a regular old PC. Given that its roughly the same price as Spider-Man proper (in fact, more expensive at the time of this writing, thanks to Steams Autumn Sale) and only half the length, you can see why some people may take issue with that.Mind you, as someone who often finds most open-world games to be a little too much of a time commitment, I actually greatly enjoyed being able to play one that didnt expect me to sink dozens of hours into it just to get the full experience. As we noted back in our review of the game on PS5, this feels like a streamlined version of a much bigger game (which, really, it kind of is)  and I absolutely loved that.To be sure, it helps that Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an absolute joy to play. The eponymous hero moves so quickly and smoothly, you always feel like the game is in motion, propelling you forward. Swinging through New York is a blast, and you can very easily swoop from building to building without ever touching the ground. Similarly, combat is incredibly fluid, and you can chain together massive combos, pummeling bad guys not just with your fists and your feet, but also with the world around you. Much like the Arkham Knight series made you feel like you were Batman, skulking in the shadows and stealthily taking out your enemies, much like its predecessor Spider-Man: Miles Morales captures the flavour of Your Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man perfectly.It doesnt hurt, either, that it captures the flavour of his city, too. This games New York is an appropriately bustling place, full of people and cars and activity.And, best of all, the game is absolutely gorgeous on the Steam Deck. It runs flawlessly, and the load times are pretty much non-existent. If I think back to how another open-world Spider-Man game ran on a handheld nearly a decade ago, it kind of blows my mind how far weve come  and it also underlines for me just how amazing this game is. Because seriously, this is an amazing game. It may not last that long, but it also never comes close to wearing out its welcome. Marvels Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an excellent sequel to an equally excellent game, and now that its out on PC, its absolutely worth your time (even if that time is over far too soon).", "date": "November 25, 2022", "grade": "A"}
