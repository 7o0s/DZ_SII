{"name": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/12/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Back on the Wii Nintendo introduced the Xenoblade series with Xenoblacde Chronicles. The game was later ported to the New 3DS and we got a spiritual successor a couple years ago. Well now Xenoblade Chronicles returns with more of a true sequel to the original. Yep thats what the number 2 means. Its also a Nintendo Switch exclusive. It boggles my mind that within the first year of this systems debut that weve already gotten some major releases. Well Xenoblade Chronicles 2 didnt miss the deadline and here it is, another huge RPG on this little system. Im also surprised at how great it runs considering the scale of the games environments but Ill get back to that later.So the game starts with this guy Rex who scavenges for scrap and other things that scavengers like. The world is set on the backs of living titans who put the monsters in Shadow of the Colossus to shame. I mean, did you see any villages on the back of the colossi? I know I didnt! But here in the world of Alrest, thats the only kind of real estate you can hope to find. The rest of the place is covered in a cloud sea.Anyway, youre just trying to get by until you get tied up in some rough stuff. Next thing you know, Rex is becoming a Driver who may be the last hope for a world that is running out of room to live and no hope for the future! Theres obviously a lot more going on here, but watching the story play out is part of the fun so Ill just say that I was hooked pretty quickly and I think you might be too.As far as the game is concerned, theres a whole hell of a lot going on here. Maybe youre like me and didnt know what a Driver or their Blades were. Well in Alrest, a select few have the ability to bond with mysterious core crystals. If you dont possess this ability then youre in for a slap in the face if you do try, but for those who can for a bond with a core crystal they will create a Blade out of this process. Blades are kind of like Pokemon or any other game where you use creatures or summons to give you magic powers. In Xenoblade Chronicles 2, youll be able to bond with lots of core crystals and discover all kinds of Blades. Youll want to do this as each Blade has a different personality, element type, and certain weapons that they use. This will come in handy when youre learning more about getting combos in battle. And since Rex is the main character, his Blade (Pyra) is very unique and also sexy. Hmm, maybe I should be a protagonist sometime.One thing I really like in this game is how streamlined everything is. Its almost more complicated to try explaining everything about how it plays than it is to sit down and play it, but since you might be curious Ill give it a shot. Before I do, I just want to say that everything the game introduces happens at a nice and slow rate where even old guys like me have lots of time to get used to new mechanics without feeling rushed to understand everything at once.The battles play out in a way that might be familiar to those who played Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii. I say this because I didnt play that game, but I did play the Wii U game and this feels very different. Everything is mapped to buttons instead of being split between screens, and it works great. Basically your characters will auto-attack whenever they enter a battle, but each time they do it will add some power to your special attacks, or Arts as the game calls them. These will power up at their own rates, but once one is ready then you can trigger it by pressing the face button to which it is assigned.The Arts you have available are based on which Blade you are using. As you bond with more blades, you will find yourself switching between them to access Arts as they are needed. This becomes a game of strategy once you learn to use your Blades special attack which can then be combod by another member of your party. Special attacks are powered up by using your Arts, just like how your Arts are powered up by auto-attacks. These special combos must take place in order of special attack power level. If Rex has Pyra use her special attack to start a combo, it has to be followed by Level 2 of her or any other Blades special, and then Level 3 of the next special attack.This is a lot of fun, but I felt pretty limited in what combos I could finish early on. This is due to a cool down timer which is the window in which the special attack can be completed. Wait too long and you wont have a chance to get that Level 3 attack in, and then you have to start over. If you use an Art just after landing an auto-attack, it will boost the meter on your special attack. Since other members of your party dont seem to know this, they usually take too long to be ready for a combo and you will find yourself limited to your own abilities for a while. Luckily you can use items to extend the window for combos, but the whole thing is something Im still learning about.Oh and if you have trouble figuring out the best time to use an art after the auto-attack, just keep an eye out for damage numbers colored in white! There are also Chain Attacks which use the Party meter to enter a sequence of special Arts quickly combod through your party. This isnt the only use for the Party meter either since it can be used to help up any KOd party members if you have enough power. Seeing as how it took over three paragraphs just to touch on the basics of Xenoblade Chronicles 2s battle system, Ill leave it at that. Just trust that the game doesnt expect you to know all of this at once and does a really good job of introducing new stuff at an even pace. If you do want to know more, theres a good Nintendo Treehouse post here on the combat, or you could just play the game yourself. If you like the series or RPGs, I dont think youll be disappointed!It should come as no surprise that this is one deep game. Trying to talk about any part of it is like explaining to my kids how money works. Yeah, its used to buy things but the thousands of other effects it has on people and the world are so complicated that I just give them $5 a week and let them learn at their own pace. Eventually theyll grow up to be the power-hungry criminals that run things and then I can be a proud father.So how does this game run on the Switch? Well see for yourself. It looks pretty nice overall but you will notice something when playing as a handheld device. Suddenly the game looks a lot crunchier is the best word I can think of. This can get pretty ugly with the more intense battles, but it does look fine overall. This drop in resolution is the tradeoff of having the portability of a console which is trying not to set fire or deplete its batteries instantly when playing on the go. Can you tell the difference in this cutscene?Normally I would remark at how it blows my mind that such a massive game is playable both on the go and at home. It is valid, but less so as we were able to play a port of Xenoblade Chronicles on the New 3DS already. And if you could stand how ugly that was, then even at its worst Xenoblade Chronicles 2 will look like a shiny new car. And not to mention that the game is set on the back of living creatures. At first you think youre just on solid ground in a town and then you look up to see this huge creatures head moving around and totally alive!! AAAHH!That said, I did notice some slowdown in some areas you might expect, and a few which didnt seem that complicated. No matter the case, I didnt let technical issues bring down my enjoyment of this game and it was easy to overlook the tradeoffs for the overall experience of playing a quality RPG. If thats something that keeps you up at night, make your life easier and dont play this one.I do like the visuals in this game, and I also like a lot of the audio! The music is fitting and makes you feel like youre on a great adventure. I wish there were more sounds for all the wildlife that you encounter as I dont remember much about them other than their looks. The voice work fo this game is another story, as I hate the cast on the English audio. Some characters do have good voices, but most of them are a weird fit and just odd. Since Nintendo were good about getting us a copy a few weeks ago, I was totally confused for the first few days as I thought for sure there was a Japanese audio option. Well there is! It just wasnt available until today as it is an additional download. I recommend giving it a shot, since I tried my best to keep the English voice audio lowered. Ill be giving the Japanese audio a shot over the next few days and will add an update when I can. This didnt affect my overall enjoyment of the game and wont be changing the score. Ive definitely heard worse voice acting.Im sure theres a ton Im forgetting to talk about, but just know that thats a good thing. Overall this is a game for any RPG fan. Heck, you dont even have to play as Rex if you want to use a different party member as the party leader. I dont even think Rex wants to play as himself, but he does have Pyra and that creates a tough choice.", "date": "December 1, 2017", "grade": "A-"}
