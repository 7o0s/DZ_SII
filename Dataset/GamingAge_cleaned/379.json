{"name": "Penko Park", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/10/penko-park-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "You really dont have to look very hard to figure out Penko Parks biggest  and arguably only  influence. Its an on-rails photography game where you slowly roll through an abandoned wildlife park, taking pictures of the odd flora and fauna you find inside.Clearly, its heavily indebted to Beasts of Maravilla Island. Im kidding, of course: Penko Park is basically Pokmon Snap. A lower-budget, slightly weirder version of Pokmon Snap, to be sure, but Pokmon Snap all the same.Just because Penko Park isnt exactly original, however, it doesnt mean that the game isnt overflowing with charm. The park is full of strange-looking monsters, all of them looking like they were hand-drawn with care. The same goes for the world itself: its hardly photorealistic, but at the same time it feels lived-in.In this respect, it helps that the more you play, the more you can uncover. Snapping pictures helps you unlock new tools, like a grappling hand and Ghost-o-Vision, which in turn help reveal more secrets that the park is hiding. Again, its not like theres some massive, intricate mystery  the game is only three or four hours long  but it does enough to make you feel like theres more to Penko Park than just getting your timing down to snap three-star photos.And that, in turn, is enough to make Penko Park worth checking out. Its not going to make anyone forget about the existence of Pokmon Snap, but it certainly does enough to justify picking it up.", "date": "October 31, 2022", "grade": "A-"}
