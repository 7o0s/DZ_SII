It got its start on the DS, after all, and even if theres nothing bad about the game on a console, it still feels like the sort of experience that would be better on the go.A lot of the core gameplay would feel a little less cumbersome, for starters. Take searching through static screens for clues. Its not exactly difficult to move the magnifying glass around the screen with your thumbstick, but I nonetheless suspect itd be a lot more intuitive to do it with a touchscreen or a stylus. On a similar note, as fun as the courtroom scenes are (and Ill get to them further in a moment), I cant help but imagine how much more enjoyable theyd be with, say, a second screen where you could see all the evidence currently in your possession so you could know exactly when you bring it up.Further, the whole experience  presented as it is in a relatively episodic fashion of alternating investigations and court cases  feels like it was made to be played in short bursts here and there, rather than over longer periods of couch gaming. Thats not to say that you cant play it for hours on end, nor does it mean that the games overarching story wont catch and hold your interest, but I found that the longer I played in one go, the more repetitive it began to feel.Its also worth noting that the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy doesnt do anything here that its three games didnt do on their original release. True, they have a fresh coat of paint (apparently left over from the games re-release on iOS a couple of years ago), but thats about it. Otherwise, the games are more or less the same as what you wouldve played in their original incarnations.Not that thats a bad thing. Indeed, those original games became famous for a reason, and its plain to see why here. The characters all have personalities, and dont feel (too much) like the cutouts that often seem to populate visual novels. Its also fun to try and piece together the clues you find to figure out what happened, even if it occasionally leads to some annoying trial and error when the games internal logic doesnt match up with how youre thinking. Plus, of course, pressing witnesses and presenting evidence with Hold it! and Objection! will never get old  which is a good thing, considering how often youll hear both during your many hours with these three games.And make no mistake, notwithstanding my complaints about playing the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy on PS4 instead of DS (or, say, the Switch, for which its also available), it is worth spending many hours with the game, particularly if youve never played any of them before. Its got a tonne of fun, engaging content stretched out over its three games, and itll quickly be apparent why they garnered such a following on their original release. Not every game can feel so enjoyable decades after the fact, so for this one to do just that is probably a sign that its worth checking out.", "date": "June 19, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
