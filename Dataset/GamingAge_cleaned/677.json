{"name": "Jydge", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/11/jydge-review-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Just so were clear: Jydge is the futuristic-looking twin-stick from 10tons that isnt Neon Chrome, the futuristic twin-stick shooter from 10tons that came out last year. Its also not Time Recoil, the sorta-futuristic (but more sci-fi-focused) twin-stick shooter that came out from 10tons earlier this fall.Itd be easy to understand any confusion, though, since, really, theres not a whole lot of space between Jydge and either one of those games. In fact, if you were to play me a clips of Jydge and Neon Chrome, I dont think Id be able to tell the difference. Sure, this game is a little more blue-tinged, and that game had a little more purple in it, but essentially, youre doing the same thing with each game: running around a small map, shooting bad guys and collecting loot.I may be overstating their similarities a little. Jydge, for example, has a handy map, along with a medal system for each level. It also offers a greater variety of weapons and loadoats. And the barebones plot is a lot more coherent: here youre playing as a futuristic cop ridding your city of criminals and freeing hostages.", "date": "November 14, 2017", "grade": "B"}
