When I first played the game a month ago, I was ready to dash off a few sentences about how heavily indebted it is to the early days of gaming, add in a few more about it also being a twin-stick shooter, and then call it a day.Now that Ive spent a great deal more time with itwell, Ill still stand by my initial assessment, at least to an extent. Aesthetically, this is a game straight out of the early 1980s. Developers Tikipod have explicitly said that Rock Boshers is designed to recall the ZX Spectrum  and, while I never played one of those, I did play quite a few games on the Atari 2600, and the experience here isnt too far off from that. Bright colors, blocky graphics; no one could ever mistake it for anything but a retro game.Likewise, it fits squarely within the mold your typical twin-stick shooter. Left thumbstick moves your character around, right thumbstick shoots your weapon. It doesnt get any more straightforward than that.And yet, its not just a retro-aping twin-stick shooter, you know? For starters, it not as basic as, say, Crimsonland. Each level is also puzzle, and you need to work your way through it slowly  with an emphasis on the slowly, since youre more than likely to die multiple times in the process of figuring everything out. Enemies appear pre-set points in each level, but those points are never obvious beforehand, which means youll need to stumble across themand remember them for your next playthrough, since youll probably die shortly after they suddenly spring into being. Rock Boshers DX doesnt have one-hit kills, but it does offer only a limited amount of life on each level. Couple that with a hit detection system thats extremely generous to your enemies, and you can see why youre likely to die several times on your way to passing each level.On top of that, theres the games story  a gloriously wacked-out tale involving a young Queen Victoria sneaking away to Mars in search of adventure. Obviously, seeing as the whole plot is conveyed via text screens, the storytelling is rather primitive, but its still a pretty unique plot; after all, when else do you get to play as Englands longest-reigning monarch?", "date": "January 26, 2015", "grade": "B"}
