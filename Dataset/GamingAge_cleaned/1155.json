{"name": "Attractio", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/04/attractio-review-ps4/", "text": "Ive always known that a big part of what made Portal 2 (and, to a lesser extent, the first Portal) special was the writing. Thanks to Attractio, however, I can now state with some degree of confidence that it was the writing (and the voice acting, and the sense of humour) that elevated Portal 2 from being excellent to OMG BEST GAME EVER.Or, to make my feelings a little more plain: Attractio is what happens when you strip Portal of everything that made it great.Sure, that means Attractio still has some half-decent puzzles. You get to play around with gravity and boxes and whatnot, and if you were to look solely at the gameplay and squint your eyes just so, you might even think the two games were kind of similar.Of course, that squinting is pretty important, because thats the only way you might not see how ugly this game is. I know that Attractio takes place in a game show on a post-apocalyptic prison planet (or something like that  for reasons Ill get to in a second, I wasnt paying super-close attention), but that doesnt explain why everything here is such a hideous colour. Or why the character models all look like PS2 refugees. Or why everything looks ever-so-slightly out of focus  not so much that its obvious at all times, but just enough that its guaranteed to bug you throughout your time with it.The problem with Attractios graphics, however, are minor compared to the fact that the game features absolutely atrocious writing and even worse voice acting. The announcer shouts all his lines in a tone that seems tailor-made to make players hit the mute button, while the games few stabs at GLaDOS-style insults just come off as jerky rather than fun. Theres no wit, no sense of humor, no intelligence: just bad writing coming at you via the most obnoxiously smarmy narrator imaginable.", "date": "April 4, 2016", "grade": "C+"}
