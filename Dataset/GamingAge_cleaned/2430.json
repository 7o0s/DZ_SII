{"name": "Gynoug", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/02/gynoug-review-for-ps5-4-xbox-series-x-one-switch/", "text": "Gynoug has an interesting backstory: it was first released on the Sega Genesis 30 years ago  as Gynoug in Japan, as Wings of Wor in North America  and now its been re-released so modern audiences can get to know it.The question is, of course, why theyd want to. Gynoug is a pretty standard side-scrolling shooter. Its a genre that was well-represented thirty years ago, and even if those games arent as popular nowadays, theres still tonnes of them available to play today. Gameplay-wise, theres pretty much nothing here that hasnt been done almost literally countless times before (and after, I guess).That said, gameplay isnt everything, and Gynoug is certainly one of the most visually striking horizontal shmups Ive ever seen. Rather than the usual spaceships, here your enemies are much more flesh and blood  with an emphasis on the blood. Theres plenty of rotting flesh and bleeding organs; one boss is a decomposing torso, while others have bright pink insides that shoot outwards as they attack you. Theres even a level that seems to take place inside a body, which is every bit as gross as youd expect. Its a pretty gory game, all things considered, even if its only rendered in 16-bit graphics.But again, if youre not a fan of shmups  whether upwards-scrolling or side-scrolling  Gynoug isnt likely to win you over. Its a fairly easy Platinum, but other than that, theres not really much to recommend it.", "date": "February 1, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
