{"name": "A Knights Quest", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/10/a-knights-quest-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "It turns out that, despite what I said a few weeks ago, I dont like all Zelda clones, but instead only the good ones. I can say this with certainty because A Knights Quest copies from the same action-adventure formula pretty directly, and I didnt like it much at all.In fairness, of course, the better comparison for A Knights Quest might not be Zelda, but rather Darksiders. A brightly-coloured, kid-friendly version of Darksiders, but Darksiders nonetheless.Whatever you want to compare it to, the unavoidable truth is that A Knights Quest is the definition of mediocre. The world is thoroughly uninteresting, with all those bright colours unable to hide the fact that theres not a lot going on. You occasionally come across other people, but they dont move around much, and they mostly feel like theyre there in this sparsely-populated space because convention calls for it, rather than because the developers wanted to create a world.The combat is equally uninspired. Its almost all hacking and slashing at nondescript enemies, with the occasional use of your shield to deflect flying objects back from where they came from. You pick up powers along the way, but none of them are all that interesting. The boss fights are easily-beaten but take forever, making them the definition of long slogs.The games performance is also a bit of an issue. While I never came across any game-breaking bugs or anything, every so often the resolution would plummet and Id find myself looking at some grainy green blur. It wasnt tied to anything, either  Id turn around in a green field, for example, and everything would suddenly look terrible.Whats shocking, however, is that despite all these flaws  despite everything else in A Knights Quest being as generic as it gets, right down to that thoroughly forgettable name  this game has surprisingly funny. The dialogue is enjoyably sarcastic, and it blends in political commentary in an impressively unobtrusive way, getting the point across without feeling like it has to slam you over the head with it.Its still not funny enough to make it worth your while to play A Knights Quest, though. There are numerous games that do the same thing but in a much better, more interesting way, and youd be better off playing any  or all  of them than wasting your time and money here.", "date": "October 23, 2019", "grade": "C-"}
