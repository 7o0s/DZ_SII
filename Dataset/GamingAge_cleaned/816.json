On top of that, its also incredibly generic: its a platformer where youre rolling a ball from point A to point B. The specifics may differentiate it a little from some of its peers and influences, but not to any degree that makes the game memorable or worth checking out.Id like to say that Im oversimplifying things for effect, but I swear thats not the case. You really are just rolling a ball around a 2D environment. Occasionally you make the ball grow or shrink, depending on what kind of momentum youre trying to build and the direction in which youre aiming for.Not only that, iO isnt even visually interesting. Its got a fondness for the colours blue and orangeand thats really the only thing memorable about it.", "date": "June 19, 2017", "grade": "C"}
