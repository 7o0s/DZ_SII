{"name": "Tank! Tank! Tank!", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/11/tank-tank-tank-review-for-wii-u/", "text": "The Wii U had quite a few games come out on launch day, and as with any console launch these days, the initial library often has a multitude of ports from other systems. Tank! Tank! Tank! doesnt fall into that category, having been an arcade game from a few years back, this marks the first time being released on a console. Normally console exclusives receive lots of press, with previews and reviews pouring out from everywhere. This game has sort of slid under most peoples radars so there may be more than a few gamers out there wondering what its about and whether or not they should purchase it. To put it bluntly, wait for a price drop.Since Tank! Tank! Tank! was an arcade game, its not big surprise that the console version is very straight-forward with very little depth. Its all action all the time and the modes are rather sparse. While you can play the game single player, theres not a ton of variety in the missions. You drive (surprise!) a tank and blow up everything in sight. Youll battle gigantic monsters, like mechanical spiders and flying 3-headed dragons to defend the city. Power-Ups will drop into the game and will give you temporary weapon upgrades, like machine guns, or super powerful bombs and missiles. The game controls are very simple with you moving your tank with the analog stick (or d-pad) and any button on the controller fires. Thats basically it! Like I said, incredibly simple, and in some ways thats a problem. I would have liked to seen more use out of the GamePad. The touchscreen is only used in menus and there isnt any helpful information (like radar or map) on the screen while playing the game.In addition to the single player campaign mode, you can play with a friend in co-op through the main stages. Like in single player, you battle through stages and get medals and experience points to level up your tank. Only player 1 is increasing tank stats, the second player is just there to assist. When playing in this mode, Player 2 gets the full real estate of the TV, and Player 1 is using the GamePads screen. Its a great combination with no split screen needed. The game supports the new Wii U Pro Controller as well as Wii Remotes, Wii Remotes w/Classic Controller, and even the racing wheel.There are multiplayer modes that support up to 4 players  3 people playing on the TV via vertical split screen, and 1 person on the GamePad with a full view. Its here that the game offers some real variety in modes, with 4 player co-op to defeat waves of enemies, 2 vs 2 team battles, free for all death matches, and a unique mode where 1 player is a huge mechanical monkey and the rest of the players are the tanks trying to kill him. Regardless of mode, before you play you will take a picture of your face with the GamePad where you can then alter your appearance by using in-game hats and silly mustaches or eyewear. Your picture will appear above your tank so other players can easily tell who is who in the chaos that ensues. All of these multiplayer modes are fun to play, but the game doesnt support online. With a simplistic game like this, its too bad that Namco didnt put a little effort into online support as this would have extended the replayability of the game tenfold.The games graphics are clean, colorful, and the frame rate seems solid even with a lot of enemies on the screen. This could easily be on competing systems, like 360 or PS3 as there really arent any spectacular graphical achievements here. The music is your standard arcade shootem fare with nothing really standing out. Theres a somewhat annoying guy yelling out combat orders, like GO GO GO!, which adds to the Japanese-ness of this game. Lets just say you wont be wowed with the presentation, but at the same time its far from ugly.", "date": "November 20, 2012", "grade": "C-"}
