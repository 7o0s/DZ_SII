While  spoiler alert  I will be concluding by saying its worth picking up, Im afraid that I cant be quite so emphatic about when you need to do so.To a certain extent, this is unfair on my part. After all, the reason I have nits to pick with Nidhogg is that, from a single-player perspective, it leaves a little to be desired. You can beat the game in under half an hour playing by yourself, and theres not a whole bunch of replay value if youre looking at it through that lens. This is unfair because Nidhogg is meant to be played by as a multiplayer game. Online, locally, it doesnt matter; Messhof want you to play their game with someone or someones. The thing is, I couldnt find anyone else to play it with, which meant I was stuck playing it by myself. Thats not the worst thing in the world  even in those suboptimal conditions, Nidhogg is still pretty fun  but it did mean I didnt experience the game the way it was meant to be experienced.The good news is that, even in my limited time with the game (limited only in the sense I was able to beat it three times in about an hour), I found plenty to love about it. Its a quirky, original game that somehow acts as the lovechild of Proteus and Divekick that I never knew I needed to have in my life. The graphics could easily pass for Atari 2600-era (5200 if were being generous), the gameplay is best described as a hybrid of platforming and fighting (but with fencing and one-hit kills), and the goal of each level is to get eaten by a giant worm. As bizarre and as simple as it all sounds, somehow it all comes together really well. Its a game that calls for good reflexes, and a good sense of when to fight and when to run away, which means that even if you may be able to beat the game on a medium-length bus ride, youll still get a bit of a challenge.", "date": "October 31, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
