It Wait, sorry, whats that? Its not developer Rosevertes first game? Theyve actually been making games for ten years? And I even reviewed one of them back in April?Oh dear.Theres really nothing to say about Takorita Meets Fries other than that its one of the lowest-effort visual novels Ive ever played/read. The story is basic  it follows Takorita, an undersea princess who wants more variety in her meals, who ends up on land and discovers french fries.And thats it.Literally, thats the entire game. She brings a merman with her, they meet two people, she discovers fries, the end. Takorita Meets Fries does include two decision points, but, as youd expect from a game of this calibre, theyre the lowest stakes decisions possible, and you pretty much end up at the same spot no matter what you do. You can discover all the game has to offer in about half an hour, and none of it will stick with you once youre done. And if youre the type who just wants an easy Platinum from a Ratalaika-published game, youll be unsurprised to discover that you can get one here in under five minutes, if youre so inclined.Outside of trophy hunters, though, I cant imagine why youd want to bother with Takorita Meets Fries. Its a low-effort, forgettable visual novel thats not worth the time or minimal money itll cost to pick it up, so you can safely skip over it without worrying youre missing anything.", "date": "December 29, 2021", "grade": "D+"}
