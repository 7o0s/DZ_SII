{"name": "Lost Planet 3", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/09/lost-planet-3-review-xbox-360-ps3-pc/", "text": "Im having a hell of a time figuring out who Lost Planet 3 is even for. Outside of the setting, terminology, mech, and a grappling hook, this feels as far removed from the series as Lost Planet 2 did to 1. Why was it so hard for Capcom to capitalize on the good elements of the original Lost Planet? Thats certainly hard to say, and clearly they didnt figure it out with Lost Planet 3.Instead, youve got a tepid, paint by numbers third person shooter that just so happens to take place on the same ice filled planet as the first game. Youll take on the role of Jim Peyton, a new arrival to the harsh landscape of E.D.N. III, a sort of everyman thats just looking to bring home some money to support his new family. This is the one element that Lost Planet 3 excels at, which is selling us on how likeable and affable Jim Peyton is as a person. Hes pretty far removed from your typical grim and gruff shooter protagonist, and while certainly not goofy or often humorous, he feels far more down to earth than youd expect.A lot of that comes from the excellent voice acting on display throughout Lost Planet 3. This doesnt apply only to the character of Jim Peyton, but to the majority of the characters introduced throughout. Theres a natural element to the dialogue thats rarely captured in video games not developed by Naughty Dog, and its the characters thatll keep you coming back to finish Lost Planet 3 long after the actual game wears out its welcome.Its a shame that the rest of Lost Planet 3 isnt up to snuff. There are some underlying elements here that showcase a hint of promise, but its never executed upon in meaningful ways. Take Jims Rig for example, a giant, industrialized mech that bucks the trend of typical mecha in that its not outfitted with missiles and machine guns. Instead youve got a drill, a big fist, and eventually a giant blowtorch as your limited means of defense against the bug-like Akrid that roam E.D.N. III. While this limited arsenal could potentially give way to intriguing encounters, youll quickly discover that most battles while manning the Rig are identical regardless of the foe, with combat devolving into a glorified rock em sock em robots fight on screen.This holds true for the on-foot combat as well. Theres some waist-high cover mechanics culled from Gears of War, with a weapon loadout that doesnt feel particularly futuristic or inventive. Youll gain access to some more unique weapons midway through, but at that point it feels like too little too late. Encounters against Akrid consist of rolling around while they charge in, and unloading clip after clip until they explode into a pile of orange T-Energy, used to purchase upgrades in between missions. The only time Lost Planet 3 shows a glimmer of promise in its shootouts is with the occasional boss fight, of which theres only a handful present, and a few of them are put on repeat throughout the campaign.Another area where Lost Planet 3 shows promise but ultimately fails is with exploration. This isnt a strict mission by mission story fueled adventure, and allows for some free navigation between sections of an overworld map. But theres little to see and do outside of a small number of side quests, and traversing each area either on foot or in your Rig feels slow and laborious. Theres a fast travel option that opens up eventually, but even that comes with needless restrictions on when and where it can be used.", "date": "September 16, 2013", "grade": "C-"}
