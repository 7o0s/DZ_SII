I cant remember where I heard it or who the source was, and its not a view that I share, but looking at both Metacritic and Game Rankings, its clear that quite a few people hold both the PS3 original and its (expanded and even more highly acclaimed) PSP port in very high esteem.Such people should find plenty to like about PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate HD. After all, the game is pretty much the same as the one that graced the PSP in 2009. The only differences are cosmetic, with the Vita version featuring upgraded high definition visuals and trophy support. Thats not to minimize either of those things, of course; I fully understand the allure of trophies (as evidenced by my Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs and Megamind platinums), and theres no denying the game looks gorgeous on the Vitas OLED screen.But the fact this is just a straight-up port of the PSP version means two things. First and foremost, it means that the game is still not meant for anyone looking for a casual experience. Much like its PSP predecessor, Pixeljunk Monsters: Ultimate HD is hard, even on the very easiest levels at the easiest difficulty, and going far in it requires putting a heck of a lot of time into mastering each level. I dont know if theres a direct correlation between the fact I suck at Pixeljunk Monsters and the fact I dont think the game is one of the best everbut if Im being honest, Id say its pretty darn likely. In other words, if youre not up for being challenged, this probably isnt the best game for you  but if you do crave that, then this should be right up your alley.The other problem (for lack of a better word) with this being pretty much the same game that appeared on the PSP four years ago iswell, just that. The Vita is capable of much, much more than the PSP, and exists is a very different gaming landscape. For example, theres no use made of the Vitas touchscreen, even as iOS games like The Creeps! and Kingdom Rush have shown that tower defense and touchscreen controls go together perfectly. Not only that, but those games also show that  and here are words I never thought Id write  there can be a place for in-app purchases in some circumstances. I feel dirty even suggesting such a thing, and in most cases I abhor the thought of being able to pay your way through a game, but at the same time, looking at my extraordinarily slow progress through Pixeljunk Monsters I cant say that I wouldnt jump at the chance to make some levels go a little faster or have tower upgrades come a little easier.", "date": "August 6, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
