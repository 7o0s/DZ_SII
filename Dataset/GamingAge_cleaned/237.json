It happens when I love the games (see Pic-a-Pix Pieces), it happens when Im a little less fond of the game (i.e. Mixupsbasically, I know Im going to be addicted to it for a few days from the moment I first start the game up.In other words, it doesnt tell you a lot when I say that Im totally hooked on Pic-a-Pix Classic. Given that Pic-a-Pix was one of my favourite games of last year, and that Pieces started the year off on a high as far as Lightwood Games picross games go, it was pretty much a given that Id sink a bunch of hours into Classic, too.That said, I cant say that I enjoyed this game as thoroughly as its predecessors. Part of the joy of those games was seeing how little coloured squares came together to form a picture. Here, with every puzzle using only one colour, the pictures arent always as easy to see. There are quite a few, in fact, where I wouldnt have been able to identify what I was seeing if it hadnt been for the picture description at the very end.Still, even that wasnt enough to stop me from playing the heck of out Pic-a-Pix Classic. Its not quite the very best the nonogram genre has to offer, but its still a solid entry in the series, and if youre like me, youll undoubtedly get your moneys worth if you choose to check it out.", "date": "March 27, 2019", "grade": "B"}
