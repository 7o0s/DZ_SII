{"name": "Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/03/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-generations-review-for-xbox-360-ps3/", "text": "If you tend to regard the quality of anime licensed video games as subpar, then theres a good chance youve been sleeping on what developer Cyberconnect2 has been doing lately with the Naruto license. Their last entry, Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, was a pretty fun and gorgeous looking fighter based around the Shippuden time frame of the long-running anime/manga series, and took me by surprise with how much enjoyed it. So needless to say I was looking forward to what they did next with the series, and Im happy to report that Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations is just as fun.Like the previous Ninja Storm titles, Generations culls from a variety of areas in the Naruto story to outfit its 72 character roster, certainly one of the largest rosters seen in a fighting game. Sure, a few entries are a little redundant, like kid and teen versions of Naruto, Sasuke, and a few others, but if you have a fan favorite in the series, theres a good chance you can play as them here. There are also 15 additional characters that are featured as support only.This game is essentially a 3D fighter, using wide open spaces for arenas and free movement not unlike the controls found in a typical action game. You can string together combos using the single attack button, but change up the combo using directional inputs from the left analog stick. The controls are pretty simple and easy to pick up, but the addition of canceling introduced to the series here adds a little more variety. Besides your standard attacks, you can opt to charge up chakra and use Jutsu, which is essentially a super move. There are a number of variations between characters, including Ultimate Jutsu, which is a super flashy and super damaging attack that ends up being the highlight of combat.Generations, like the Ninja Storm titles that preceded it, isnt the most balanced fighter out there. There is a fairly clear tier style system in place, which most fighters end up having, but certain characters in the roster are susceptible to move spamming and end up being less impactful, especially in online play. If you dont care about being competitive, then it wont bother you much, but if you want to stand a chance online theres a good chance you might not be able to pick the character youd most like to main, and still remain effective.If you dont care about the online side of the game, theres still a lot to check out. The story mode of Generations drops the singular story aspect of previous Ninja Storm titles and opts to divide the story between characters. Youll tackle both a young and teen Naruto tale that covers pretty familiar ground; check out the perspective from Sasukes end in his own story, run through Jiraiyas confrontation with Pain, and handful of other stories. My only real complaint with this format is that some of the story stuff gets a little redundant between characters, but for the most part they try to keep things separated. Like when playing as young Naruto, it wont touch on the battle with Haku and Zabuza, because they have their own story section to compete. Of course, for long time fans most of this going to be old news anyways.Besides the story mode you can check out a few other things, like Survival and Tournaments. Survival is divided up into ranks, and features you fighting successive battles against foes without a break. This means your life bar wont fully replenish after a fight, but if you clear a certain number of objectives in a battle you will get a little boost going into the next fight. The Survival rankings are also divided into a series of themed fights, and both Survival and Tournament are a little more involved than I would have thought, which is nice.Tournament is similar in set-up, in that there are a variety of themed tournaments to participate in. Both Survival and Tournament will net you unlocks, which Generations is absolutely swimming in. Youll also earn more in-game currency to be used in the shop, which also allows you to unlock a whole lot of stuff as well.Online play offers up Ranked and Player matches. Winning Ranked matches will earn you battle points, and you can even participate in Custom Ranked matches to wager your earned battle points. Theres a Ninja Card system in place thats based off of a real world collectible card game for Naruto, which are used to represent your avatar in the online space. These cards also function as boosters for your stats, offering up bonuses to defense, offense, chakra, Jutsu and more.Player matches dont involve battle points, but give you more search options. Theres also an Endless Mode in Player matches which is essentially eight man lobbies, where you can also spectate matches in progress, and save replays. Theres also a nice Beginner mode that locks out higher ranked players from participating, so if youre just now experiencing the series it serves as a nice jumping off point for the online experience.There arent a lot of significant changes between Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 and Generations that I noticed, outside of the absence of both the village to explore and shop at, and the more epic boss battles that involved quick time events. The village exploration isnt really missed; it wasnt that necessary and can easily be accomplished through the menu. But the absence of the QTE boss battles is a shame, as they were some of best examples of quick time events in any video game to date, and really drove home the epic feel of some of those fights. Heres hoping Cyberconnect2 re-implements them into Ninja Storm 3, as Id hate to see them missing in the next entry.", "date": "March 15, 2012", "grade": "B"}
