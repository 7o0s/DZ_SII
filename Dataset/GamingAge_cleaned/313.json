{"name": "Call of Cthulhu", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/01/call-of-cthulhu-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "You know what genre is popular right now? Survival horror. You know what genre isnt? Mystery adventure, along the lines of Sherlock Holmes. You know what game wouldve worked perfectly had it stuck to being a mystery adventure, rather than trying to awkwardly shoe horn itself into the survival horror genre? Call of Cthulhu.I mean, I get why it wants to be survival horror. As I said, the genre is popular. On top of that, its clearly horror-inspired, seeing as it draws heavily from the world of Lovecraft (as its title implies).But as a horror game, Call of Cthulhu fails miserably. Its not, you know, scary. Its slow-moving, and ponderous, and demands that players take their time wandering slowly through creepy environments, talking to people and examining every little object they come across. Sure, there are a couple of moments where youre fleeing monsters or otherwise worrying about not dying, but these are few and far between.(Its not a bad thing that these moments are so rare, mind you. Call of Cthulhu isnt exactly a high-budget extravaganza, which means that when it tries to show offwell, anything, it just looks cheap.)If, however, you look at Call of Cthulhu as a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery adventure, suddenly things dont look so bad. Its got a near-perfect tone, all creepy and gothic. The game calls on you to piece together crime scenes  which makes sense in a mystery, but just slows things down when youre talking about horror. The story isnt phenomenal, but it has just enough unknowns in it that it will keep you guessing about whats coming next, which, again, is what you want in a mystery.You might say that this is all semantics, and that regardless of how a game bills itself, what matters is how it plays. That may be true, but its still worth emphasizing that your enjoyment of Call of Cthulhu will depend entirely on what youre expecting. If you want to be scared, look elsewhere, because this game will just come off as boring. If, however, you want a decent mystery, and dont mind sitting through a few dumb attempts at stealth and scares, then this might just be up your alley.", "date": "January 7, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
