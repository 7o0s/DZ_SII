{"name": "Windbound", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/windbound-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Windbound is a survival game.Im putting that right up front in this review, because I wasnt fully aware of that fact going in. Sure, I knew that the game was about a lost explorer/warrior trying to find her way home, but Id based my expectations for the game on the reveal trailer, which gave off a Wind Waker/Breath of the Wild vibe  and needless to say, Windbound is definitely not either of those games.Instead, as I said, its all about survival. The whole game is built around keeping the main character, Kara, alive as she navigates across the seas from island to island. You have to keep her fed to keep her energy up to allow her to hunt, gather, craft, and all the other elements youd expect from a game like this.There are a couple of issues with this.First, Windbound is procedurally-generated, which means that youre surviving at the whim of a game that didnt seem entirely balanced, at least in my experience. On my first playthrough, my first island was pretty much barren save for a wild boar that I had to chase and stab to death (which, as a side note, was kind of unpleasant, seeing as the boar seemed to be smiling). There were no materials for a fire, so I had to eat the meat raw, which in turn did something to my stamina. Eventually, I scrounged together enough grasses to build a boat, only to arrive at my second island and find it populated by a giant, aggressive, bull-like creature that wouldnt let me get anywhere near any other resources. I eventually gave up and restarted the game from scratch, figuring the deck was stacked against me/Kara.This second playthrough proved to be much more substantial, but it also highlighted some of the games bigger problems. The combat feels kind of disjointed, for example, especially when youre armed only with a knife. It gets better the further in you get (since your weapons improve, obviously), but its pretty rough at first. Sailing is also a chore, since as soon as you can add a sail to your boat, you can sometimes go faster than you can when youre only rowing, but your ability to steer will become much more of a crapshoot.The biggest problem with Windbound, though, is that its incredibly repetitive. You go to an island, you take all the resources you can, and then you move on to the next one. Even though youre allegedly uncovering some great mystery, it feels like youre doing the same actions over and over and over again  which may be true to how you survive in real life, but its pretty tedious here. Ill also give another mention here to the sailing, since it may be the most tedious part of the game. The islands arent close together, and the wind is pretty variable in its strength and direction, so you spend a lot of time drifting along with the current, aiming for an island far in the horizon. In theory it could be relaxing, but most of the time I just found it boring.In this respect, Windbound feels a lot  and I mean a lot  like Summer in Mara, another game from earlier this summer that gave off Zelda vibes initially, before its release revealed it was a whole lot of nothing. To be fair, Windbound looks substantially better, and its not plagued with technical issues dragging it down.", "date": "August 28, 2020", "grade": "C+"}
