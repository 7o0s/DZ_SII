{"name": "Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/02/dragon-quest-v-hand-heavenly-bride-review-ios/", "text": "Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride is hands down my favorite Dragon Quest game ever. I had never played it until the Nintendo DS release in 2009, but I was easily blown away by how rich the world was, how fun the monster collecting became, and how remarkably epic, truly epic, the story was. Its also one of the best RPGs at conveying a true passing of time, literally spanning generations.I reviewed the original DS release of Dragon Quest V, which you can find here courtesy of the Wayback Machine, as much of our early site content has been lost to the digital sands of time. Im just as big on it now as I was then, and the quality of this iOS port being reviewed here doesnt change that a bit. In fact, this feels nearly identical to the DS version of the game in every way, barring the obvious differences in the control scheme.I played on both an iPad Air 2 and an iPhone 6, and had no issues with the game on the most current firmware for both devices (8.1.3). Dragon Quest V looks virtually identical to the DS version of the game on iOS, with the same 2D pixel designs for the characters, and it contains the same vivid, colorful environments found on Nintendos handheld. I will note that theres a slight fuzziness to some characters, as if theres some sort of blurring effecting going on around the edges that I dont remember from the DS release. But outside of that, I cant knock the look of Dragon Quest V on iOS platforms.Ive found no content cut or changed across the dozens of hours Ive committed to the game so far. The soundtrack sounds just as great as I remember it, even if it isnt culled from the superior music found in the PS2 port of the game. Loading is kept to a minimum, and you can suspend games quickly enough, with more permanent saves still being done through town churches. Theres also a cloud save functionality present, making it easy to switch between multiple devices and pick-up where you left off.", "date": "February 1, 2015", "grade": "A"}
