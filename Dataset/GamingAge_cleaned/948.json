{"name": "Root Letter", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/11/root-letter-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Perhaps the most surprising thing about Root Letter is how relatively normal it is. Where games like Norn9: Var Commons or Amnesia: Memories revel in their weirdness with stories about aliens and spaceships, Root Letter is essentially a mystery novel  and a well-written, engaging one at that.Whats more, its got a sense of class and elegance that you dont normally associate with the visual novel genre in general. Maybe Ive just played the wrong games, but when I think of visual novels, I think of confusing tales of romance and high school students, not  as is the case here  of a middle-aged man trying to track down the truth about his one-time pen pal. Its kind of refreshing to play one of these games and not come away from it feeling vaguely pervy.Credit for that, of course, goes back to the fact that Root Letter is fairly well-written, with a well-paced plot that starts off with an explosive reveal (you discover an unopened letter from 15 years earlier, in which your pen pal confesses that she killed someone), and just builds from there. There arent many games that even attempt to play around with the idea of an unreliable narrator, so to see it used here  and to such interesting effect, too  is refreshing.I dont think the game is hurt by the fact that it adds in a few flourishes here and there that mean its not 100% a visual novel, at least in the strictest sense of the term. There are points where Root Letter borrows from the adventure genre, and makes you search around an environment to find the clues you need. Theres an ever-growing map that you need to keep track of, as your search constantly leads you to new places all over town. Theres even a weird little minigame centred around timing your responses correctly, but Id be lying if I said I understood it.", "date": "November 28, 2016", "grade": "A"}
