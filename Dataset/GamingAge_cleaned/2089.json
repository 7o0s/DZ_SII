In an act thats tantamount to serving spaghetti without silverware, Bandai Namco opted to NOT release a taiko drum controller for the platform. Thus leaving gamers with no means of enjoying the title as it was intended (ok, maybe the adaptive controller would come closestbut who has that?). Thankfully the folks at Brook Gaming updated their Wingman XB adapter to support PS4 and Switch Taiko drumsso have they helped keep my hands clean or am having an extremely uncomfortable meal of pasta (yes..Im really hung up on this analogy).Upon receiving the product, I noticed how spartan it was. Roughly the size of a deck of cards, the boxs contents contained a cardboard sleeve with QR codes for the manual and firmware links, a sticker sheet (time to bomb the bathroom of my local drinking hole to rep this brand!) and the adapter itself. I oddly appreciate this approach as it means my home isnt cluttered with another short usb cable that I wont be able to do much with (Im looking at you 8bitdo!). The adapter itself is comparable to a pack of chewing gum and will jut out obtrusively of whatever you plug it into. I did my due diligence and tried to buy a drum locally, at which I was rebuffed by the fact that the Hori Switch drum was reviewed poorly due to how its circuit board was situated and the PS4 drum wasnt available locally and was out of the price range I was comfortable paying for. So while I didnt want to go with an unknown manufacturer, I opted to order this drum on Amazon.Before the drum arrived, I tried the Wingman XB on my PC. Setup was seamless and pairing a DualShock 4 was as simple as plugging the controller into the adapter and turning it on. I fired up Persona 4 Arena Ultimax and ran through the entire tutorial with ease. While this seems like a no brainer for anyone with a working pair of hands, there was one lesson I couldnt pass previously while using the Xbox 360 controller. No matter how many attempts, QcB+C, Double QcF+D was something I could not perform on the defacto PC controller. Whereas with the DualShock 4/Wingman XB combo it took one attempt to get the lesson cleared. I also played and completed the platformer, Flynn: Son of Crimson with no issues on its platforming and boss encounters.The PC tests had given me confidence that Ill be drumming all night long on the Xbox One. so it came as a shock when I plugged in the drum into the Xbox, all I heard was the repeating sound of the down button being pressed. Apparently the drum was triggering some sort of autofiring of the down button. Doing due diligence, I did something I shouldve done first, I read the manual. After it was apparent that the adapters firmware needed to be upgraded. I did that and like everything with the adapter so far it was a simple affair. The adapters resource page also provided an instructional video on how to properly set up a drum controller. Alas still no changeat that point I decided to change tactics, maybe the drum was defective. I booted up Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum n Fun! on the Nintendo Switch in hopes of confirming my hypothesis. Negative, the drum detected and played fine (although I cant say my performance was stellar, but I never was a great player even though I liked the series for nearly two decades). I had to give up the ghost and concluded that perhaps this non-Namco/Hori drum was not tested and confirmed as compatible by the Brook team. Just to make sure that the adapter worked, I used the DualShock 4 and like the PC tests, it worked like a charm.", "date": "April 1, 2022", "grade": null}
