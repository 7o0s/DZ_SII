{"name": "The Witch and the Hundred Knight", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/04/witch-hundred-knight-review-ps3/", "text": "I feel like I should have a stronger opinion about The Witch and the Hundred Knight than I do. Its got all sorts of things that, in theory, should either be amazing or terrible. A couple of bizarre scenes that strongly imply gang rape and cannibalism (kind of). An insane, nonsensical storyline in which you get to play as the villain. Graphics that would barely be passable on the Wii. Action RPG gameplay that reminds me of one of my favorite franchises, Ys. And, most obviously, a title thats an affront to grammar.Instead, Im just kind ofmeh. Not that I dont have moderately strong opinions on some of those things, of course. But overall, looking at the whole package? Meh pretty much covers it.I blame the fact that, more often than not, The Witch and the Hundred Knight loves to get in the way of itself. Seemingly every few steps, youre confronted with endless cutscenes, and every time that happens you have to advance through each individual line of dialogue. Admittedly, there is the option to fast-forward, but, as I learned the hard way early on, the plot here is so strange that one fast-forward and youre almost totally lost.Not only that, theres the whole weapon-switching thing. In certain types of RPGs  basically any where the action doesnt take place in real-time  its all well and good to have different types of attacks work against different types of enemies. When the whole point of the game is to hack and slash your way through your opponents, however, it works substantially less well. As if the games flow wasnt disrupted enough by those aforementioned cutscenes, you also have to pause every few seconds to switch from one weapon class to another. (Its possible, of course, that I just missed the tutorial on how to quick-switch between weapons, but if thats the case, then the game gets docked points for not making it obvious where to find that info out after the fact.)Whats unfortunate about these two things is that The Witch and the Hundred Knight has the potential to be a whole lot better  or, at the very least, more distinctive. Parts of the story may be bizarre, to say nothing of offensive, but they still highlight an approach thats refreshingly weird. I mean, you play as the villains henchman, your boss is shockingly foul-mouthed (her insult of choice seems to be vomiting whore, and she uses it at every opportunity), and theres the sequence in which someone gets turned into a mouse, possibly raped by other mice, and then gets eaten.Like I said: weird, slightly offensive, but highly original. But its easy to overlook those things because youre constantly being bombarded with information and tasks. It doesnt help, either, that the game doesnt even have a consistent visual style. One moment youre wandering around on a fuzzy-looking board and everything looks like it came out of Wii game, the next youre getting close-ups on the characters and everything looks fine. Its mostly hideous, but there are enough times when it looks good that youre just left wondering what the designers were thinking.", "date": "April 2, 2014", "grade": "C"}
