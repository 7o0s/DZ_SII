{"name": "Its Spring Again", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/08/its-spring-again-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Im almost certainly the wrong audience for Its Spring Again. After all, its an educational game designed for very young children learning about the seasons; Im a childfree 37-year-old. I dont intend on ever being in a position where I need to teach a youngun about the seasons, and if I havent figured those out for myself by now, the education system failed me significantly somewhere along the line.Having said all that, I can still imagine that if you were a parent teaching a child about the seasons  or if you, yourself, are 2 years old and learning them (in which case: congrats on being at such an advanced reading level!)  you could do a lot worse than Its Spring Again. Its a gentle game full of bright colours, playful music, and a narrator with a soothing voice who, against all odds, never sounds that patronizing. Sure, its a little repetitive, but theres a lot to be said for rote learning, and Its Spring Again clearly shares that attitude.If you arent a part of that coveted 2-year-old demographic (or at least know someone that age), you probably wont get too much out of this game, though its interesting to consider how similar Its Spring Again is to artsy games like Hohokum, Eufloria, or Flower. Obviously they all have more content, but if you were to stretch Its Spring Again out for a longer period of time and take out the narrator, itd be tough to tell the difference.And, if nothing else, if you want to see a 100% in your trophy list and want to achieve that with only a few dollars and a couple of minutes spent on it, then at approximately $2 and 10-15 minutes, respectively, Its Spring Again will absolutely do the trick.", "date": "August 31, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
