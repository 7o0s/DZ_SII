{"name": "Grand Kingdom", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/07/grand-kingdom-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "To some extent, I love Grand Kingdom because of what it doesnt have. It doesnt have an impossible-to-follow story. It doesnt have impossibly busty schoolgirls wearing boob armor. It doesnt have brain-meltingly stupid dialogue. It doesnt have an ultra-complex turn-based battle system. In nearly every respect imaginable, its very obviously a Japanese RPG, only it doesnt rigidly adhere to all the annoying tropes that go along with the genre.What does it have, then? In a nutshell, the opposite of all those aforementioned flaws. It has a story that doesnt get bogged down in some needlessly convoluted mythology: youre the leader of a band of mercenaries, and youre selling your services to the highest bidder. Theres a plot beyond that, of course, but if you just want the basics, thats what you need to know.Further along that track, the characters here arent atrocious, and the way they interact doesnt make you wish death on everyone involved. They may be a little thinly-sketched, to be sure, but they serve a purpose to the story, and they never get bogged down in squabbles or innuendo.Perhaps because theyre there to advance a plot rather than toI dont know, be creepy waifus or something, Grand Kingdoms characters also dress in shockingly functional clothing. I wouldnt go so far as to say that its true to life or anything, but if youre the kind of person who doesnt want to get side-eyed by other people during your commute/just feel generally embarrassed by what youre playing, this will do the trick.", "date": "July 1, 2016", "grade": "A+"}
