{"name": "Guard Duty", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/11/guard-duty-review-for-ps4-ps-vita-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Guard Duty really feels like a game out of time. From practically the very first scene, as main character Tondbert (the eponymous guard) drunkenly slurs through a couple of sentences and then wakes up with no memory of what happened to his uniform, you feel like youre playing something from the adventure game heyday of the early 90s, rather than a game thats come out a few decades too late to find its proper audience.But better late than never, right? And even if it wont get nearly the audience that something like Monkey Island had, that doesnt make Guard Duty any less worthwhile if youre fond of the genre.In fact, Id go as far as to say that anyone who still harbours feelings for Monkey Island should check this game out right away. Thanks to the pixelated graphics, Guard Duty very much looks like its something you could have played on a PC back when you were paying thousands of dollars for a device thats less powerful than most modern-day smartphones.Better still, even if Guard Duty is heavily indebted to the past, its not a slave to it. The controls here feel much smoother than most adventure games, particularly when you factor in that youre playing on a console rather than with a mouse and keyboard  which is actually much harder than you might expect. Likewise, the puzzles are pleasantly challenging, without ever crossing the line into inscrutable internal logic that occasionally defined some of this games spiritual forebears. Even the writing doesnt feel as self obnoxiously self-referential as some of those early 90s classics.Basically, just about the only thing wrong with Guard Duty is that its thirty years too late to have the kind of audience it deserves. Its a charming, likeable adventure game that borrows from the best parts of the genres past, and its very easy to get sucked into the couple of hours itll take you to finish it.", "date": "November 12, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
