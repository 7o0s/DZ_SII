Each themed table has included varying degrees quirky tie-ins to the popular movie of the moment, funky new pinball ideas and old-school pinball challenges. We were anxious to see what they did with the campy, silly Ant-Man movie.Lets get this out of the way  theres a lot less shrinking than one would expect. The table gets an Ant-Man, a Hank Pym and a Yellow Jacket running around spouting dialogue and fighting, but not too much shrinking. Or Ants.There are surprises, however. The relatively open table makes space for the usual sprawling ramps and targets, including one that leads to a lower level. There are a few little minigames, as has been done on other themed tables. And just like the others, we enjoyed the change of pace. But the highlight is the big, glowing atomic particle in a wire cage up to the right. The pinball can fit through the bars enough to strike the particle. The more you hit it, the smaller it gets, until it sneaks through the cage bars and turns into a second pinball.", "date": "July 29, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
