We get to see a somewhat quick conclusion to the cliffhanger last week, which in turn puts Javier and his brother David in more hot water with the New Frontier group.Whereas Episode 3 felt very dialogue heavy, in this episode The Walking Dead opens up a bit more, giving you some chances to explore your surroundings, something that I felt was missing from the last episode. Theres also a couple of really solid character moments, and a couple of key decisions that could have some significant ramifications for upcoming events.As always, its hard to talk about these individual chapters without delving into spoilers. But there is a fairly satisfying moment towards the tail end of this chapter, which also somehow manages to make things even worse for Javier and crew than they were before. Theres also a bit of betrayal, which certainly taints some decisions and talking points youll encounter towards the end.", "date": "April 24, 2017", "grade": "A-"}
