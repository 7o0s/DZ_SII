{"name": "Metro 2033 Redux", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/metro-2033-redux-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "One of the criticisms that big-budget games get when theyre ported to the Switch is that, more often than not, sacrifices need to be made in order to get the games working properly. This isnt entirely unfounded. I mean, I loved The Witcher 3, and Skyrim, and Bioshock, and all kinds of other classics that have come over to Nintendos hybrid console, but I think its clear that they dont necessarily look as good as they do on other systems.Metro 2033 seems to have discovered the solution to this challenge: make everything as dark and dank as possible. If no one can see whats happening, after all, no one can see the rough edges and papered-over seams.Thats not meant to be a criticism, by the way. I didnt play much of the Metro franchise on other consoles, but I played enough to know its meant to be all claustrophobic and eerie, a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has mostly been forced underground into dank tunnels and where unknown dangers lie in wait to tear you apart. The dark graphics are a feature, not a bug, which means that the game didnt have to sacrifice too much to come over to the Switch. When monsters charge at you through flickering lights, the experience is the same here as youd get on any other console.And since Metro 2033 is based so much around its atmosphere  gloomy, desperate, tense  it works here mostly pretty well. This is a game where you have to scrounge for and preserve your bullets, and where you often have to make the choice to run rather than stay and fight. That experience has arrived on the Switch fully intact.The one area where the game may be a little lacking, however, is the combat. Every so often you have no choice but to stand and fight, and when that happens, it feels like youre fighting with the games controls as much as you are with the monsters. Your aim has to be precise, but not only do you have to contend with lousy guns, low-light and erratically moving enemies, youre also fighting with an aiming system that feels like its working at cross-purposes from you.That said, given that Metro 2033 is a survival horror game, thats not the worst area for this port to feel a little off. Fighting insane monsters with old guns would definitely be a challenge, so in that respect the game is kind of spot on.", "date": "August 14, 2020", "grade": "A"}
