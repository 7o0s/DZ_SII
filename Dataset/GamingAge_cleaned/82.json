After all, their game looks and, to a lesser extent, sounds like it comes straight from Nintendos first handheld. Everything here is varying shades of green, and even if the music sounds a little more modern, there are enough chiptunes flourishes here and there that you can hear the influence loud and clear.Now, theres nothing inherently wrong with that. The Game Boy was a great little machine, and I have plenty of fond memories of sinking hours and hours into it. The thing is, though, the retro graphics are pretty much the only thing Gunpowder on the Teeth has going for it  and, in their own way, they actually probably hinder the game more than they help it.The big problem is that everything here is green. Slightly different shades of green, obviously, but not different enough that you can differentiate between, say, a bush and an enemy trying to shoot you, or barbed wire and yet another bush. Consequently, you spend a lot of time here squinting at the screen, trying to figure out what it is that youre seeing, and you frequently arent able to figure it out until its too late.Unfortunately, thats not the only issue. The platforming is also kind of lousy  which, seeing as this is a run & gun platformer, is a pretty big issue. Jumping from platform to platform is pretty inconsistent, and you can never quite tell just how far youre going to go at any given time. Likewise, you can wall-jump here, except it, too, is pretty inconsistent, which leads to plenty of falls to your death.", "date": "September 1, 2019", "grade": "D"}
