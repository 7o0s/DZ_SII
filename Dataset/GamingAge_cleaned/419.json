{"name": "Gorogoa", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/08/gorogoa-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-switch/", "text": "If youve ever wondered what a hand-crafted, artisanal video game might look like, wonder no more: Gorogoa is precisely that.That, Ill admit, is a pretty snarky way of looking at Gorogoa, and it makes the game sound like some kind of hipster fetish item  when, it reality, the former is undeserved, and the latter is untrue. Gorogoa is so earnest and heartfelt that its probably the opposite of a hipster game, to the point that treating it with snark seems almost cruel.See, Gorogoa is the result of developer Jason Roberts drawing thousand of illustrations by hand, and turning them into a video game. Its pretty clear from the get-go that Roberts put his heart and soul into making these images jump off the screen, and theres not a moment that goes by where you wont feel at least a little bit impressed by the level of detail, to say nothing of how pretty everything looks.Of course, as is the case with even the shiniest, most polished entry in an AAA franchise, theres a lot more to a game than its graphics. There needs to be compelling gameplayand, on that front, Gorogoa isnt quite as easy to recommend.For starters, its very short, and doesnt have a lot of replay value. You can get through the whole thing in about an hour, and once its all done, you wont have much reason to go back and play it again, apart from wanting to see all the gorgeous drawings.On top of that, while Im sure that Roberts has a pretty clear idea of the story hes trying to tell, Im afraid its less clear to me as a player. Or, more accurately, even if I do get it for the most part (I think), Im having a much harder time getting into it. You obviously dont need to be into the story to want to play Gorogoa, but Im sure that it helps. Instead, youre just left with a series of pretty pictures  which is more than most games offer, but thats hardly enough to justify a purchase.Gorogoas biggest problem, though, is also its most basic: its a puzzle game in which the puzzles arent all that interesting. Its lots of moving pictures around to trigger events, and then watching as the story moves forward. When the cutscene ends, its on to moving around the next pictures. Theres some skill involved, but not much  there were multiple times where I was able to figure out what to do next just by clicking around until things happened. In this respect, in fact, Id say that part of Gorogoas problem (or, more accurately, part of my problem with Gorogoa) is that its not really a puzzle in the traditional, video game sense of the word. Rather, it harkens back to jigsaw puzzles, where you usually move pieces around until things start to make sense. Its the same thing here, more or less.Which means, ultimately, that youll have to decide what you want from Gorogoa before you go into it. If you want a mind-bending puzzle game along the lines of, like, Portal or something, its not going to deliver that, and youll want to stay away. If, however, you want a gentle puzzle game with heartfelt visuals, that will remind you of life pre-gaming, then Gorogoa offers a solid  if brief  experience.", "date": "August 30, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
