{"name": "Atelier Meruru Plus: The Apprentice of Arland", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/09/atelier-meruru-plus-apprentice-arland-review-ps-vita/", "text": "For the first half hour or so of Atelier Meruru Plus, I was ready to write the game off as a slightly repackaged version of Atelier Totori Plus. It looks the same; it has the same basic plot (girl dreams of becoming an alchemist); it even has a few of the same characters. While there are certainly worse things in the world to be than Atelier Totori Part II, of course, that wouldnt make the game particularly appealing to anyone outside of a very specific, JRPG-loving niche.And then, around the end of that half hour mark, the cut scenes end, the game opens up, and you get to discover that Atelier Meruru Plus is actually a completely different game. Where Totori Plus was focussed on one girls quest to become an alchemist, Meruru Plus is about one girls quest to build up an entire kingdom.Admittedly, shes trying to do so through her work as an alchemist, which means that the two games have a lot in common. Youll still have to grind through lots of turn-based combat to obtain ingredients, youll still have to mix and match those ingredients to get the most out of your concoctions, and youll still have to go on all kinds of repetitive quests. On top of that, youll be doing it all as a barely pubescent girl, so youd better get used to lots of running around in bloomers.The key difference  at least for me  is that it all seems to have a point in Atelier Meruru Plus. Not to take anything away from its Vita predecessor, but Totori Plus focus on its heroines personal growth meant that the stakes never seemed all that high. Here, by contrast, youre charged with building up a place for people to live. You have to build new buildings, attract more people, and keep the populace happy. This gives the whole thing a certain strategic feel. While no one would ever mistake it for Risk or Sim City (or whatever other strategy/city-building you want to name), I still liked feeling like my decisions had some kind weight to them, like they affected more people than just the games titular character.Interestingly, even though the decisions are weightier, the game places less pressure on you to get everything done. Whereas Totoris calendar was pushed forward by every quest and task having a due date, in Meruru you only have one date: the three-year deadline. Its up to you what quests you want to take on and in which order, and youre given as much time as you want to finish them. This may seem like a small change, but in reality, it adds to the sense that you need to think strategically (even if most of the quests tend to repeat themselves after awhile).Now, I can understand if youre a little skeptical of this. I mean, going by the superficial stuff, Atelier Meruru Plus seems like it should be just another JRPG. But look deeper, and youll find that its actually a lot more interesting, and addictive, than you could imagine.", "date": "September 17, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
