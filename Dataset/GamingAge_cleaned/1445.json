{"name": "Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/04/shadow-warrior-3-definitive-edition-review-for-pc-playstation-xbox/", "text": "Like Tyler with the basic version of the game last year, I went into Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition with no prior experience with the franchise  or any idea of what I was getting into. And for the most part, my takeaways from Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition are fairly similar to Tylers and the base game: there are strong DOOM 2016/Doom Eternal vibes running throughout the game, youll max out your characters upgrades awfully quickly, and you probably wont need to play it a second time  even if this Definitive Edition brings with it New Game Plus, harder difficulty modes, and a chapter select so you can go back and replay your favourite parts.However, where some people may view things like the lack of replayability and the quick upgrades as negatives, for me theyre only positive. In a game like Shadow Warrior 3 thats all about ripping through enemies and cracking wise while youre doing it, I like being able to feel like my character is a little overpowered. While this may go against the spirit of the first two games (judging from the Steam reviews), it feels like itd be against the spirit of this game to have Lo Wang slowly but surely grinding his way through enemies and gradually increasing his powers. Is it stupid? Of course it is. But thats the point of Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition. Its meant to be ludicrously over-the-top, as Wang makes constant dirty jokes that barely qualify as single entendres while slicing, dicing, and blasting his way through enemies that explode in gore. For me, itd feel sillier if the game was solemn and serious, and then Wang turned around, blasted a demon with something that looks suspiciously like Iron Mans repulsors, and ripped another demons head straight out of its body, spinal cord and all. Even looking beyond the violence, I dont think slow progression and grinding would be compatible with a game that moves as quickly as this one. Throughout Shadow Warrior 3, it feels like youre constantly in motion, whether youre jumping from platform to platform, swinging from ledges with a grappling hook, or parkouring along walls. Wang is a constant source of kinetic energy, and I suspect that this comes off much better in a game that lasts 5-6 hours than it would if the game were twice as long.Admittedly, given that I havent played the first two post-reboot Shadow Warrior games, I completely understand why some people might be upset if Shadow Warrior 3 is, indeed, a complete departure for the series. But I cant judge Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition on how well it matches up with its predecessors. What I can do, however, is judge Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition on how much fun it is  and by that metric, I cant imagine a more enjoyable game.", "date": "April 6, 2023", "grade": "A"}
