{"name": "Blue Collar Astronaut", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/07/blue-collar-astronaut-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "As is much, much less often the case, the retro games inspiring Blue Collar Astronaut go back a little further than NES or SNES. In fact, its roots can be found in the dawn of gaming, in the Lunar Lander-style games that dotted the collective landscapes of early consoles and console predecessors like the Atari, the ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64. The graphics may be significantly better, and there may be more of a story (nearly all of which can be summarized just by reading the games name), but at its core, Blue Collar Astronaut isnt all that different from the titles that inspired the earliest gamers.Of course, because its antecedents and its required skills are so specific, it should come as no surprise that this game is probably only going to appeal to a certain subset of people. Appreciating Blue Collar Astronaut demands that youve got not only a deep and abiding love for physics-based games, but also a high tolerance for frustration. After all, were talking about a game that requires near-perfect precision right when you launch your spacecraft, but where you dont discover whether your trajectory is correct until its pretty much too late to change anything. With a set-up like that, it should come as no surprise that constant failure is a feature in this game, not a bug.As with most games coming from that kind of mindset, it shouldnt be too shocking to learn that the game doesnt go out of its way to help you, either. There is a tutorial  one that gets pretty lengthy if you want it to be, in fact  but it doesnt change the fact that the controls are kind of clunky. Blue Collar Astronaut may expect that players be able to turn quickly, accelerate at just the right speed, and land without exploding, but that doesnt mean its going to make any of those things easy to do.", "date": "July 17, 2017", "grade": "B-"}
