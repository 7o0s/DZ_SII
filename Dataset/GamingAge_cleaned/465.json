Its even rarer still for me to be so amazed by a games writing that, years later, Im able to look back on it with fondness. But thats the case for me with Thomas Was Alone. I played it (and raved about it) a little over five years ago, and it still stands out as one of my all-time favourites  in large part because the writing (and accompanying narration) was just so exceptional.It was so exceptional, in fact, that it led me to not only have insanely high hopes for Volume, the second game from Thomas Was Alones creator, Mike Bithell, but also to be instantly interested in Subsurface Circular, Bithells latest game for the Switch. And where Volume left me feeling a little letdown, Im very pleased to report that Subsurface Circular lives up to the high standards Bithell set with his debut.It does so because the game finds Bithell playing to his strengths: writing. See, Subsurface Circular is essentially a text-based adventure. Theres a visual element, but its nothing special. The gameplay literally just consists of robots getting on and off a subway and talking with each other. The robots look absolutely incredible, mind you, but still, its not the most visually interesting game.This means that Subsurface Circular lives and dies by its writing. If the story or the conversations were anything less than fascinating, the game would have failed. That it doesnt is a testament to how great Bithell is at telling a story.And what is that story? Without giving away too much of Subsurface Circulars fantastic mystery, I can tell you that youre controlling a robot detective investigating another robots disappearance, which he (it?) discovered in the course of making casual conversation with another subway passenger (also a robot). From that initial conversation, you uncover more and more of the story in bits and pieces from subsequent passengers, while at the same time learning all about the world above you. Despite the action never leaving a single subway car, the world is so richly-imagined, and the story so compelling, its impossible not to get drawn in.It helps, of course, that the whole thing can be solved in a single sitting. If youre looking for a game that will occupy your time for days on end, this isnt it  youll be able to figure out its mystery in around an hour. Its also not the kind of game that you can go back to again and again  it is, after all, a mystery, and the story isnt going to change in subsequent playthroughs (apart, that is, from the ending, but even thats determined by the player at the very end of the game).As someone wholl take a concentrated dose of exceptional storytelling over an endless slog of repetitive tasks and quests, I cant say that the brevity or the lack of replayability bothers me all that much. All I really want is to hear/read an incredible story  well, that, and a genuinely great follow-up to Thomas Was Alone. Luckily, Subsurface Circular delivers on both.", "date": "July 17, 2018", "grade": "A+"}
