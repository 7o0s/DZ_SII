Theres no matching or tapping or any of that nonsense usually associated with F2P games. Instead, its a turn-based RPG/strategy game, with a heavy dose ofI dont know, Magic (or some other card-based game) thrown in for good measure. Theres no restrictions on how many times per day you can play, and theres not really any Share to get X! going on, either. It might help your game a little if you want to spend money to get better orbs, but in general, you earn more than enough of those just playing the game.What makes it all work, of course, is that it is a game youll want to keep playing. Ive never been big on strategy games, and Ive never been able to figure out how card games work, but Destiny of Spirits makes it all seem like the easiest stuff in the world. Its not quite strategy for dummies or anything (at least, I dont think it is), but everything is presented so clearly and intuitively that it sucks you in almost right away. I mean, there are definitely intricacies I dont quite get, but the basic gameplay is incredibly easy to grasp, and the difficulty increases at the perfect level of challenging-but-not-too-challenging.And what is the gameplay, exactly? As I said, its a little bit turn-based strategy, a little bit RPG, and a little bit Magic. Youre given a few spirits to start the game, and you take them around the world  literally, since its all location-based  fighting demons in turn-based battles. The location stuff actually has a use, too, in that you can rent (for lack of a better term) spirits from elsewhere in the world to fight alongside your squad, and different places and strengths bring different levels of compatibility. Its executed incredibly well, and the matches all happen so quickly its easy to get addicted.Unfortunately, the location stuff is also tied to the games one major flaw. In order to access it, you need to be onlineand, for some reason, I consistently had a really hard time connecting to the server. Maybe I just had lousy timing or horrible luck, but it seemed like half the time I started Destiny of Spirits up, Id get a message that the server was undergoing maintenance, and Id get booted back to the title screen.", "date": "May 2, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
