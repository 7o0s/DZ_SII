Its true for novels, its true for movies, and its true for video games.In fact, Id say it goes double for visual novels like Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition. And, I have to admit, Im speaking from accidental experience. See, the game boasts of a gameplay mechanic called the Senses Sympathy System (SSS), which allows you to shape its story by setting your level of friendliness towards each of the main characters you encounter. You trigger the SSS by pressing Select  which, as anyone whos held a Vita knows, is right next to the Start button, which, in turn, is how you fast-forward text in this game.Needless to say, there were several times where I went to trigger the SSS  and several more where I just meant to pause the game, forgetting that you do that with another button  which led to Root Double progressing through its plot at a furious pacewhich is how, as I said, I discovered that Root Doubles text could probably have used, say, a second draft.To be fair, endless exposition and dialogue is kind of Root Doubles thing. In fact, its practically its reason for being. As its full title implies, the game tells the story of a horrible disaster from two perspectives: the days leading up to it (thatd be the Before Crimes part), as well as its immediate aftermath (After Days, naturally). With that much plot to get through, its understandable if the game doesnt skimp on the plot points.On top of that, Root Double tries to give as full a story as possible for everyone involved. Yes, there are characters who could exist in literally any other Japanese visual novel, and yes, the female characters in particular dress and occasionally act like stereotypes. But, at the same time, Root Double fleshes out more of its characters better than many other games of its ilk. Itd be hypocritical of me to complain about other visual novels being populated by cardboard cutout characters, and then also complain here, when the characters arent cutout-y enough.I still stick by what I originally sad, though. While its great that Root Double strives to give players something more than the standard visual novel experience, theres still something to be said for economy and brevity. I feel like theres a middle ground between nothing but clichs for a less than ten hours, and requiring 60+ hours to tell a full story, you know? With a good editor, Root Double probably couldve been great. As it stands, its more the kind of visual novel that youve really got to be willing to commit to.", "date": "April 19, 2018", "grade": "B"}
