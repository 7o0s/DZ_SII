{"name": "Muv-Luv Alternative", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/10/muv-luv-alternative-review-for-ps-vita-pc/", "text": "As the final entry in the Muv-Luv trilogy, Muv-Luv Alternative has quite the reputation. Not only is it part of a trilogy that, according to some, is the pinnacle of achievement in the visual novel genre, some consider this game  which was originally released in Japan in 2006  to be the best part of the trilogy. So if youre going in expecting the worldwell, youd have every reason to do so.I should admit up front that, while I kind of liked the first two games in the series, they didnt blow me away as much as they have others. In particular, the first game, Muv-Luv Extra, seemed like a relic from another time, as you could literally watch all the terrible tropes that have dragged down visual novels over the years getting their start right before your eyes. The second game, Muv-Luv Unlimited, was significantly better, in large part because it traded in its focus on romance for a bit of sci-fi.The good news about Muv-Luv Alternative is that it continues on this track. It has some romantic elements, to be sure, but at its core, its a story of a guy, Takeru Shirogane, trying to save the world. It builds on the already-grandiose plot of the second game and sends it into overdrive, starting in a world where Takeru has been sent back in time to the beginning of the second game, going through some of the same events (with the twist that Takeru is aware that hes reliving the past with the opportunity to change the future), and then rocketing on from there.Its a lot  which, quite frankly, is both good and bad news. The good part is that Muv-Luv Alternative doesnt skimp on anything. If you had any lingering questions about how the characters from the first two games wind up, youre sure to have them answered here. Not only that, because its got such an abundance of plot, youll never going to feel shortchanged.Mind you, thats kind of the bad news, too. Muv-Luv Alternative occasionally seems to forget that editing is a critical part of any good story. All told, going through everything here will take you about fifty hours, which is kind of insane. Im a pretty avid reader, and Im struggling to think of any novels  visual or otherwise  that have enough plot to carry a reader through fifty hours. I appreciate that Muv-Luv Alternatives creators had a lot to say, and had all kinds of twists and turns they wanted to cram in, but at a certain point, a lot starts feeling like too much  and Id be hard-pressed to argue that this game doesnt cross that line.Obviously, the fact that this game is held in such high regard shows that plenty of people would disagree with that assessment. And, quite honestly, I wouldnt discount those opinions: if you loved the first two parts of the Muv-Luv trilogy, then Muv-Luv Alternative is pretty much guaranteed to round out your experience with a bang.", "date": "October 2, 2018", "grade": "B"}
