{"name": "Football Manager Classic 2014", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/05/football-manager-classic-2014-review-ps-vita/", "text": "I love the idea of Football Manager Classic 2014. As I wrote a few weeks ago about OOTP Baseball 15, the concept of a sports management sim you can bring anywhere is incredibly appealing. Any time I get a sports game, regardless of what sport it is, I always sink hours and hours into building up my team, scouting prospects and setting line-ups and doing all that fun/nerdy stuff. The ability to take that with me on the go, rather than have it strictly restricted to my couch, is pretty enticing.When it comes to the actual execution of FMC 2014, however, I have to admit that my love remains more in the theoretical realm than reality. Or, to be more blunt: great concept, not-so-great execution. To some extent, Ill admit, the fact I dont love FMC 2014 can be blamed partly on my own ignorance of soccer. This is a game aimed squarely at people who understand every aspect of the beautiful game on an international level, and who dont need their hands held to get up to speed. I couldnt tell you the first thing of how transfer rules or loans work, and this game makes no effort to tell you. It mentions that things need to be done in passing, and then youre mostly on your own in figuring out how to do those things. The in-game manual doesnt tell you much, and there arent any tutorials for new players. For the most part, its all trial-and-error, with a heavy emphasis on the error. For someone whose primary experience with soccer has come through the FIFA series, FMC is sort of like jumping from a first-year university class straight into a doctoral program.Even if youre going into FMC 2014 with your eyes wide open as to how the game works, however, I suspect that you wont get as much out of the handheld version as you do out of the PC one. This comes down almost entirely to an unwieldy UI; FMC is a game with a tonne of text and a whole lot of options, and navigating around from one screen to the next is a lot harder with touch controls and limited space than it is on a computer manager. To go back to that OOTP comparison, its unfortunate that FMC couldnt have looked at how those developers shrank their game down to fit on iDevices for iOOTP, and adjusted things accordingly.That said, I hate to fault Sports Interactive for being too ambitious. They promised users that theyd bring the full FMC experience to the Vita, and even without having played the game on PC, I get the sense they delivered on this promise. As I said before, I dont know much about soccer, but I was still impressed by the depth this game offers, and at a time when most games seem to guide you every step of the way, its kind of fun  albeit in a very nerdy way  to be thrown into the deep end and left to your own devices.", "date": "May 21, 2014", "grade": "B-"}
