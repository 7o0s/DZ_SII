My appreciation of visual novels (and visual novel-like games) has generally been pretty tepid at best, but Danganronpa twisted the usual formula and added its own little homicidal flourishes just enough that I found its insane charms impossible to resist.And yet, somehow, I liked Danganronpa Another Episode more than either of those other two games  and quite possibly more than both of them combined, if Im being completely honest.Much of this comes down to personal taste. Where those first two Danganronpa games were all about interacting with your classmates and weird show trials that eliminated said classmates one by one, Danganronpa Another Episode is a relatively straightforward third person shooter. The guns are a little different, in that they fire data rather than bullets, but the principle is more or less the same: youre under assault from enemies and you have to shoot your way out. When things get really hectic, you can switch characters and slice them up with scissor blades. Seeing as Ill take blasting my way through bad guys and hacking and slashing my way to freedom over courtroom and personal dramas any day, it should come as little surprise that this new direction speaks to me a lot more.That said, I feel like the franchise benefits from this more streamlined approach. Those first two Danganronpa games had well over a dozen major characters, which meant that a) it took some effort to remember your interactions with all of them, and b) they often resorted to stereotypes in place of actual personalities. By having fewer characters, Danganronpa Another Episode is able to round them out a little more. Were still not talking about incredible depth, obviously, but its a noticeable difference, and it makes the story more interesting in the process.The same thing applies to the graphics. Most of the time, the improvement over previous Danganronpa games is fairly marginal  it looks a little better, sure, but not to an incredible extent. In the cutscenes, though, its a different story. In those, the game takes on a weirdly shiny, semi-realistic look that doesnt look like anything else Ive ever seen, and it really sets Another Episode apart.", "date": "September 14, 2015", "grade": "A"}
