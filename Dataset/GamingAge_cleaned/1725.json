{"name": "Super Time Force", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/05/super-time-force-review-xbox-one-xbla/", "text": "At first glance you might dismiss Super Time Force as another 2D indie action/platformer, something thats not in short supply on various platforms. But in Capybara we trust, and that talented development team has created a very unique, addictive, and oftentimes difficult experience thats not easily comparable to anything Ive ever played before. This is a gorgeously rendered, beautifully animated, entertaining romp through alternate timelines across the future, past and present.At the onset of the game, youll take on the role of one of three members of Super Time Force, a time traveling crew of do-gooders that are out to correct past wrongs and undo future travesties. The introductory stage serves as a much-needed tutorial, displaying the various time-manipulating mechanics that will see you through the end of the wildly themed worlds experienced within.While the core concept here is traditional 2D run-and-gun action, controlling time is certainly the most important tool at your disposal. At any point during the game you can pause time, and rewind back through the entire stage. This allows you to pinpoint a specific area where more firepower would be useful, where you can then drop in another character to play while the ghost of your previous user-controlled character still exists. This function becomes useful in a number of places, notably on boss fights with high armor and multiple weak-points to exploit.Time manipulation is also useful for preventing death, which youll encounter a lot in Super Time Force. Its not unusual to stumble blindly into a new area of a stage and encounter immediate enemy fire, but with the time rewind ability, you can plan and adjust your attacks accordingly. If you manage to get killed, rewind time, and then save your previous ghost, youll be able to merge both characters into one. This bumps up the number of hits your character can sustain, and adds additional firepower to your somewhat meager arsenal of attacks.Both of these these concepts are used frequently to surpass most of the challenges seen in any given stage. Super Time Force is tough as hell to complete, even with time manipulation and stacking multiple characters to increase firepower. Theres a time limit on every stage, so not only do you need to overcome tough bosses and occasionally cheap deaths, youll need to do so quickly. Essentially youll end up replaying stages over and over again, by rewinding time, improving as you begin to learn more about what surprises are in store just off-screen.Theres a feeling that I had while playing which felt very similar to something like Dark Souls, in that this is a game that youre not meant to breeze through, instead you need to learn and replay sections over and over again in order to just squeeze through tough sections. Its a very rewarding experience to master an insane section of a stage or an annoyingly aggravating boss encounter, a feeling that few games are able to deliver as well as Super Time Force does.That said, it can take some getting used to. I struggled a lot early on with the time manipulation, often wanting to go as far as possible without using ghosts or rewinding time to surpass tough sections of the game. Because of this I often felt like I was beating my head against a wall, trying to play in a traditional manner, and not treating the experience more slowly. Granted, its hard to look at the game and not think that this is going to be a twitch/reflex based experience. But once you start to use the rewind time function liberally, even when it doesnt seem necessary, youll start to have a lot more fun with Super Time Force.", "date": "May 20, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
