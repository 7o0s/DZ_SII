{"name": "Kerbal Space Program", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/08/kerbal-space-program-review-ps4/", "text": "By all accounts, Kerbal Space Program on PC is a must-play, a game that manages to take literal rocket science and make it fun and accessible even for those people who arent necessarily scientifically-inclined.That description, unfortunately, does not apply to the PS4 version. Its about as far from accessible as you can possibly get, which means, in turn, thats its not particularly fun. The thing is, I cant tell if my displeasure with the game is because Im not smart enough to play it, or because its a lousy port.Theres no reason why it cant be both of those things, of course. Kerbal Space Program may essentially be rocket science for (kinda) dummies, but it still expects you to do a whole lot of reading and practicing in order for you to understand what youre doing. This, after all, is a game where youre building a space program from the ground up, doing everything from putting together the components in the right order as you build your ships, to launching them and getting them into orbit, to carrying out missions and tasks whilst in space, to safely guiding your astronauts back home. You need to balance your ship correctly, you need to make sure it burns fuel at just the right rate, you need to regularly correct your pitch and your yaw, you need to know when to decouple each stage; at each and every stage, there are countless things that can go wrong, and unless youre thinking very carefully and paying very close attention, odds are good at least one of those things will go wrong  which, really, is just another way of saying you (or at least your ship) will literally crash and burn.The only way to avoid is to take your time, plan things out, and, above all else, do the tutorials. As far as Im concerned, however, its that last part  in the tutorials  where the line begins to blur between Wow, Im bad at this and this is a poorly-planned port job.See, its very clear that Kerbal Space Program was designed with a keyboard, mouse, and computer screen in mind. It demands a great deal of precision, and it gives you dizzying amounts of information, much of it conveyed through little buttons and dials. On both fronts, the problems are evident from the get-go. Its much easier to be precise with a keyboard-mouse combo than it is with a controller, which will become painfully apparent to anyone trying to place thrusters and boosters and rockets just so. You can zoom in to an extent, but even that means relying on an incredibly finnicky camera. Im sure there are people who can handle it, but even then I imagine its the kind of thing youll grudgingly tolerate, rather than something that becomes second nature.Likewise, all that information is conveyed in one of two ways: either in a font so small youll be straining your eyes to figure out what it says, or  assuming you fiddle around with the UI settings in the controls  in boxes so large that they make it almost impossible to see everything you need to see. On a smaller computer screen this may be easier on the eyes, but here its just frustrating.I should also note that, for all my complaints, the games performance wasnt too much of an issue. It never crashed, nor did I experience the pain of losing all my progress. In this, unfortunately, my experience may have been atypical, as numerous people have found that  perhaps because of the sheer volume of information being processed  game-breaking bugs tend to pop up at the worst possible time.", "date": "August 22, 2016", "grade": "C-"}
