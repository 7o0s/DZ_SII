{"name": "Futuridium EP Deluxe", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/10/futuridium-ep-deluxe-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "To some extent, Futuridium EP Deluxe is cut from the same cloth as TxK from earlier this year. It, too, is a space-shooter thats very, very heavily indebted to some of the earliest video games. Its got relatively simple graphics and gameplay, and it wouldnt be too hard to imagine playing it on an old school arcade cabinet.At the same time, though, theres something undeniably modern about Futuridium. Part of it is the graphics; as retro as they may be, if you look closely youll see little flourishes  things like intentional ghosting of the little squares youre blasting  that separate them from the straight lines and angles of a game like TxK. Likewise, even if the gameplay itself is pretty basic, consisting of nothing more than flying through space and shooting at enemies and cubes, its still got a present-day sensibility as far as its level of difficulty goes. Like a lot of todays retro-inspired games, Futuridium is unforgivingly punishing, and leaves little margin for error. It may only have fifty levels, but theyre fifty of the hardest levels youre likely to come across.And then theres the music. Futuridiums gameplay may have its roots in the 70s and 80s, but its pulsating electronic soundtrack could only have been created now. Its a mixture of drum & bass, breakbeat and electro, and its not at all surprising that it can be consumed separately on a 45-minute soundtrack thats being sold independently of the game. In fact, I wouldnt be at all surprised to discover that the music works even better outside of the game than it does as part of it; here, the beats dont always match up with the music, leading to little moments of audio-visual dissonance.", "date": "October 17, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
