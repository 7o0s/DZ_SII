{"name": "Star Wars Pinball", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/10/star-wars-pinball-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "If there is one property what always works for pinball, its Star Wars. Over the last year, Zen Studios have been releasing Star Wars themed tables through their Pinball FX series on multiple platforms. Today, that vast collection of 19 tables arrives on Nintendo Switch in both digital and physical form! If you havent tried any form of Digital Pinball, nows the time to dive in!With this exclusive collection, you get all 16 previously released tables such as Han Solo, Darth Vader, The Calrissian Chronicles and many others. Plus, you get three brand new tables based on Empire Strikes Back, Boba Fett and The Clone Wars! Just like with Pinball FX3 on the Switch, which I reviewed previously, you can play each table vertically while in handheld mode. To me, this is still the best way to play these tables because its more fun and actually feels like you are holding a mini table in your hands thanks to Zen Studios attention to detail in these releases.A few new features have been added to this collection. You can choose either to earn points for the Light or Dark side in an online community struggle. Playing tables and scoring big bonuses will add to how much power each side holds over the other. This is for everyone who registers their account with the leader boards and, as more people play, the struggle for total control will become more intense. We also get new Career Mode will allow you to join the Jedi or the Darkside through 50 different Career Ranks. Playing any table unlocks special Force Power bonuses that can be applied toward bigger scores and bonuses to advance through your flipper career. Both modes seem to work in tandem, so choose your side wisely.If I may use the old saying If it aint broke, dont fix it, this would be the best way to describe the presentation of this collection. All of the fantastic graphic detail and superb control found in Pinball FX3 can be found here. You can always expect a fantastic presentation with Zen Pinball titles, and this collection is no exception.Zen has stated that there are more tables planned to be released digitally. Since there are more Star Wars movies and TV shows in the pipeline, we will not be experiencing a shortage of new tables for quite some time. Even if you do manage to play every single one of these tables contained here, you will want to go back and try to improve your score on all of them.$29.99 is a great price for this level of digital pinball perfection. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking this collection up. Im looking forward to what Zen Studios is cooking up next!", "date": "October 17, 2019", "grade": "A"}
