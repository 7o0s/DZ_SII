The entire game consists of you going around a massive island, doing chores for people.In the wrong hands, that could make for an abysmal experience. I still fight the urge to yawn every time I think of Planet 51 for PS3, a game so incredibly boring it literally made me fall asleep. Given that much of Yonders gameplay consists of Gather X number of resources, bring to to Person Y, I wouldnt have been surprised if it suffered  or, at least, made me suffer  the same fate.But heres the thing: I love it. Im addicted to it. Theres just something delightfully soothing about exploring a massive, beautiful, peaceful island on foot, doing nothing more than fulfilling requests for the various people you come across.I mean, there is a story somewhere inside Yonder  something to do with the eponymous cloud catcher, and the main characters search for his/her family. And you do need to hunt down sprites to help you clear the island of shadows; not doing that will hinder your ability to advance too far in the game. But, in all honesty, finishing up the story often seems more like a happy by-product of finishing quests, rather than something you need to be doing.As for the quests themselves, theyre nothing too special. Like I said, its mostly gathering certain numbers of resources to help people build things. You also need to build up your farm  a task that, rather delightfully, involves feeding some of the most adorable animals imaginable and luring them back to your plot of land.Even more of Yonders joy comes from the simple act of uncovering new quests. The island on which the game takes place is huge, includes a number of different ecosystems, and features dynamic weather and a fast-moving clock. Theres something almost magical about starting the day on a sunny beach, making your way through lush meadows during a rainstorm, and ending up in the midst of snow-peaked mountains. Admittedly, there are points where you kind of wish there were some faster way of getting around that just walking, but taken as a whole, its not all that bad.", "date": "September 21, 2017", "grade": "A"}
