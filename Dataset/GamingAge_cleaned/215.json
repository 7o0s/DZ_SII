{"name": "Block-a-Pix Deluxe", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/04/block-a-pix-deluxe-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "As much as I enjoy Lightwood Games Pic-a-Pix games  and I certainly enjoy them a whole lot, perhaps to an unhealthy degree  I have to confess that going into Block-a-Pix Deluxe I was feeling a little fatigued by the whole picross formula. While Pic-a-Pix Classic and Pic-a-Pix Pieces differed a little from last years Pic-a-Pix Color, on the whole they were still basically the same  and playing them obsessively across multiple platforms probably didnt help.You can imagine how pleased I was to discover that Block-a-Pix Deluxe changes things up a little. While youre still filling in a grid to reveal a picture, Block-a-Pix owes at least as much of a debt to Minesweeper and jigsaw puzzles as it does to picross games. Rather than figuring out patterns based on the X-Y axes, here numbers are placed around the board and you have to figure how to place quadrilaterals of various sizes that touch each number. Each board plays around with the associated colours, and you eventually reveal some neat-looking pixelated pictures. Is it as hard as the Pic-a-Pix games? Not reallybut it also is. On the one hand, it requires far less logic. Youre not keeping track of how to fit everything in along the horizontal and vertical lines. At the same time, though, its challenging in the same way that a jigsaw puzzle is challenging: sure, its pretty easy at first when youre only talking about small puzzles, but as the grids get larger and larger, you eventually reach a point where the puzzles can take you a pretty solid chunk of time to complete.This, Ill admit, is the one area where I have a bit of a problem with Block-a-Pix Deluxe. When the puzzles reach a certain size, it becomes a bit of a challenge  and not in a good way  to navigate the grid. I wouldnt say that it negated my enjoyment of the game or anything, but it did lead to the occasional moment of frustration. On the whole, though, that frustration pales in comparison to the overall pleasure I got from the game. The year is still early, but I have no doubt that whenever my PlayStation 2019 Year in Review comes out, Ill find that  much like Pic-a-Pix Colours last year  Block-a-Pix Deluxe is going to be right up near the top of my list in terms of how much time I spent playing it. Its not groundbreaking, but its a lot of fun, and thats all that matters to me.", "date": "April 16, 2019", "grade": "A"}
