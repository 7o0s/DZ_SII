{"name": "The Park", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/06/park-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "When I think of games like Gone Home, Firewatch, and Everybodys Gone to the Rapture, I think of a few things. I think of great, interesting narratives. I think of complex emotional themes. I think of richly imagined worlds. I think of tones that are both slightly unsettling but also utterly engrossing. In the case of the latter two, I think of gorgeous graphics. Basically, when I think of those three titles. I think of games for which I have a deep and abiding affection.And when I think of The Park, I think of none of those things.The only thing they have in common, really, is that they all fall under the umbrella of walking simulators. And while Im not crazy about that term when it comes to those other games  I find it far too needlessly reductive, and usually accompanied by sneering judgments on what is and isnt a game  it pretty much applies perfectly to The Park. After all, the entire game essentially consists of you going from Point A to Point B, picking up narrative device X that furthers the plot along the way. Theres no room for exploration, and no room for meaningful interaction. You just walk in a straight line until the end credits roll.On the upside, I guess, you can do it all in one sitting. The Park clocks in at well under two hours  significantly less if you run rather than walk  which means that however horrible it may be, you at least dont have to spend too much time with it.I still contend, however, that even 90 to 120 minutes is too much to devote to this junk. Your time would be better spent playing almost literally anything else. All you get here is an ugly, incomprehensible mess that tries  and fails  to scare you into believing that youve just experienced something other than that.The main problem, I suspect, is that not even The Parks developers knew what they were aiming for when they created their game. They couldnt seem to decide whether they wanted to make it something about one womans drug- and mental illness-fueled descent into madness, or a scary story about a haunted, murder-inducing theme park. In the end, they opted to split the difference and go for both, leading to a story that doesnt make a whole lot of sense, and isnt all that engaging to begin with. It doesnt help matters much that the main character  really, the only character here  isnt particularly interesting, so you never really have much reason to care what happens to her.Nor does it help that the game  to be blunt  thoroughly sucks in the visual department. The few glimpses you get of the main character make her look like a barely-human monstrosity; Id say that she gets caught in the uncanny valley, but the reality is she doesnt come anywhere close to looking like a real human being. Seeing as shes supposed to, thats a bad thing. The world in which the game takes place isnt that much better. Seeing as The Parks events take place at night, there should be a built-in reason for everything looking dark and shadowy, but somehow, the way everything is designed, it just looks dulled and half-sketched. To top things off, youre expected to learn the games story by reading letters and notes scattered throughout the titular park, except the writing is tiny and theres no way to zoom in or have it read, which means it takes real effort to figure out whats on the screen.", "date": "June 24, 2016", "grade": "D-"}
