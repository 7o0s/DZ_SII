{"name": "Windscape", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/09/windscape-review-for-nintendo-switch-xbox-one/", "text": "Even though Ive never been able to get into The Legend of Zelda, Ive long had a weird weakness for Zelda-like games. I adored Oceanhorn, and I loved Yonder so much, I reviewed it twice.So youd think that a game like Windscape would be right up my alley, right? I mean, its first-person, which puts it a little closer to, say, Skyrim than to Zelda, but between the cartoon-y art style and the focus on adventure and quests over gritty fantasy means its not too far from what youd get from a game featuring Link & co.The problem is, Windscape just isnt very good, nor is it particularly interesting. Also, its incredibly ugly.Lets start with the looks. Or, I suppose, the lack thereof, because, as I just said, this game isnt very nice to look at. Basically, imagine Wind Waker, but designed by someone with not much in the way of talent, and drawn by someone who only had a vague idea of what people look like. At best, the characters here look vaguely human, if weirdly lacking in features. More often, they look humanoid, in that theyre shaped kind of like humans, only horribly wrong. This is kind of acceptable, since its a fantasy game, but that doesnt make some of the creatures here any less disturbing to look at.This might be easier to take if the gameplay itself was something special. Instead, its essentially a series of fetch quests, punctuated by combat that could be charitably described as uninspired. You walk around the world, and whenever you encounter an enemy, you just keep whacking it until it vanishes. You can craft your weapon so its a little stronger, and you occasionally face off against bosses which require even more whacking than usual, but almost everything youll do in this game is revealed in the first couple of minutes, when your parents send you off to deliver something and you encounter some agree bees (whack, whack, whack) and goat-like creatures (whack, whack, whack) along the way.I hate being too negative about Windscape, since its not like it was designed by a huge team or anything. Its the work of some people who, I assume, wanted to make their own Skyrim or Zelda, and theres nothing wrong with shooting so high. The thing is, as I said up top, there are other indie games that have aimed for that too, and theyve shown that its quite possible to emulate the spirit of Skyrim and Zelda without having anything close to their budgets. So when I say that Windscape falls short, I mean that it falls short of the likes of Yonder and Oceanhorn too. Given that those games exist, youre much better off playing them than even thinking about this.", "date": "September 4, 2019", "grade": "C-"}
