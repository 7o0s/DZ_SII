{"name": "ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/12/ark-ultimate-survivor-edition-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition is playable on the Switch.That may not seem like much, but when you consider the state in which ARK: Survival Evolved arrived on the Switch back in 2018, thats actually a huge accomplishment. The original version of this game was essentially unplayable. It looked terrible, it was completely unbalanced, it had absurdly long load times, and it looked really, really terrible  and Im repeating that last point twice for emphasis, since I still dont think Ive seen anything that matches the original port in terms of being hideously ugly. That Grove Street Games were able to take that garbage and turn it into a port that works is pretty incredible. (Side note: Grove Street Games also worked on last years absurdly bad GTA trilogy port, so this makes ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition doubly redemptive  not only does it show that the game isnt half bad, it also shows that the developers arent anywhere near as bad as their previous work might have led you to believe.)Whats more, theyve turned ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition into a game thats actually fairly nice-looking. While there are definitely games that look better, its clearly moved to a point where its no longer the clear winner for ugliest game on the Switch. Likewise, the load times are no longer unbearable. When you die  and you will die, quite frequently  you no longer have to sit around and wait forever for the game to respawn you. Again, its not a seamless process, but its no longer at a point where the game is barely functional, And now that ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition works, I can say this: Im terrible at it. My characters die constantly, and not just from dinosaur attacks. They drown, they freeze, they accidentally kill themselves from punching trees and rocks. If theres a way to die in this game, odds are good that fate has befallen one of my creations.But thats the point of the game. It has Survival (or, in the newer versions case, Survivor) right there in the title. This is a game about learning how to survive in the most absurdly hostile environment imaginable, and now that it actually works, its able to deliver on that promise. Mind you, that means that theres another complaint to be leveled against ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition: that its almost impenetrably difficult. To say it doesnt hold your hand would be an understatement. Rather, it only gives you the barest outline of what you can do, and expects you to figure out the rest. There are a few pages of text that give you a rough idea of what you need to do, but if you want anything more than that, you need to puzzle it out yourself. As someone whos not great at survival games at the best of times, this made ARK seem punitive  rather than simply punishing  in its difficulty.But honestly, thats a me problem, not a problem with the game. And seeing as a few years ago, ARK wasnt even functional on the Switch, the fact that theyve gotten it to a point where its possible to separate out personal issues with the game from broader issues that everyone will have is pretty impressive. ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition still isnt a game for everyone, but at least now it can be said its a game that some people might enjoy.", "date": "December 30, 2022", "grade": "B"}
