{"name": "Hitman: Sniper Assassin", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/06/hitman-sniper-assassin-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "Strange as it may sound, 2016s Hitman helped me get through a difficult time in life last year. Consequently, a) it will forever be one of my all-time favourite games, and b) when Warner Bros. Interactive announced late last week that Hitman 2 would be out by the end of the year, it instantly rocketed to Most Anticipated Game status for me.At the same time as they announced Hitman 2, Warner Bros. also released Hitman: Sniper Assassin as a teaser/pre-order enticement for the upcoming game. And, for the most part, it does a pretty good job of keeping my excitement levels high.I mean, it would be hard for the game (mini-game?) not to succeed, seeing as its a 15-minute taste of things to come, which seems like the kind of thing IO Interactive would be able to churn out in their collective sleep. Nonetheless, it fills this role admirably, giving you three distinct targets, a small-ish location with all kinds of environmental hazards and hiding places, and plenty of bodyguards and innocent passersby with annoying tendencies to investigate and raise the alarm when, say, random bullets go whizzing by their heads or they stumble across a dead body.That said, its clearly not the full Hitman experience. Youre just playing as a sniper, meaning you dont get to interact with the world the same way you would in a normal Hitman game. Theres no knocking people out and stealing their clothes, nor do you really get to experience all the little quirks that these worlds usually have to offer. Plus, its not exactly a set-up that lends itself to brute-forcing your way through a level (by which I mean killing everyone indiscriminately, running away, and hiding until the heat level goes down and its safe for you to steal someone elses clothes)  which, I have to admit, is usually my go-to playing style.Still, its undeniably a lot of fun. Its impossible to say based on these fifteen minutes whether Hitman 2 will be as good as its predecessor, but Hitman: Sniper Assassin at least makes it quite clear that itll be worth watching to find.", "date": "June 13, 2018", "grade": "A"}
