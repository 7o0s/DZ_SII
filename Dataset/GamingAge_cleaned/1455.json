{"name": "2013: Infected Wars", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/04/2013-infected-wars-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Ill be frank: 2013: Infected Wars is a pretty bad game. If youre looking for a hidden Vita gem, keep on looking, because its pretty much the polar opposite of that. By virtually any measure you can imagine, its not very good.And yetI kind of like it.Dont get me wrong, Im not about to suggest its worth buying if your choice is between this and almost any other game. Its really only worth picking up if youre a dedicated Vita completist like me, or if your Vita has a third person shooter-shaped whole in it (also like me) or if you just have an affinity for terrible games (again, like me). Basically, 2013: Infected Wars is the perfect game for me and almost no one else. For the most part, people are going to look at 2013 and see only the bad  and really, they wont have to look very hard.Its important to note that, to an extent, 2013 is bad by design. This much should be evident from the name; it was a little dumb when the game first came out in its titular year, and its still dumb today. As if the heavy-handed humour wasnt obvious enough from the fact the game is called 2013: Infected Wars, it gets driven home by a voiceover that explains how al-Qaeda caused a zombie apocalypse with a dirty bomb in  you guessed it  2013. The intentional badness is rounded out by other voiceovers throughout the game that sound like they were shouted through a tin can and a piece of string.Its clear, though, that 2013 isnt just intentionally or ironically bad  its just straight up bad, too. That much is obvious from the graphics, which look straight out of the PS2 era  assuming they were subsequently filtered through an older model iPhone, too. Its obvious from the way the characters move; whether its the way your main character seems to stumble sideways through each level, or the fact all the zombies seem to seem to fly backwards like stiff plywood when they get shot, theres nothing remotely natural or fluid about any character movements here.Really, its obvious in every aspect of the game: the fact all the weapons have the same impacts, even if their respective strengths are clearly different. The lousy aiming, which makes it impossible to tell whether a shot is going to blast a zombies brains out or glance off their arms leaving nothing more than a flesh wound. The way thatwell, you probably get my point. Any way 2013 could be bad, it is.So why do I still like it? For most of the reasons enumerated above. Because I like playing bad games. Because Im a fan of third-person shooters, even if theyre terrible. Because it allows me to play a mediocre (at best) iOS shooter with buttons instead of touch controls, which  I have to admit  was a big part of why I switched from gaming on my phone to buying a PSP around five years ago.", "date": "April 16, 2015", "grade": "C"}
