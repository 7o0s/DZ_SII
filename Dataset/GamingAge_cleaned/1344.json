{"name": "Final Fantasy VII iOS", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/final-fantasy-vii-ios-review/", "text": "Im willing to be that most of you are pretty familiar with Final Fantasy VII at this point. Originally released on PS1 back in 1997, and going on to make what I assume is a kajillion dollars, its a pretty popular RPG that most us who grew up in that era have played. And Id venture to say that most who grew up after that era have played it too, with a few different opportunities to do so across platforms like Steam, PSP, Vita, and PS3. So chances are you if youve ever had any interest in playing Final Fantasy VII, youve found a way to do so at this point.But, I still think its a pretty neat thing to have available on iOS. And its not that weve never had Final Fantasy VII on a portable platform before, but being able to boot the game up while laying in bed using my iPad is just sort of neat to me. It looks pretty good, with some cleaned up character models that are still polygonal as hell, but look a bit sharper than the PS1 emulation available on Vita and PSP. The pre-rendered backgrounds dont hold up quite as well, as you can likely imagine, coming off a bit fuzzy compared to the monsters and characters.All the menus and text boxes look sharp, with easy to read font on either a phone or tablet, showing that Square Enix at least put some effort into making this port work on a variety of screen sizes. And despite not being as ideal as a controller, I generally found the touch controls worked fine throughout. My only real complaint with this version of the game is that Id have loved the ability to simply tap menu commands, especially in battle. As it currently stands, youre given a virtual D-Pad for menu controls, with a large set of face buttons on the right hand side of the screen. Since the controls overlay in an opaque fashion, sometimes across the menus, by default you just want to tap a menu option before realizing that doesnt work. It takes some adjusting to, but eventually it doesnt feel awkward.", "date": "August 31, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
