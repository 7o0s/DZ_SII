{"name": "Velocity Ultra", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/velocity-ultra-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Velocity Ultra got its start as a PS Mini called Velocity, so its not too surprising that the game is a little bite-sized: lots of short missions, relatively basic controls, rudimentary cut scenes. Basically, its the kind of game that wouldnt have existed, say, six years ago, before Apples App Store showed that there was a (rather lucrative) market for them.Of course, the App Store also showed that size didnt really matter, and that tiny little handheld games could be just as fun as triple-A ones. This is a truth thats reinforced by Velocity Ultra. All those bite-sized aspects that I mentioned last paragraph make it well-suited to both longer gaming sessions and quick gaming breaks alike.Take the short missions, for example. Most of them can be breezed through in just a few minutes, perfect for when you just want to kill a few minutes during a commute or between classes. At the same time, however, theyre structured in such a way that its very, very easy to sink massive amounts of time into them  youve got online leaderboards, youve got gold/silver/bronze stars, and, most importantly, theres the constant sense of Hey, that last one didnt take too long, I can squeeze in one more! Just speaking from personal experience, I regularly found that one mission would turn into five missions would turn into eight to ten missions, and next thing I knew it would be an hour or two later.In fact, everything about the game strikes this balance between casual and hardcore. The story: told via colorful, comic-style graphics, but basic enough (essentially, kill the aliens and save the survivors) that you can put the game down and come back to it without feeling like youve completely lost the plot. The controls: easy to pick up (Velocity Ultra is, at its core, a shmup, so most of the game is flying forward and shooting aliens), but difficult to really master until youve played at least a couple of times.And the musicoh, the music. Theres a reason FuturLab can get away with selling the soundtrack separately on iTunes. Its fantastic, a neat mixture of old-school video games and modern-day dance party. Couple that with the bright graphics, and youve got a real feast for the senses.", "date": "July 15, 2013", "grade": "A"}
