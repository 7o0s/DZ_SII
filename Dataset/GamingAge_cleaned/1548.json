{"name": "Tennis In The Face", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/12/tennis-face-review-ps4/", "text": "For a developer that basically has zero originality, 10tons make some pretty enjoyable games. King Oddball, Sparkle, Sparkle 2: they may borrow (to put it charitably) ideas from other, more popular games, but theyre easily some of the most enjoyable that Ive played this year.As youve probably guessed, you can add Tennis in the Face to that list. Like those games, its premise is simple. Its a physics-based casual game where you fire projectiles  in this case tennis balls, along with the odd explosive  at various enemies scattered throughout levels. And thats it. There are different types of enemies, and occasionally slightly different environmental hazards that you need to plan around, but essentially, once youve played one level, youve gotten a pretty complete idea of whats in store for the next hundred or so levels.In other words, its Angry Birds with tennis balls. But just like Rovios money-maker, Tennis in the Face is super-addictive. Theres just enough change and just enough incremental increases in difficulty from level to level that you feel compelled to keep going  and, of course, the drive to beat your high score (both locally and on the leaderboards) doesnt hurt either.Obviously, you need to dock a few points from Tennis in the Face for not coming up with a unique idea so much as it simply adds a bit of a twist to an already wildly popular franchise. But I dont want to take away too much from it  partly because that twist (where the enemies are clowns, business people, cops and others trying to get their Explodz energy drink) is cutely funny, and partly because, whatever it may be lacking in originality, its still really fun.", "date": "December 23, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
