{"name": "Assassins Creed Unity", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/11/assassins-creed-unity-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "Assassins Creed Unity comes hot on the heels of last years excellent Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag. Dropping the swashbuckling for some good old fashioned revolution, Unity puts players in control of Arno Dorian, navigating the turbulent roads and back alleys of late 1700s Paris, France, in the build-up and execution of the French Revolution. While the setting certainly has the potential for some interesting conflict, theres a number of things that make this iteration of Assassins Creed underwhelming.This is very much a traditional Assassins Creed experience. Single-player focused, with competitive multiplayer removed in favor of 4-player co-op missions. As Arno, youll run through sequence after sequence, propelling forward weeks and months at a time. Youll start off as a young boy who loses his father, transition into a lovable, care-free rogue, and eventually become a battle-wearied, wisened Assassins. Theres some small twists on this well-tread formula, the subtitle of Unity certainly plays a part. But by and large youll find the broad strokes of Unitys plot covers a lot previously charted territory for the series.Theres also, as you might expect, some real-world development by way of a handful of cutscenes featuring Abstergo, Templars, Assassins and so on. However, as the final credits woefully reveal, much of that is inconsequential. Im assuming the reason there was no number attached to the tail end of the title is because this was meant to be a side-story as opposed to an important entry lore-wise. But when you see the final reveal, youll be left wondering why this entry was even necessary, as it doesnt appear to advance the overall plot of the series one bit.While the majority of time spent playing Unity will see you climbing up and down high structures, dropping from above for air assassinations, tailing enemies just out of sight, and tracking down what feels like thousands of different collectibles, theres a few core changes worth mentioning. The parkour traversal system the series is so well-known for has changed a bit. Theres more of an emphasis on making it easier to climb and descend objects. Youll still hold in the right trigger to initiate flat-out runs, but youll find yourself getting a little less frustrated when climbing with the A and B or X and O buttons. Descending, in particular, feels much improved, making it easier to either hold down B or tap B when climbing down. Youre certainly less likely to fall or unexpectedly leap from high heights to your death, which is a definite plus.But Unity also seems to have a number of technical issues. Theres certain city sections that bog down the framerate, youll see frequent enough pop-in for the larger crowds Unitys streets contain, and a number of other bugs seem pretty persistent. Unity hardlocked my Xbox One on more than one occasion, and Ive had scripted events bug out in a way that required me to force Arno to his death, or restart the mission checkpoint. Checkpointing is frequent enough that this didnt cause a huge issue, but the load times on the Xbox One version of Unity can feel downright ridiculous. It takes between 40 to 50 seconds to load into the game world from a fresh start screen, and around 20 seconds or so when using fast travel or restarting from death. Ive even had cutscene loading cause stalls or force game restarts, enough so that Ive started to subconsciously cross my fingers when I see the loading screen animation begin. And this is with the 900mb day one patch installed. Id be scared to see how Unity performed prior to that patch.Assassins Creed Unitys approach to combat and stealth seems largely unchanged. Combat flows a bit differently, and in my opinion, was a bit tougher than I remember. Enemies are more likely to parry or deflect attacks, and can be pretty aggressive at full alert. In previous AC titles I generally felt like I could hold my own against larger groups, but in Unity Id start to get into trouble with four or more. This in turn caused me to rely heavily on tools like Smoke Bombs and other familiar items.Stealth is generally worthwhile and easy enough to perform, outside of the occasional geometry hang-ups that can certainly be annoying. Theres not much to the stealth this time around, outside of a simple cover mechanic that only allows you to transition from one piece of cover to the next, with no options to easily round corners on a single piece of cover. However, enemy A.I. is dumb enough that screwing up while attempting to be stealthy is rarely an issue. Theres a lot of leeway for downing foes, even when they stand right next to each other. Sometimes youll see no reaction, which can lead to some unintentionally hilarious scenarios. Even when the panicking crowd nearby should give you away, there might be little to no reaction from enemies.As I mentioned earlier, Unity also loves its collectibles. Thats not necessarily odd for an AC title, but I found myself pretty overwhelmed at the incredible number of map icons unveiled when synchronizing a viewpoint. Theres standard chests, locked chests, chests tied into what I assume is an app companion, chests tied into the Initiates UPlay thing that never worked for me, shops to purchase, hidden symbols to uncover, some other Initiates/app related collectible I never used, and many more. Seriously, it borders on self parody at this point.", "date": "November 11, 2014", "grade": "C"}
