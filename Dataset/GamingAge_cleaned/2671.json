{"name": "Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/04/hero-u-rogue-to-redemption-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "If you want to fully understand Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption  or even if you want an idea of whether youre going to enjoy it  you need to know where its coming from.It was created by Lori and Corey Cole, who rose to prominence about thirty years ago for creating the Quest for Glory games, a series of adventure games that hits back when those games were popular. Hero-U is their first game in more than twenty years, and its based on an idea theyve been working on since 2003  first as a book, then as a text adventure, then as a website, and, finally, as a proper game.In other words, Hero-U may have come out this year, but everything about it  except, possibly, the graphics  feels like its come straight out of a game from a couple of decades ago.I dont say that with any kind of judgment. (Okay, maybe with a bit of judgment, which Ill get to in a moment.) Rather, its a statement of fact. The constant wordplay and puns and fourth-wall-breaking seems like its come straight from the early 90s, and brings to mind Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle and all kinds of other games of which Im only vaguely aware.On top of that, the gameplay feels not very far removed from the point and click adventures of a few decades ago. You click on almost literally every object, you exhaust all your options, and occasionally you come across something useful  and, of course, most of the time your actions are accompanied by more of those puns and wordplay.Just about the only thing in Hero-U that wouldnt have fit in thirty years ago is the graphics  though thats not because the game is a graphical powerhouse or anything, but rather because it wouldve been challenging for computers to display 3D graphics like this.Because Hero-U feels so heavily indebted to a particular moment in gaming history, its really hard to fully enjoy the game unless you lived in that particular moment (or, I guess, if you somehow developed an appreciation for the genre in the ensuing decades). If the idea of a point-and-click adventure thats heavy on the puns and on the clicking sounds like heaven to you, then youll be in luck with Hero-U, but otherwise, youll probably want to skip this one.", "date": "April 26, 2021", "grade": "B"}
