{"name": "Hotline Miami", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/hotline-miami-review-for-psn-ps-vita/", "text": "A short list of things I hate in gaming:On top of that, I dont usually like drug-fueled art, and I usually cant stand lo-fi music. (Note: these two things are almost certainly related.)In other words, I should probably hate everything about Hotline Miami. Its ridiculously hard, its brutally violent, and it requires meticulous planning every step of the way. It gives you a letter grade at the end of each level. Its 16-bit graphics revel in their grittiness, its music is heavy on the reverb, and the whole thing is drenched in a cokey neon haze.Heres the thing, though: I love Hotline Miami. I love every little aspect of the game, from its difficulty to its gameplay to its atmosphere. I dont know if Id call it my mid-year Game of the Year (thats still Thomas Was Alone), but its most definitely in my Top 3.Oddly enough, I think my love of the game is rooted in some of the things Id normally hate  in the difficulty and the planning. You see, deep down, Hotline Miami is a puzzle game. Look past the blood and the weapons and the masks with their special powers and the woozy-sounding music, and youll find a game that requires you to think through every move carefully, and that expects you to carry out those moves with near-perfect reflexes. And as much as I might hate some aspects of Hotline Miami  or, at least, as much as Id hate them in other contexts  I love puzzle games. It just so happens that in this game, when you cant solve a puzzle, you get your head blown off and you find yourself lying in a pool of blood and brains.Clearly, as that last sentence indicates, Hotline Miami isnt for the faint ofwell, anything. Because make no mistake, this game is extraordinarily violent. The thing is, however, that violence gives a surprising sense urgency to solving each puzzle. Think about it: when you cant solve a puzzle in a Professor Layton game, you get a disappointed look from the Professor or Luke. Here, you get murdered in an absolutely brutal fashion. If thats not motivation, I dont know what is.As for the graphics and the musicagain, in any other context I might hate them. Here, however, both work in the games favour. If Hotline Miami were as violent as it is and it had modern graphics, Im quite sure I wouldnt be able to stomach it. The same goes for the music; divorced from the game, the druggy, hazy atmosphere it creates would probably come off as unbearably pretentious. In the context of a story thats all about weirdness and uncertainty, it works fantastically well.", "date": "July 24, 2013", "grade": "A+"}
