{"name": "Arietta of Spirits", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/01/arietta-of-spirits-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Up until last year, Id never been into top-down RPGs. Like, at all. In 30+ years of gaming, somehow no games like that had ever really spoken to me all that much. Then, out of nowhere, last year I had two games that fit into that broad category  Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion (my personal GOTY) and Nexomon  that were among my most played, and suddenly I was eager to give the whole genre a chance.While I wouldnt say that Arietta of Spirits turned me off the whole genre again, Im sad to report that just because I like some games in the genre doesnt mean I now like all games in the genre.Thats not to say that Arietta of Spirits is a bad game, mind you  its not. Its just that its also not anything special, either. Its basically just a pretty standard top-down RPG in most respects. The combat is fine: you attack with a wooden sword, you dodge some particularly aggressive animals  its nothing you havent seen before. It can be a little annoying at times, since hit detection can be a little tough to master, and you can never quite tell when youre close enough to hit an enemy without being so close that you lose some health in the process, but on the whole, it works exactly as youd expect.Likewise, the visuals are pretty much exactly what youd expect. Its kind of pixel art-y, albeit some some nice, vivid colours, so it pops off the screen a lot more than many, say, KEMCO RPGs that all seem to draw from the exact same colour palette. Again, its pleasant enough, but nothing memorable.Just about the only area where Arietta of Spirits stands out is in its story, but even that has some issues. On the one hand, its a nice story about a girl coming to terms with the death of her grandmother and saving an island that she loves, and its told at just the right pace  long enough you can get into it, but not so long that it overstays its welcome.On the other hand, however, the game has a tendency to overexplain things, or to decide to stop the action dead so it can tell you some more plot. While I wouldnt say this is the worst thing (since, again, its a nice story), it does make it feel like the game lurches along at times, making you stop and start regularly enough that it takes a little away from the flow.But it certainly could have been a lot worse, as these games go. Arietta of Spirits wont wow you like some of the best Zelda-inspired games, but its still got some niceness at its core. That may not make it a classic, but its enough to make it fun enough while it lasts.", "date": "January 25, 2022", "grade": "B"}
