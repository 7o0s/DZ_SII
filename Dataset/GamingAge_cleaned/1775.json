While my knowledge of the genre is (very) far from encyclopedic, Id be willing to wager that its certainly up there. After all, most  your Rock Bands, your Guitar Heroes and whatnot  simply feature notes travelling along a line on the screen, so its not as if theyre that graphically dazzling. Even games that broke the usual mold a little, like Theatrhythm Final Fantasy or Michael Jackson: The Experience, were nothing special. So when you have a game like Hatsune Miku, that basically looks like a cross between an animated concert and a karaoke video, it naturally stands out.Two things about that:First, it would be kind of a big deal if Hatsune Miku f didnt have better-than-usual graphics. Ill confess that I dont fully understand the whole vocaloid thing, but near as I can tell (thanks to Wikipedia, naturally) the games titular character and friends are the anime-ized versions of a singing synthesizer program, and shes so popular in Japan that shes performed live concerts via hologram. As far as Im concerned, anything thats had so much real-world impact and been shown to so many people had darn well better look nice. In other words, it seems to me that being nice-looking is what should be expected in this case, not some added bonus.The other thing isthe more Ive played of the game, the more Ive understood why music and rhythm games dont usually make things visually complex: it can make it awfully hard to follow whats going on. Its hard to screw up following notes when they move along predetermined lines. In Hatsune Mikus case, not only do the notes appear all over the screen moving in different directions, theyre also competing with the on-screen action for your attention. At times, this can make things feel a little too frantic. Some of that, of course, is by design, but at others, it seems like its just poorly planned out.That said, this busy-ness doesnt happen often enough to rate as anything more than a minor  albeit persistent  annoyance. In fact, I have to say that one of the upsides of it is that the game never feels stale. The layer of dust coating my Guitar Hero band set is a testament to the fact that, invariably, every time I played one of those rhythm games Id lose interest as they all started feeling kind of same-y. Here, by contrast, each song has its own distinctive style, which makes it feel like youre doing something new each time, rather than rehashing the same thing over and over again.Of course, the real star of Hatsune Miku: Project Diva f is  as it should be  the music. Even if youre like me, and youve never listened to a note of J-Pop before in your life, youre liable to find the songs here shockingly catchy. You may not always know where the notes on screen are going, but the music itself is so well put together that youre likely to find yourself grooving along (and, consequently, be forced to retry each song multiple times as you try to ignore the catchiness in favor of getting a little further along in the game).", "date": "March 17, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
