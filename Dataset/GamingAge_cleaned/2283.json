There are a whole lot of comparisons to stuff like Angry Birds being bandied about, which it honestly feels pretty close to. But Wreckateer offers a fair amount of challenge and fun for its asking price, and is certainly worth a look for starving Kinect owners out there.The concept is simple enough. Youre a dude tasked with clearing out goblin infested castles for the kingdom, and apparently the only way to do so is to literally lay waste to the entire castle. Apparently its like having bed bugs, but way worse. In order to destroy these various structures, youll have use of a ballista and a variety of ammo types to bring as much stone to the ground as you possibly can.Of course, just destroying castles might not be that exciting, so theres a whole score chasing factor in place, requiring a bronze medal to be earned in order to proceed to the next event. There are also a number of optional things to hit and collect, like score bonuses and items thatll change the property of your shot to other things. And because its such a score heavy game, there are a number of online leaderboards present to compare against the world and friends, giving you some incentive to improve. Another aspect that I enjoyed is a chart after every stage thatll compare your scores across each individual shot, giving you some idea of where you do well, and where you could improve in any given round.Being a Kinect game, the biggest thing to worry about here is how Wreckateer actually controls, and honestly it does a pretty decent job. Theres definitely a few occasions where itll lose track of m and jump back to its starting position, but overall Im fairly impressed with how much precision the game allows. It helps that youve got an ability to control the ball post launch, which helps to alleviate some lack of precision in the actual launch, meaning that if youre off by a little bit you can generally get things back on track.A few different ammo types allow for after effects or different controls, usually triggered by throwing your arms up in a V shape. Some ammo will explode when this is done, whereas other will get a momentary lift of air, while another will sprout mechanical wings and allow you to fly it as if youre flying around your living room with arms spread wide. Knowing when and where to use these shots is key to scoring high, which seems relatively easy on the first couple stages but ends up being quite a challenge as you advance.Another thing that Wreckateer does well is that it staggers progression and new elements nicely. Theres a point towards the end where youll simply be using all your learned skills, power-ups, and unique shots in tandem with each other to score big. But theres a lot of build up to that moment, and Wreckateer doles out its various mechanics at a decent enough clip to not overwhelm the player, but also does so quickly enough to keep you from feeling bored.", "date": "August 6, 2012", "grade": "B"}
