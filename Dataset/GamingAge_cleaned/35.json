{"name": "Marvels Midnight Suns", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/12/marvels-midnight-suns-review-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc/", "text": "Given that Marvels Midnight Suns was developed by Firaxis games  founded by Sid Meier, famous for their work on XCOM and Civilization  I think most people (or, at least, me) went in expecting something along the lines of their other games (but mainly XCOM), just with a Marvel skin. I mean, the gameplay reveal clearly showed something different, but first impressions and assumptions can be a hard thing to shake.It doesnt take long for Midnight Suns to show that its a different game than those other Firaxis titles entirely. Sure, its a tactical RPG, but the mechanics here arent at all what youd find in those other games. Instead, its built around deck-building: each Marvel superhero has their own cards with their own abilities, and you need to decide which heroes you want to bring into battle depending on which cards help you build the best deck. Obviously, this isnt anything ground-breaking if youve ever played any strategy RPG that involved deck-building. Ive barely played any, and even Im familiar with the mechanic, so if youre a genre veteran youll know what to expect here. And, to Midnight Suns credit, the attacks are varied enough that you never feel like youre seeing the same things for this diverse cast of characters. And to be clear, attacks in that last sentence was deliberately chosen  theres the odd card that focuses on healing or blocking, but for the most part, this is a game that wants you to go on the offensive as often as possible. The bigger twist in Midnight Suns is that this is almost as much a social game as it is a strategy RPG. Your character  a mythical fighter named The Hunter revived from the dead by Doctor Strange and Iron Man  lives amongst the many Marvel characters this game features, and youre expected to get to know them at least as much as youre expected to rush into battle. It means theres a lot of talking to get through in between fighting, so if youre just after strategic battles between your favourite Marvel hero and hordes of mostly ineffective enemies, you should go in knowing that theres a lot more to this game than that. Of course, thats always kind of been the deal with Marvel compared to DC: its heroes were always intended to be much more human, so it stands to reason that the game would place such a heavy emphasis on socializing and learning about each characters past. But I can also imagine why some may wish there was a little less of that in a game that was developed by a studio renowned for their strategic RPGs. Dont get me wrong, Marvel Midnight Suns fits squarely into that lineage, but theres also much more to it than simply getting your squadmates into the right position. Its an interesting mix, but its also one that the game more or less pulls off pretty well.", "date": "December 19, 2022", "grade": "B"}
