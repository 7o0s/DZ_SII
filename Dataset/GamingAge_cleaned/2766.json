{"name": "Falcon Age", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/01/falcon-age-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4/", "text": "Falcons have had a surprisingly big fall when it comes to video games. I mean, theyre not in the same league as cyberpunk, but this year weve had both The Falconeer and Falcon Age. Given that I cant think of any other games starring or about falcons, that constitutes a pretty significant shift in representation for the Falconidae family.Mind you, it would do even more for falcons if the games in questions were actually good. The Falconeer certainly wasnt, and even though Falcon Age is substantially better, I dont think its going to be a game too many people are playing  or even remembering the existence of  six months from now.Of course, if Falcon Age is remembered at all, itll probably be entirely thanks to the fact the falcon in this game is so cute. Not only are you raising it from a little baby falcon to a full grown adult, you can pet it! And feed it! And bump your knuckles against its little claws in a gesture of friendship! If thats not a way of making you feel emotionally attached to your pet, I dont know what is.Ill also give the game credit for incorporating the falcon in a way that makes sense. While The Falconeer was basically a flying game with falcons instead of planes, here you use your falcon as partner and a weapon. You can send her to take down flying robot and other enemies, but also to capture desert animals and uncover buried mines/treasure. Falcon Age makes your falcon one of the games real stars, and it helps the game stand out.Or, at least, it would if the rest of the game werent so forgettable. The story is that youre embroiled in desert rebellion against a big corporation exploiting a planets resources, andwell, thats more or less it. You wander around a planet that all mostly looks the same, every so often shutting down refineries and battling native wildlife. Its pretty repetitive, and once you figure out that the key to victory is keeping your falcon close by until you need it to take out flying drones, its really more a matter of hoping you stumble across where youre supposed to be going than anything else.Still, Id be lying if I said I didnt enjoy my time with Falcon Age. It certainly has its share of flaws, but it also features some pretty great moments, and on the whole the latter outweighs the former. Plus  and this cant be overstated  you really do get attached to that falcon.", "date": "January 8, 2021", "grade": "B"}
