{"name": "MLB 15: The Show", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/04/mlb-15-the-show-review-for-ps4-ps3-ps-vita/", "text": "In general, Ive judged entries in the MLB: The Show series for how well they work as single-player, offline games. For the most part, this has served me pretty well. Its allowed me to turn my beloved Blue Jays into perennial World Series champions in numerous Franchise modes, and Ive sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into creating the best baseball player of all time in Road To The Show. Save for the odd detour into online home run derbies, Ive been perfectly happy playing the game all by myself.Its a good thing I wasnt looking for a robust online experience, because if I was, whats offered in MLB 15: The Show is so thoroughly terrible Id probably end up turned off baseball games for good.I know this has been the constant criticism against every game in the series so far, but its remarkable how little has changed in this, the tenth edition of The Show. Calling the games online play abysmal might be too charitable, since that might possibly imply that it kind of works. The fact is, online games in MLB 15 are thoroughly unplayable. Lag is a constant fact of life, which means that nothing works the way it should. Solid ground ball singles into the outfield suddenly find new life as fly balls. Soft infield pop-ups have a crazy tendency of turning into screaming line drive homers. A player with a bit of a lead off of first base will suddenly be sliding into second with a steal. Basically, ignore however a play looks at first, because odds are good its going to change a moment later.MLB 15s online is so bad it even fails at the basics of pitching and catching. It got so bad that I simply started throwing meatballs down the middle, since the game would invariably take them and turn them into something entirely different. A slider up and in? A beautiful 12-6 curve? A splitter in the dirt? Only The Shows servers know for sure, because I definitely didnt. And on the flip side, hitting turned into an unpredictable adventure on every pitch. Sometimes youd swing at a fastball that looked like it was right in your wheelhouse, only for the game to hiccup and decide the pitch was actually in the dirt in the batters box on the other side of the plate. Again, here I just gave up and ended up swinging at everything, confident that as long as I took enough swings, odds would be good that Id be rewarded with the occasional hit.Of course, this parade of errors and glitches was only possible when I was actually able to connectand the number of times I was able to find, connect with and finish a game against an opponent was embarrassingly low. Its probably worth noting that I had a slightly easier time of connecting with opponents on the PS3 version  though considering this meant entering the hellscape that is MLB 15 online, thats hardly a silver lining. (In a weird way, I guess, this arguably makes the Vita version of the game the best one  it may not have online play outside of the home run derby, but that means its also free of the glitches described above.)Admittedly, its hard to imagine many people are buying The Show for online play. Not when they haveuhRBI Baseball to play instead? Okay, not a great example. Nonetheless, I imagine most people picking up MLB 15 are doing so for similar reasons to why Ive always played it: because they want that definitive single-player experience.Funny thing, though: some of those same glitches that killed the online game seeped into offline play as well. I mean, it wasnt super common, and Im willing chalk a lot of it up to my own ineptitudebut at the same time, I dont think me sucking at analog pitching or hitting can be blamed for balls suddenly warping from one spot to another, or for hitters developing hitches in their swings that make them go from starting their swing to ending it instantaneously, with no in between motion to speak of. As I said, it didnt happen all the time, but it did happen enough for me to be a little concerned.For the most part, though, the offline MLB 15 experience was pretty solid. There arent any huge innovations, but the few that are here  particularly the Find a Trade option in Franchise mode  clearly add to the game as a whole. Franchise mode is still comprehensive (if not as comprehensive as OOTP 16). Diamond Dynasty does a great job of forcing you to slowly upgrade your team, and if youre the type who likes to pay to win, it allows you to do that too. And, of course, Road To The Show is as outstanding as ever; I dont know if I have it in me to take another player from Double-A rookie to 15-year veteran, but its still nice knowing I could if I wanted to.The only real complaint I have about the single-player experience  apart from those random glitches  is how stale the announcing sounds. Maybe its only the sort of thing you notice if youve spent roughly 500-600 hours playing through RTTS in MLB 10 on PSP, but if it werent for the fact Matt Vasgersian and Steve Lyons occasionally mention new players, I couldve sworn the dialogue today is pretty much exactly the same as it was half a decade ago. Of course, considering that the games online feels like its being played on a connection from even further back in time, I guess stale announcers are the least of SCE San Diegos problems.Because theres such a massive disconnect in quality between the online and offline versions of MLB 15: The Show, Im really not sure how I feel about it. The former is absolutely awful, so bad that if I werent a massive baseball fan already it would make me question how anyone could possibly like the sport. Its the sort of fundamentally broken gameplay that make people gnash their teeth over the Master Chief Collectiononly in The Shows case, its worse, since its never worked, no matter how many times fixes have been promised and allegedly implemented.", "date": "April 9, 2015", "grade": "B"}
