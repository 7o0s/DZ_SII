I love  love, love, love, love  word games. Some of my earliest memories involve playing Scrabble, and, as my iPod would attest if it could speak, that love has carried on well into my adulthood. The game Ive played more than any other over the last few years is Quarrel on my iPod (80+ hours and counting!); I seriously considered buying an Xbox 360 entirely so that I could get it as an XBLA game and play against other people. Basically, if the game involves putting letters together, you dont have to do much more to win me over.But Page Chronica does do more its a platformer, too. While I dont have quite the same level of ongoing devotion to platformers that I do to word games, its still a genre that, at its best, brings me back to the days when I was a young kid and I had to go over to my friends house to play Super Mario Bros. on his NES. Logically, then, combining word game elements into a platformer, as Page Chronica does, should be a surefire way to hit all the nostalgic pleasure centers of my brain.Unfortunately, what sounds amazing on paper (at least to me) doesnt quite translate itself to pixels. I can think of three explanations why this might be the case.First, Page Chronica doesnt explain itself very well. I mean, I get the word creation side of things: you press L1, you pick the letters with the right stick, you press X when youve got a word. Likewise, the platforming: you run, you jump, you avoid enemies. To that extent, its pretty straightforward.Beyond that, though? Im still not totally sure how things work. Creating words gives you spells, and special words give you special spells and rewardsbut the game never fully explains what the special spells and rewards are, or how you trigger them rather than a normal spell. Similarly, you can pick-up special power-upsbut for the life of me, I cant figure out why I need to, and the explanations the game provides dont provide much illumination.Which leads to the second reason why the game doesnt work as well as it should: because theres not really anything linking the two sides of the word game/platforming equation. I mean, apart from the boss fights, theres not any reason not to treat the game like a version of Super Mario Bros. where you cant jump on Goombas  youre being timed and scored regardless of whether youre spelling out words or doing the platforming thing, so it seems silly to focus on something that doesnt really help you get to the end significantly faster. In fact, seeing as how few enemies in this game can be disposed of with one shot, youre actually making it harder on yourself if you play the game the way its supposed to be played.Having said all that, I may be overlooking the most simple reason for my inability to enjoy Page Chronica: its not exactly meant for me.Dont get me wrong, Im a big fan of games targeting a younger audience, and Ive never let being well outside that age group stop me from playing them. But Page Chronica  with its bright (or gaudy, depending on your perspective) colors and word length limits  seems like its geared towards a younger audience. Much, much younger.
