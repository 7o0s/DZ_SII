{"name": "Carrion", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/carrion-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Carrion shows just how far a good hook can take a game.If you look at it from a relatively objective point of view (to the extent thats possible), its a pretty standard Metroidvania-style platformer, full of levels that gradually become more open to you the more skills you unlock. There are also some secrets hidden here and there, but for the most part, its pretty straightforward. Really, from a gameplay perspective, theres not much new about Carrion.But when you factor in that youre playing as a monster that has to kill everything in its path, suddenly it gets a whole lot more interesting.I mean, it doesnt change things up too much in terms of what you have to do. Youre still trying to make your way through a labyrinthine facility, and you still have to retrace your steps frequently as you become more powerful.But somehow, the fact you can launch out of the shadows and literally crush your enemies  or disembowel, or eat, or whatever else you want  adds a whole other, more fun layer to the game. Theres something immensely satisfying about seeing your monster get bigger and more powerful, and watching the facilitys inhabitants either fleeing in terror or futilely emptying their guns at you before they disappear in a pile of gore.The only real problem with Carrion is that the controls feel a little fiddly. I suppose that since youre a bloodthirsty monster, precision isnt your biggest concern, but its still moderately frustrating whenever youre trying to lunge at an innocent bystander and you have to take, like, three or four stabs before their head goes flying off.", "date": "August 24, 2020", "grade": "B"}
