Otherwise, youd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between this game and something like Robotron 2084 or its many imitators from decades ago. Scintillatron 4096 owes a huge debt of gratitude to arcade shooters from the early days of gaming, with simple gameplay (arguably too simple  more on that in a moment) thats all about shooting down enemies and racking up the points.And when I say all about shooting down enemies and racking up the points, I mean that quite literally: unlike the PS4 version, which includes a local 2-player competitive high score mode, the Vita version includes the base game mode and nothing else. I get that the games from which Scintillatron 4096 draws inspiration didnt exactly have a plethora of content, but it still feels a little light.However, if were talking about what Scintillatron 4096 does, rather than what it doesnt include, it does its one thing very well. Interestingly, its not a twin-stick shooter in the modern sense: you cant fly around the screen, blasting enemies from every which way. Rather, its a multi-directional shooter, in which your blasts can only go in eight directions. Consequently, your shots tend to be a little more controlled  and, as a consequence of that, the game places a premium on streaks, which you get by destroying all the enemies of one colour before moving onto the next. It makes the game much more methodical than its more modern-looking brethren, which isnt a good thing or a bad thing, but it does seem like something.Again, if youre looking for a game that offers tonnes of content, Scintillatron 4096 isnt it, especially if youre playing it on Vita. But if you played that Atari Flashback Classics collection and want to recreate the feeling with something newer, this game should do the trick.", "date": "February 12, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
