I start off little cool on it, then I get hooked, and next thing I know Im a decade into my Road to the Show career. Thats certainly what happened last year, when I didnt care for that game all that muchright up until the pandemic hit, and I wound up sinking more than a hundred hours into the game.So keep that in mind when I say the following two things:Ill take those two points in order.First, this is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. Ive played terrible baseball games, and this isnt one of them. Like every year before it, MLB The Show 21 captures the on-the-field aspect of baseball pretty perfectly. I may have lots of issues with the game  which Ill get to in a moment  but I cant deny this is, once again, the only choice if you want to play baseball on a console.Whats more, if youre picking up MLB The Show 21 on XBox, after years of your baseball options being RBI Baseball or nothing, this game will seem like a revelation. It almost seems unfair to compare the two series, because  this year especially  the gap is so enormous that it barely seems like theyre portraying the same game.And yet, no matter how much I tried to remind myself of those things, I cant say I was all that fond of MLB The Show 21.I suspect that a big part of my issues with the game probably stem from the terrible changes to Road to the Show. I know that Sony had said before that previous RTTS saves wouldnt carry over, but that didnt make it any easier to swallow that Id lost the 12-year career Id made in MLB The Show 20. Granted, there are definitely changes to the mode that wouldve made the transition difficult, but that doesnt make it any less annoying.It doesnt help that those RTTS changes dont seem to add anything. For one thing, its shockingly counter-intuitive to start a career as a personalized created player  you have to go into the creation function outside of RTTS, then save your player somewhere, then import them into RTTS. On top of that, once you start the game, youre immediately greeted with loud, shrill sportscasters screaming about your career (at least in the next-gen versions). I get that Sony was looking for some way to counter the more interesting career modes in every other major sports game, but its just so obnoxious, it feels like the wrong way to go.Moreover, making your player improve and advance is much grindier than in years past. You only earn XP if you play with the games preset sliders (though, admittedly, this goes a long way towards preventing the mockery of the game Ive made with my last few RTTS careers, where I was smashing records left and right). MLB The Show 21 also features loadouts for your created players, because if theres one thing a baseball game needs, its a feature thats borrowed from games like Call of Duty.Its pretty clear that the bulk of the developers attention here went to Diamond Dynasty. That, after all, is where you can build your teams, play historic moments  and, most importantly from Sonys perspective, buy packs of baseball cards to improve your teams and players. As someone whos never cared about that feature before, I cant say that theres anything this year to draw me in.The same could be said for this years Franchise mode, which continues to feel underwhelming. Most of it is carried over from last year, and theres nothing really special about it. Perhaps the most annoying part of Franchise mode is that, despite the fact that you can now create stadiums  even with dinosaurs replacing fans in the stands!  the game still couldnt include an expansion mode. Given that you can basically do that in Diamond Dynasty, it seems like a weird oversight for Franchises.Ill also add that March to October is still here. While its mostly unchanged, you can now tinker with rosters a little more, which, as far as Im concerned, makes it far preferable to Franchise mode.Also, notwithstanding my praise for the games portrayal of on-the-field action, I will add that the commentators here are basically the same as theyve been for the past several years. While Matt Vasgersian, Mark DeRosa, Dan Plesac, and Heidi Watney are all perfectly fine announcers/reporters, I have to say Im pretty sick of hearing the same dialogue from them as we heard last year, and the year before that, and the year before that. In fact, it feels like weve had Vasgersian as the MLB The Show announcer for years without changes, and it would be really nice if the game could mix things up a little.As I said up top, despite all my complaints, Im not going to deny that MLB The Show 21 is a solid, well-made baseball game. If you havent played the series in years, or if youre coming to it on Xbox, then its probably a must-play. But if youve been sinking years into it already, theres not much here that will make it worth playing.", "date": "April 21, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
