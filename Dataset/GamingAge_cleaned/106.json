{"name": "Rise: Race The Future", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/08/rise-race-the-future-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Rise: Race The Future could easily have been a disaster. After all, its a futuristic racing game built  in its own words  around drifting and sliding, only the drifting and sliding here are kind of lousy. Its never a good sign when your games core mechanic is an impediment to its own success.And yet, somehow, Rise succeeds despite that fatal-seeming flaw.What makes the game work is that you can simply ignore what it wants you to do, and do your own thing. If you just treat this as a straightforward racing game, rather than one where you have to go on long slides around neverending curves, it kind of works.Admittedly, this can still lead to frustration. The cars here have almost no weight to them, which means that getting bumped can be disastrous, since itll send you spinning off to your doom. Of course, this also means that you can ruin your opponents with a well-timed bump  but if youre close enough to your opponents that you can do that, then your chances of winning are already in jeopardy, since this isnt a game where you want to be stuck inside the pack.Luckily, Rise also makes it possible for you to go very, very fast  fast enough that you can zip past your opponents, and fast enough that, if you do it right, you dont need to worry about bumps. It takes a bit of luck, to be sure, and youre never so far ahead of your opponents that you can let up (do that, and theyll definitely catch you), but if you want speed, Rise has it.And good thing, too, because thats pretty much a must for any futuristic racing game that borrows from F-Zero, as Rise is. Its not set quite so far in the future as that franchise, but the spirit is definitely the same. The cars her all look like cars, only with all-terrain tires that take terrain very literally, and allow you to take your racing onto lakes and rivers.Of course, when you get there, youll find that the iffy handling makes the game far less enjoyable. The water portions of any track here are the kind of thing you endure, rather than enjoy.But if you can get through them, as soon as you get back on solid ground youll remember that theres a racing game here worth playing. Rise: Race The Future could definitely be improved, but theres a good enough base here that if youre looking for a fun futuristic racing game, this one (mostly) delivers.", "date": "August 13, 2019", "grade": "B"}
