In fact, if my knowledge of the first game was minimal, my exposure to Bioshock 2 was non-existent. Playing Bioshock 2 Remastered on the Switch is literally the first time Ive ever played the game on any platform, ever.And you know what? Its okay.I mean, in a vacuum, itd be one of the most amazing games Ive ever played. Its visually stunning, its got an engaging story with outstanding characters, and the combat is top-notch. I honestly cant think of anything about it that I dislike.The thing is, it doesnt really do anything that wasnt already done by the first Bioshock. Sure, there are differences here and there  you get to play as a Big Daddy this time around, instead of just fighting them; you occasionally get to go out into the ocean; you can jump  but on the whole, this is more a refinement of the formula the first game pioneered, rather than something totally different.To be sure, thats not the worst thing. As someone who loves Art Deco, Im never going to say no to the opportunity to see more of Rapture, which is exactly what Bioshock 2 offers. Even if it may not feel as new, its still eerie and gorgeous and everything that made the first one such a visual feast. Adding in bits where you traverse the ocean floor is also neat, and adds to the feeling of being in a strange undersea world.Further, by playing as a Big Daddy, the game opens up some slightly new avenues for combat. There are still plasmids, but you get some much more powerful weapons at your disposal. Couple that with a little more variety in the enemies, and you can see why this game is enjoyable.Just about the only real complaint I have about Bioshock 2 Remastered is that it doesnt pack quite the same punch as the original. Some philosophizing notwithstanding, it feels more like a straightforward shooter than either its predecessor or the final game in the Bioshock trilogy, Bioshock Infinite. Then again, as complaints about video games go, not enough philosophy is clearly not the worst thing you can say.And honestly, seeing as the first Bioshock is one of the greatest games ever made, Im not going to complain too loudly about Bioshock 2 going back to the well for (mostly) more of the same. Even if its not an all-time classic, its still a very good game, and if, like me, youve never played it, the Switch remaster is an excellent opportunity to dive in and discover what you missed.", "date": "October 8, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
