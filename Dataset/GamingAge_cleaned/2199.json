{"name": "Orgarhythm", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/11/orgarhythm-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "The more of Orgarhythm I play, the more unsure I am about my feelings towards it. In some circumstances, this could be a good thing  who doesnt want a game that challenges your perceptions of it as you get further in? Unfortunately, this isnt one of those circumstances. Rather, as I play through, Im conflicted between being completely baffled by it, and finding myself bored out of my mind.The bafflement comes because Orgarhythm really isnt a game that makes itself accessible to newcomers. When you start the game, youre not given any context for whats happening, and it makes no effort to explain to you what to do.Now, neither of these things completely cripples Orgarhythm, nor does their absence make it impossible to enjoy the game. If you open up the manual, youll find that there is, in fact, a backstory to the game  something involving feuding brother gods of light and darkness who apparently have chosen to resolve their differences via dance. Likewise, its not as if Orgarhythms mechanics are that hard to figure out  you tap the screen in time with the beat. There are different ways you can approach the tapping, of course, but generally, if youre able to keep time, youll probably figure most things out.But its not as if anything in the game is self-evident. I wouldnt have known the story was included in the manual, for example, if it hadnt been for the fact that I saw it referenced elsewhere. Similarly, while there is a tutorial, you have to go out of your way to play through it  its not a part of the core single-player campaign, and its down in the main menu next to Options. Even worse, it doesnt really explain everything. In all honesty, Ive played Orgarhythm for several hours now, and Im still not entirely clear on how everything works.That said, in those moments when I do have a handle on whats going on (or, at least, when Im pretty sure I know whats going on), I find that, more often than not, Im kind of bored. It really shouldnt be this way. At the start, Orgarhythm seems like it has a fair amount going for it: vivid colours, engaging beats, and the light god has some pretty funky dance moves.As the game progresses, however, it all starts feeling more repetitive. I know the same could be said for most games of this ilk  a key component of rhythm is, you know, repetition  but it seems like its particularly bad in this case. You just dance along the same, predetermined path each time, and you move at the same speed regardless of how well you do. You can die, of course, and get sent back to the beginning of the level (did I mention there are no save points within levels? Because there arent.), but beyond that, you dont have a whole lot of input into what happens.Pretty soon, the colors that looked vivid at first just seem to blend together  not a good thing, considering that when you engage opposing forces, theres no other way to tell the sides apart. The beats that were fun and engaging gradually start sounding the same except for some of the boss battles, when theyre abandoned in favor of slightly more avant-garde (read: tuneless) selections. And those funky moves? Still fun to watch, but its impossible to feel much of a connection to them when you realize they happen regardless of what you do.", "date": "November 8, 2012", "grade": "C-"}
