{"name": "War Theatre", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/06/war-theatre-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "War Theatre is the newest game from Arcade Distillery, and if youve been following their output so far, you know what that means: eye-searing graphics and awful gameplay. It was true of Plague Road (I honestly have no idea why I liked its looks back then), it was true of Mecho Tales, and, unsurprisingly, its true of War Theatre, too.Lets start with the graphics, becauseman, are they ugly. As with Arcade Distillerys previous games, the problem isnt so much how any one thing looks, but rather the sheer quantity of everything going on all at once at any given time. None of the individual elements are all that bad; in fact, some of them, with their goth/steampunk aesthetic, look kind of cool. Unfortunately, its hard to see them as anything but eyesores when the game seems set on cramming as much as possible onto every single screen.In War Theatres defense, its not quite as ugly as its predecessors, by virtue of the fact its colour palette has been toned down a little. Where Mecho Tales and Plague Road saw nothing wrong with a bit (okay, a lot) of neon, War Theatre, thankfully, is a little more restrained. That said, theres still far too many unnatural shades of yellow, red, green, and purple for this game to be described as anything but hideous, and your retinas will still feel battered by the time youre done with playing War Theatre.Of course, that brings to mind the broader question of why youd want to play War Theatre, since it also includes that other standby of Arcade Distillery games, subpar gameplay. Much like Mecho Tales and Plague Road, it makes its inspirations incredibly clear  in this case, Advance Wars  while, at the same time, never coming anywhere close to being as good as those inspirations.To be fair, War Theatre is better than both of its predecessors. Of course, given how directly it copies Advance Wars, itd be hard for the game not to be playable, since its essentially this gameplay, but with horribly ugly graphics. That said, every turn here feels like a slog, and every battle grinds along in a war of attrition until one side wins. While my exposure to turn-based tactics is relatively limited, Im willing to bet that the feeling such games seek to inspire isnt usually mind-numbing boredom.But, again, progress is progress, and War Theatre is undeniably an improvement over Mecho Tales and Plague Road. I wouldnt call it good, by any stretch of the imagination  no game that looks this bad could ever be described in such a positive light  but it is, at least, better. Baby steps, I guess.", "date": "June 3, 2019", "grade": "C-"}
