{"name": "InkSplosion", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/05/inksplosion-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "InkSplosion is not a very complex game. Its a twin-stick shooter where youre firing weapons inside a small, confined space at four enemies (or more if youve opted to play in arena mode). Clear them out, and you move on to the next level, where youre randomly assigned a new weapon. Every shot you take adds a little more colour to the screen, though it has no effect on the gameplay. Andthats it.Simplicity, of course, can be both a blessing and a curse. In InkSplosions case, it means that you know pretty much everything there is to know about the game within moments of picking it up, and it means that its fairly easy to become good at the game pretty quickly (as evidenced by the fact 70% of InkSplosion players have Platinum trophies). The downside: youll also quickly realize theres not much point to the game, and that once you get that Platinum about an hour or so into your time with the game, you wont have much more reason to play.Unfortunately, thats not the only downside to InkSplosion. For starters, its kind of ugly. You start off with a black and white screen, and it quickly fills up with colour as you fire weapons. Like I said, though, the colour has no impact on the gameplay, beyond making it more and more difficult to pick up enemy bullets and moving obstacles the more cluttered the screen becomes. Given that bright neon colours are both one of InkSplosions selling points and a key part of its identity, youd think that it would want to do something with it, but instead its an eyesore at best, an active impediment to enjoying the game at worst.The baffling design decisions are obvious in the weapons, too. You dont get to pick which weapon you start a level with, and the range of weapons is pretty limited. Despite this fact, however, InkSplosions developers decided to make one of the weapons  the rocket launcher  absolutely useless, since it has a delayed firing mechanism, and its rockets travel more slowly than any other projectiles. Its kind of bizarre that InkSplosions developers opted to include a weapon thats so thoroughly useless, but, well, here we are.One of the strangest things about InkSplosion, though, has got to be the lack of online leaderboards. After all, youre playing levels, racking up the points, andthats the extent of it. You can compete against your own high score, but, as with the quick platinum, the novelty of doing so wears off pretty quickly.Then again, so does the rest of InkSplosion. You may only play a couple of minutes (after you pick it up, realize its not for you, and quit) or you may play a few more minutes after that (after you get the Platinum, realize youve done everything there is to do, and set the game aside), but either way, your time with InkSplosion is going to be quick and forgettable.", "date": "May 31, 2018", "grade": "C-"}
