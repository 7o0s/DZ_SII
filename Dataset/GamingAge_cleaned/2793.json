Maybe its just me and my weird proclivity for games that borrow heavily from Nintendos franchise without actually being it, but just off the top of my head, in recent months weve seen Summer in Mara, Windbound, Oceanhorn 2 (the review for which well have up soon!), and, as youve probably deduced, Ary and the Secret of Seasons.The good news about Ary and the Secret of Seasons is that when it works, its substantially better than either Summer in Mara or Windbound. Those games may have borrowed their aesthetic from Zelda, but as far as gameplay went, they were middling at best. By contrast, Ary and the Secret of Seasons is generally pretty fun  again, when it works.As you can tell, thats a pretty huge caveat, but its also a necessary one, because Ary and the Secret of Seasons is also borderline unplayable at times. The game constantly freezes up, regardless of whats happening on the screen. It regularly cuts to black for no apparent reason. I died once or twice because I fell off the screen. Its very easy to get trapped between, under, and inside objects, which forces you to start over from the last save point.And those are just the obvious technical issues. Ary and the Secret of Seasons is also plagued by a host of other problems, big and small. The camera is brutal at times, and youre constantly fighting to find an angle that actually shows you where youre going and isnt partially obscured by something. The combat is imprecise  though, thankfully, its imprecise for you and your enemies alike, so youll both find that swinging your weapon doesnt always connect, even when it cuts straight through the other person/animal. The graphics are also hit-and-miss, and its not uncommon for the quality to sudden plummet for no apparent reason. The world may have a fair amount of people in it, but they mostly just stand around, waiting for you to talk to them. Really, I dont think theres anything in this game thats just unquestionably good  its all a good, butAnd yet, despite all those issues, I actually kind of enjoyed Ary and the Secret of Seasons. When everything is more or less working, you can see what the developers were going for: a Zelda-like adventure starring a young girl out in the world, trying to rescue her brother/save her town. Even if the world is inhabited by people who just stand around waiting for you to talk to them, its still a bright, colourful place. The combat may not always connect but at least it feels kind of fluid. And, most importantly, the story generally moves along at a pretty brisk pace, with an omnipresent yellow arrow on the minimap guiding you to your next goal.Of course, to get to any of the good parts, it requires that you put up with quite a bit of not-so-good. Personally, I thought Ary and the Secret of Seasons was worth it, but youd be well within your rights to figure its more trouble than its worth, and look elsewhere for your Zelda-like needs.", "date": "December 9, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
