{"name": "Wanderlust Travel Stories", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/05/wanderlust-travel-stories-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Even though it seems like visual novels are mainly a Japanese thing, the reality is that theres a Western branch of the genre too. Think of a game like 80 Days, where you revisit the Jules Vernes classic Around the World in 80 Days. It may be a little flashier than what youd see in games like Steins;Gate or Code: Realize, but at its core, its still a visual novel.You can see the same spirit that inhabits 80 Days also inhabits Wanderlust Travel Stories  that spirit, of course, being a Choose Your Own Adventure-style branching narrative (though not a direct copy, Ill hasten to add, since Id rather neither game get sued into oblivion). Here, as in 80 Days, you follow a characters journey, making key choices here and there to nudge the story in one direction or another.There are a few key differences in Wanderlust, however. The first is that this game is much more ambitious. Here, rather than following one person and his trip around the world, youre following nearly half a dozen peoples stories  each of them told slowly, unfolding over the course of a few hours, as you decide here and there where you think their vacation should take them.The second is that Wanderlust leans at least as much towards its literary side as it does its gaming side. I mean, it comes with both a manifesto and a bibliography. Each travelers tale strains to show personal reflection and growth, in a way that Id wager few games, visual novel or not, even attempt to achieve. While were hardly talking about incredible depths in Wanderlusts observations or reflections, this game is clearly intended to make you stop and think, rather than simply just acting.Mind you, this same impulse definitely makes Wanderlust feel a little pretentious. Its goals are well-intentioned, to be sure  at a time when borders and minds are closing rapidly, of course its good to think of all the world has to offer  but when you have a story about a young woman from Germany going on endlessly about how mystical and innocent the people of Thailand are, its hard not to see at least a whiff of orientalism (possibly the most literal way possible!) going on. To be fair, the counter-argument to that would be that I chose that womans path, and I could have just as easily made her a Western snob who did nothing in Thailand but party and shop, rather than going off to a feminist convent for a month  but even then, you dont have to look very deeply to know which direction Wanderlust wants you to take.But even if the deeper meaning of Wanderlusts politics are somewhere between pablum and deeply problematic, theres no denying that the game fulfills its goal of making you stop and read and think about what you want to do next. Its a visual novel that takes the novel part very seriously, and even if it accompanies its copious text with some gorgeous visuals, if youre going to play/experience it, youll better have your reading glasses handy.", "date": "May 12, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
