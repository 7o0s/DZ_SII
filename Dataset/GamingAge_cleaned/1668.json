{"name": "As Far As The Eye", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/05/as-far-as-the-eye-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "If As Far As The Eye wasnt a port of a PC game from 2020, I would have been certain that its name was chosen ironically. While it has plenty of other bad features, arguably its worst is that the text on the screen is incredibly tiny. Even playing the game exclusively in handheld mode, I had to get the screen pretty close to my face just to read what the game was telling me half the time.What makes this especially unbearable is that you have to do a lot of reading here. As Far As The Eyes campaign mode essentially consists of five tutorial levels, each of them featuring walls of tiny text. Given that the game is impenetrable even in the best of circumstances  more on that in a moment  youd think the developers would want to make that tiny concession of making it easy to read the lengthy info-dumps that accompany your every move. However, thats simply not the case: they want you to read, and they want you to strain your eyes as much as possible while youre doing it.Unfortunately, the text is more helpful than helpful. The game makes constant references to its own lore and just expects you to know what they mean. It tells you about halts and pupils and vagaries, except its never totally clear what those are, so youre left clicking around, hoping youll eventually stumble across what the game is telling you to do.You have to be careful not to click too much, though, because failure seems to be baked into the game. As near as I could tell, every level gives you thirty turns to fulfill its goals, before the map will be flooded and youll lose all your progress. During those thirty turns youll have to deal with events that, again, are never fully explained, which generally makes As Far As The Eye feel like every map is built around luck, and it doesnt matter if youre any good at the game  to the extent you can even be good at the game, since, again, nothing is ever explained.That said, youll nonetheless have to do lots of clicking around, since you can never tell when As Far As The Eye will register what youre doing. While it didnt crash on me too frequently  which seems to be a problem that many other people have had with the game  it still felt like a crapshoot whether following the directions would actually do what the game told me would happen. Theoretically, that could have been overcome if the game used the Switchs touchscreen controls, but instead, youre stuck with fiddly, unresponsive thumbsticks and buttons.As Far As The Eyes one saving grace is that its kind of pleasant to look at, provided theres no text on the screen. Given that theres lots of text on the screen, however, along with lots of incomprehensible gameplay and unresponsive controls, it doesnt matter how nice As Far As The Eyes visuals are when everything else about it is so awful.", "date": "May 25, 2022", "grade": "D+"}
