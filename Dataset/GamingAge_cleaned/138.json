{"name": "Neon Junctions", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/07/neon-junctions-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Neon Junctions may feature 80s-influenced, cyberpunk-tinged graphics, but make no mistake: its influences are much more modern. Portal, of course, is the obvious one, but you could sub in The Spectrum Retreat, or QUBE, or Talos Principle  really, any first-person puzzler will do.The obvious difference, of course, is that where those games all had things like stories, depth, challenging puzzles, and a budget, Neon Junctions does not. Its a bargain basement version of other, much better known games, and that comes shining through every moment you spend with it.That doesnt mean that its bad, of course. Neon Junctions core mechanic  you have to pick up boxes, and lay them down in a way that connects the power source to the exit  is easy enough to figure out, though it does start getting repetitive fairly quickly without any kind of narrative built around it. Likewise, the controls and camera are pretty smooth, which is just about all you could ask for in this type of game.All that said, however, its over awfully quickly. And, on top of that, theres no story, so theres little pushing you forward beyond the motivation of beating some fairly simple puzzles (and the allure of an easy Platinum, if thats your thing). Neon Junctions is a bargain basement version of some much, much better games  but as long as you dont expect more than that, its a decent enough diversion.", "date": "July 12, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
