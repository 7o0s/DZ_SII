{"name": "Atelier Sophie ~The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book~", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/atelier-sophie-alchemist-mysterious-book-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Fair warning: this may be the most negative positive review of a game youll ever read.In my defense, theres not a whole lot new to say about Atelier Sophie ~The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book~. Its the 17th game (not counting ports, remakes, and loosely affiliated spin-offs) in the Atelier franchise, and I dont think its an overstatement to say that the last several of them have all been pretty much the same: a pastoral setting, a spunky young heroine, some turn-based combat, and lots and lots of crafting. So it was with Atelier Escha & Logy, so it is with Atelier Sophie, and so Im sure it will be with Atelier Firis when that comes out later this year.Normally, making the same game approximately 17 times in a row would be a bad thing  except in Atelier Sophies case, it seems like itd be doing the games a disservice to complain too much. None of them (or, at least, none of the games Ive played) could accurately be described in any negative way. The characters are, almost without exception, well-written. Considering the debate about female characters in gaming, its disappointing that the Atelier games arent given a little more praise for the way they feature so many young women with agency and drive and intelligence. Sure, theyre wearing frilly little bloomers the whole time, but considering the alternatives  Gal*Gun and Senran Kagura, Im looking in your directions  theres something pleasantly anachronistic, even quaint, about the way heroines dress here.And speaking of intelligence, theres the fact that Atelier Sophie is a lot smarter than most, if not all, of its JRPG ilk. As has been the hallmark of the series to date, it places a huge emphasis on resource management and business simulation, and it expects that players will be able to keep up. Of course, this has been the guiding principle of all of these games, which means that if youve ever played one before youll know what youre getting into here, but its still nice to see a game that treats its players with so much respect.", "date": "September 30, 2016", "grade": "B"}
