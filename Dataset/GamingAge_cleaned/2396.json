Its a gorgeous game, and while it does take some technical shortcuts necessary for the hardware in comparison to the PS3 Uncharted titles, my jaw was in a constant state of drop while playing through the game. Seriously, Uncharted fans shouldnt be disappointed with how this game looks and performs on the Vita.This adventure predates the first Uncharted, showcasing a slightly younger, slightly more nave adventurer Nathan Drake as he gets embroiled in a conflict between a group or revolutionaries and his treasure hunting friend Dante. The new characters introduced here, both Dante and female lead Chase, are pretty decent additions to the cast. Its hard to deny that Chase constantly feels like a less than ideal Elena replacement, but theres still a pretty great dynamic between all three characters throughout the game.Much of the gameplay from the Uncharted series remains unchanged in Golden Abyss. Theres still a heavy emphasis on exploration through crumbling ruins, guiding Nathan across a number of slightly discolored handhelds that crumble through after releasing your last grip. Nathan still kills a whole lot of dudes, and the action is all in third person, incorporating a cover system and melee options as well. There are still a lot of optional treasures to find, marked by sparkling spots seen in various places across the 32 chapters that make up the games narrative.But, theres a lot of new stuff too. The game certainly goes out of its way toincorporate as much of the Vitas abilities as it can, some of which work and some that dont. For instance, when faced with a climbing section, you can now use the touchscreen to trace the path across the ledges for Drake to traverse, and the game will automatically move Drake across. When aiming your weapons you can not only using the analog sticks to adjust the crosshairs, but also assist using the built in gyro features of the handheld.Youll come across a serious of option and non-optional events that involve charcoal rubbings, piecing maps or photographs together, and other little tasks involving the touch screen. Youll even encounter a moment that involves holding the back of your Vita to a strong light source to make some previously invisible letters on parchment show on screen. Granted, a lot of this is gimmicky, and thankfully the developers do give players the choice to opt between regular button controls and the touchscreen for some of this, but not everything. Charcoal rubbings, the light shining thing, an awful balance beam mechanic, those are all forced on the player. The charcoal rubbings arent particularly intrusive, they take seconds to complete and are mostly optional, but the balance beam mechanic makes an odd return to the series after being used once in the original Uncharted with the Six Axis controller, and I cant imagine why anyone though it was a good idea.On the opposite end of that spectrum, a couple hardware gimmicks actually work out in the games favor. One is the grenade toss, which can still be performed with a button press, but becomes deadly accurate via the touch screen. Other little mechanics, like following a series of sliding directions on screen to move a door or guide a canoe down river, simply replace the button mashing mechanic that usually involves these actions, and for me I found that to be a welcome change. If nothing else it probably expands the lifetime of my little handheld ever so slightly since Im not mashing the hell out of the X or O button.The game doesnt use a multiplayer mechanic, which is a little disappointing, but not a huge loss considering the main story is still pretty beefy for a handheld. Theres a ton of optional treasure stuff to seek out, way more than any other Uncharted game has used before. Theres also a feature called the Black Market, which incorporates the NEAR app on the Vita, and allows you trade treasure items between other people you encounter playing the game on the Vita. If youre at all OCD in your video game playing, youll be spending a lot of time hunting down all the optional treasure stuff here.", "date": "February 17, 2012", "grade": "A-"}
