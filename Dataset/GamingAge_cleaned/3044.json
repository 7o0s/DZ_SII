No, Football Game was literally way, way too dark to see what was going on half the time. No matter how I squinted, no matter how much light I shone (or didnt shine) on the screen, for the most part it was just a dim, inscrutable blob.Some of this was undoubtedly intentional. After all, it was designed to be a creepy adventure game and, like any good horror movie, Football Games developers realized that its much easier to create that mood with lots of shadows.But the fact is, I have no idea what happened during the games climax, because I couldnt see anything on the screen when the game made its big reveal. Im assuming it was something shocking, because why else would they have made so much effort to build that mood, but if you were to ask me how the game ended, Id have to respond with a shrug.This is a shame, because Football Game does a pretty good job of building up a mystery over its short (and I do mean short  like, under half an hour) running time. You play as a high school football player trying to get to the big game and meet up with his girlfriend, except he cant find her anywhere. He gets progressively more annoyed as more and more people give him cryptic answers, and all of it is interspersed with the odd bit of static and dissonant guitars. Its not a perfect build, and you can tell that theres going to be some crazy twist from a mile away, but its good enough for what the game is.Likewise, the puzzles here are hardly what youd call challenging, but theyre solid enough that they dont get in the games way. Pretty much everything makes sense in Football Game, in the sense that its all pretty linear. It doesnt call for any huge leaps of logic: you find a key, and its for your car. You get a coin, and you use it to buy a can of pop. It wont tax your brain at all, but that means you can fully pay attention to whats going on in the story rather than trying to figure out some bizarre internal logic.Which makes the decision to make the game so hard to see so puzzling. Football Game is clearly trying to tell a story thats simple, straightforward, and super-creepy. But instead of coming away from it feeling vaguely uneasy, youll just be wondering what actually happened underneath all that very literal darkness.", "date": "March 10, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
