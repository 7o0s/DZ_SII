{"name": "Pokemon Black and White 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/11/pokemon-black-and-white-2-review-for-nds/", "text": "There are not a lot of long-running video game franchises out there that have managed to keep the same level of quality as Nintendo and Game Freaks Pokmon franchise, which started way back on the original Game Boy with Pokmon Red and Blue in 1998. And while the series hasnt seen a great deal of evolvement its certainly seen a number of incremental benefits over the course of its nearly 15 years of existence. But its worth saying that Pokmon Black/White 2 is about the biggest step forward that the franchise has taken since its humble black and white beginnings on Nintendos original portable platform.And that progression doesnt really come from the gameplay mechanics, which are more or less the same as any other game in the series. Youll still take on the role of a mute, young boy or girl protagonist, who grew up in a small town and sets off on an adventure to, indeed, be the very best. Youll get your first Pokmon before heading out, with the ability to select from three, and your rival/best friend will end up picking the Pokmon that yours is weak against.Youll then set off, explore high grass areas, gather up and train new Pokmon, evolve them, and battle them against various trainers on your way to tackle the Elite Four. So yeah, on the surface, not a lot has changed. And it would be great if it did, because quite honestly, theres certainly a bit of fatigue thats set in for me as a fan over the past decade and Id love to see some more chances taken here. But I understand that a lot of people would prefer that they didnt, and for those folks, theyll probably get a lot of enjoyment out of this entry.But what if youre hoping for a little more than your typical Pokmon adventure? Well, Pokmon Black/White 2 has you covered there as well. For the first time in the history of the series, Black/White 2 is a literal, honest to God sequel. And while youll take on the role of a new hero trainer, youll encounter a number of returning faces, enemies, and towns as you continue to explore the returning region of Unova.There are elements that will carry over from the first games to this entry, and not just your existing Pokedex. Youll have little references tossed about from your previous adventure, which is nice for consistency, and your plotline will directly tie into the plot of the previous game, like any standard sequel should. It adds a lot of depth to the story, something that were not used to seeing in the series so far. Not that the Pokmon games have never focused on story, but expanding upon an existing universe like Black/White 2 manages to do is certainly unique.The game also benefits from previous improvements, including the new Pokmon types introduced in the original Black/White games, and the additions of seasonal changes found there, along with the day and night cycles that were introduced via HeartGold and SoulSilver. And of course, the visual style of the original Black and White carry over as well, complete with improved animations that make for the best looking handheld Pokmon title to date.One other added plus is tossed in for 3DS owners, which is also nice considering this game was developed for the DS. Pokmon related apps available on the 3DS will work in conjunction with the game, and while Im not an active user of either, I can certainly appreciate the attempt to throw a bone to 3DS owners disappointed in the fact that the series hasnt made the transition yet. And its a nice attempt to appeal towards the hardcore fan base of the series, giving you even more content to check out and enjoy if you really like to delve into the fiction.", "date": "November 7, 2012", "grade": "B"}
