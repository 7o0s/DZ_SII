So, to start, Ill talk about what I dont like about the game.So..uhherrYeah, Ive got nothing. Pikuniku is an absolutely adorable game from beginning to end, a puzzle-platformer of sorts that draws inspiration from games like LocoRoco and Katamari with its blend of cuteness and absurdity, and that had me smiling from beginning to its all-to-soon end.The crazy thing is, Pikuniku is set in a dystopia. You (controlling Piku) are trying to free villagers from the clutches of Sunshine Inc., a villainous corporation stealing water and, uh, corn, and generally just being kind of mean. Its a game about corporate greed and evil robots. Yet, despite that, it approaches its topic with a sunny disposition. The colours here are bright, and the visuals jump off the screen, while the oddly-shaped characters you meet are always quick with a joke.As for the game itself, it brings together a whole bunch of different elements. Theres platforming, of course. There are also puzzles to solve here and there, some fun boss fights, and, in one memorable spot, a dance battle. None of it is particularly difficult, but that wouldnt fit in with the games overall vibe. Its also not very long, but as someone who always prefers 3-4 hours of excellent gameplay over 15+ hours with lots of filler, that doesnt bother me at all.In fact, nothing about Pikuniku bothers me. Its a happy, fun little game that needs to be enjoyed by everyone who owns a Switch, and the world is a better place with games like this in it.", "date": "October 1, 2019", "grade": "A+"}
