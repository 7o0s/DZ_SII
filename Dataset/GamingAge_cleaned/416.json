I mean, its far and away my favourite console ever, but the games Ive enjoyed on it the most  MLB The Show, Rogue Legacy, Hotline Miami, and so on  are all available elsewhere, too.Consequently, any time I come across a Vita exclusive, it always warms my heart. A PS Vita exclusive in 2018? Thats even more amazing. And for that 2018 Vita exclusive to be a pretty good platformer that makes use of all the handhelds bells and whistles, as is the case with Sir Eatsalot ? Well, if it werent on my Vita right now, Id probably think it was literally unbelievable. And yet, here we are, and heres Sir Eatsalot, and Im pleased to say that if its doubling as the last Vita exclusive we ever see, its a pretty great send-off for Sonys most misunderstood console.To some extent, Sir Eatsalot is good for all the usual reasons a game is good. The characters, from the titular knight down to all the random enemies and allies he meets along the way, are as fun and relatively well-written. Along those same lines, Gluttington, the kingdom in which the story takes place, is richly imagined, with tasty-looking foodstuffs falling from every tree and colours that make the world pop off the screen. And, of course, the story is as compelling as it needs to be, with a plot that makes sense and keeps the action going for a couple of hours.Whats surprising, though, is that another of the reasons Sir Eatsalot is good is that the controls make use of the Vitas aforementioned bells and whistles in ways that, for the most part, seem entirely natural.I call this a surprise because so often in early Vita games, the front and rear touchscreen felt more like annoying gimmicks than useful inputs. Here, by contrast, when you have to tap on a bush to shake the candy loose, or push the rear touchscreen to dislodge rocks, it doesnt seem all that forced. It feels as though Sir Eatsalots developers thought about their design options with this game on this platform, and came to the carefully-considered conclusion that touch controls made sense. And you know what? I dont disagree with them.Just about the only thing I disagree with here is the lack of any kind of world map. The kingdom of Gluttington may not be the biggest world Ive ever seen, but its big enough that youre probably not going to beat the game in one go  which means that when you put it down and come back to it, its not always easy to pick up exactly where you left off, since you may need to wander around until you remember where youre supposed to go.Still, all things considered, thats more a minor concern than a major issue, particularly considering all the things this game does well. The number of people who still care about Vita exclusives may be getting increasingly smaller every year, but for those of us who still care, its nice to know that games like Sir Eatsalot exist.", "date": "September 5, 2018", "grade": "A-"}
