{"name": "Hand of Fate", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/03/hand-of-fate-review-for-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Im generally not too big on card-based games. I dont usually have the patience to learn individual card values, or to memorize which cards beat which other cards, or any of the other stuff that goes along with all that. Plus theres the whole luck of the draw aspect that just doesnt appeal to me.You know what does appeal to me, though? Action. Lots and lots of action, preferably set up in a way that doesnt require too much strategizing. Basically, if I can just go in swinging, thats right up my alley.Which goes a long way towards explaining why Im such a huge fan of Hand of Fate. See, on the one hand, its undeniably a card game. You spend the vast majority of the game simply drawing cards and building decks, all as part of a plot involving a mysterious stranger in a cabin and the end of the world. Moreover, nearly every aspect of the game is ruled by luck of the draw, from what weapons you get to whether youre able to run away from bandits to whether youre able to dodge a rockslide.However, while all that may represent a good 80-90% of the the game, theres a still a decent chunk left  and its that chunk that makes me love Hand of Fate. Its the fact that your encounters with bandits and monsters arent determined by a roll of the dice, but rather by how well you fare in hack & slash combat against those enemies. Its the fact that when you discover a secret treasure vault, your success in reaching the treasure is based onwell, whether you can actually reach the treasure. You jump and dive and dodge your way past all kinds of hazards, with no hint of random chance about it.Its not great combat, of course. You may have a sword/axe/whatever, you may be facing down all kinds of robbers and skeletons and demons, and you may be crawling your way through dank dungeons the whole time, but no one is ever going to mistake Hand of Fate for something like God of War or Diablo in that respect. But its certainly good enough  good enough to engage someone like me, and good enough to be considered a point in the games favour. On top of that, its all very smoothly implemented. Theres a real sense of weight behind your thrusts and strikes, while the counter system is perfect  very obviously borrowed from the Arkham series, of course, but perfect nonetheless.I dont want to give the impression Hand of Fate is flawless, of course. The treasure dungeons all start feeling the same after awhile, as do the random battles. Dont get me wrong, Im not saying theyre not fun, but I dont want to give the impression that the world beyond the frame storys cabin is a vast or varied one. On top of that, I suspect that people who do like their card games to be, you know, card-based might not be too happy with the way the game lessens the role chance plays  though thats nothing more than idle speculation, since thats not an issue I have with the game.", "date": "March 5, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
