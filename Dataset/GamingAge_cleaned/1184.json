Its not good enough to evoke appreciation for it. Its not bad enough to make me feel outraged. Its not even average enough to stand as a median point for every other twin-stick shooter out there. Its just a game that exists.Seriously, I cannot emphasize enough just how indifferent I am to every single aspect of We Are Doomed. Its basically a blander, significantly more forgettable version of every entry in the Super Stardust franchise. The gameplay is a little less frantic, the world is a lot less vibrant, and the music is a lot more generic. Its just level after level of polygonal enemies in a flat, 2D world, with the occasional odd wrinkle in the form of more of them than usual or giving some of them guns. You fly around with the left stick, aim and shoot with the right stick. If youve ever played any twin-stick shooter, youve played this.Oh, and sometimes you shoot enough enemy ships to earn a very short-lived super-laser. This weapon, however, doesnt last particularly long, nor is it destructive enough to really be that exciting. Like everything else in We Are Doomed, its a perfectly adequate thing that works as its supposed to: nothing more, nothing less.I guess thats kind of an achievement, right? There are a lot of games for which It works isnt even something that can be said, so for We Are Doomed to function without crashing kind of counts asa thing?
