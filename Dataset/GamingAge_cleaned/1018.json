{"name": "Alone With You", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/alone-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Heres how I know that I love Alone With You: my only complaint with it is that the game suffers the occasional hiccup when its saving or loading a new scene.And thats it. Thats barely even a complaint, too. Its more me occasionally thinking to myself, Huh, thats annoying, and then moving on from that thought a few seconds later, as soon as the loading or saving is done and the game moves on. Its one teensy, tiny wrong note in a game full of right ones, and its something Im totally happy to overlook considering everything else Alone With You does well.Because my goodness is there a lot that Alone With You excels at. Most obviously, theres its look. The game is only slightly more advanced graphically than its creators last game, the pixel-heavy Home, yet it still conveys a sense of intimacy and warmth you might not be expecting. Alone With You may take place in a faraway world, and it may have be telling a story fraught with tension, but its design is so gorgeous, with a colour and an art style unlike anything else I could name, you cant help but feel immersed in its unique world.Its helped in this regard by the score. Like, say, 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Moon, Alone With You knows how to make a sparse soundtrack go a long way. Much like those cinematic masterpieces, the score here is simultaneously warm and inviting and cool and mysterious. I know theres at least a few contradictions in that last sentence, but believe me: once you hear it, youll know what I mean.Also like those movies, Alone With Yous real strength  more than its visuals, more than its score  is its story. The game bills itself as a sci-fi romance adventure, and, somehow, it doesnt skimp on any of those descriptors. The stories here branch slightly depending on your choices, but whichever way you go, youre guaranteed to be immersed in a tale of alienation, isolation, companionship, and hope. Again, those qualities may seem contradictory, but in the hands of a work of art like this one, its clear that there are no inherent contradictions at all.", "date": "September 19, 2016", "grade": "A+"}
