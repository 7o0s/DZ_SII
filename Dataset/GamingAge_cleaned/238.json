Its good when youre consuming it, but after you step away from it, it all just feels like a lot of empty calories. Admittedly, you dont feel all greasy if you spend an hour playing Mages of Mystraliabut Ill stop there before I take this analogy any further than it needs to go.In any case, Mages of Mystralia is basically a solidly above-average isometric RPG that youll mostly forget not too long after you stop playing. Playing as Zia, a young girl who discovers she has magic while living in a village where magic is banned, you run around a fantasy world fighting monsters and learning more about her powers. Theres a broader story  one written by prolific fantasy author Ed Greenwood, who was also behind Baldurs Gate and too many Dungeons & Dragons novels to count  but, truthfully, its about as generic as they come.The good news about the game is that it allows you to customize your spells using runes. You start off with only a couple of basic spells to cast, but before long, youre able to fire them across the screen at your enemies and make them do all kinds of neat things. Its not ground-breaking, but its different enough from how spell-casting usually works that it makes the game seem a little different in that one respect.Its also worth noting that Mages of Mystralia looks really nice. Mystralia is a brightly-coloured world that seems alive, and its easy to get good feelings about the game as youre playing it because its so vibrant and welcoming. Of course, the fact that youll see a lot of it because the fast-travel system leaves a little to be desired and generally pushes you to do lots of walking lessens the impact after awhile, but its still nice to see a game with such a varied colour palette.As I said, though, its hard to imagine anything here sticking with you much beyond when youre playing it. Youre sure to enjoy Mages of Mystralia while youre playing it  and if youre a fan of isometric RPGs, its certainly worth thinking about playing it  but I cant imagine itll stick with you once you put the controller down.", "date": "March 26, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
