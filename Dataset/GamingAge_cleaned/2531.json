{"name": "Gnosia", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/10/gnosia-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Lets get the obvious out of the way right off the bat: Gnosia is a social deduction RPG set on a spaceship, where you have to deduce who the imposter is and vote them out before they can eliminate everyone. Like, Ive never even played Among Us and even my mind jumped there right away, so I imagine if youre someone whos played a lot of that game, youll see the similarities even more clearly.On the bright side  at least for me  because Ive never played Among Us, I didnt go into Gnosia burdened by the weight of expectations of how I thought it should play. I was able to experience its story and its gameplay with fairly fresh eyes.And based on thatI still found it to be kind of derivative. Not, as many might think, of Among Us, but rather of another game that a) features visual novel elements pretty heavily, and b) calls on you to deduce who the murderer is via a series of interrogations and voting  Danganronpa. Its not as insane (or as gory, or, to be honest, as good) as Danganronpa, but for me, the similarities were pretty hard to ignore.Mind you, even if it falls short of the game(s) it emulates, Gnosia still has a few things going for it. First off, not only is its gameplay loop incredibly addictive, it also does a great job of making the game more and more tense the further in you get. Each round (or loop, as the game calls them) finds you interacting with your shipmates  both one-on-one, with occasional opportunities to privately chat with others, and in groups, where youre subjected to a lightning round of interrogating the others, listening to what they have to say, defending yourself/your allies, and then voting on whether you want to send someone to deep freeze. It all moves very quickly, and with each round adding in new people and new twists, its very easy to get sucked in.The other thing working in Gnosias favour is that it doesnt skimp on the visual novel aspect of the game. This is kind of essential, since its single-player rather than multiplayer like Among Us, and its done well. While it doesnt come close to matching Danganronpa in terms of insanity, Gnosia still features a set of well-defined characters that each stand out, and couples that with an engaging, creepy story.Obviously, the big problem with Gnosia is that it seems to exist more in relation to other, better (or at least better-known) games, rather than standing out on its own. While this status is mostly deserved, compared to most visual novels Ive played/read, theres still lots here youll find interesting if you want to give it a chance.", "date": "October 7, 2021", "grade": "B"}
