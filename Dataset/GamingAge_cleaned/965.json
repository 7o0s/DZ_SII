{"name": "Claire: Extended Cut", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/11/claire-extended-cut-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "The good news and bad news about Claire: Extended Cut are one and the same: its influences are clear, as are its contemporaries. This means that its easy enough to classify, but that also means that its easy to spot where the game isnt as good as it could be.Lets start with the basics: its a 2D pixelated horror game. That puts it squarely alongside the likes of Lone Survivor, Home, and all kinds of games on Steam. Not only that, its in the same neighbourhood as Neverending Nightmares, and not too far removed from Oxenfree, to say nothing of the Corpse Party franchise. Thats impressive company, for the most partbut apart from maybe Neverending Nightmares, its all company that makes Claire look pretty mediocre by comparison.The problem is that Claire doesnt do any one thing as well as any of its peers. Where Lone Survivor sounded incredible, and the Corpse Party games do a good job of grossing you out, and Oxenfree had a really compelling narrative, theres nothing in Claire that really stands out as exceptional. Its soundtrack is practically non-existent. Its gameplay is repetitive, and mostly consists of wandering halls until you stumble upon enemies, at which point you run and hide until they disappear. It does a really lousy job of explaining it controls, and it forces you to remove yourself from the action at regular intervals as you check the map to confirm youre moving in the right direction.Its not all bad, mind you. Most notably, Claires graphics do a great job of creating a creepy, nausea-inducing atmosphere  no small feat when you consider what its working with. 2D or not, when this game throws in blood or gore, it made my stomach turn in a way that most 3D games cant manage. (Though, Ill hasten to add, it doesnt hold candle to Corpse Party.) And on the non-aesthetic front, the game has a pretty decent story; the game is all about the titular character exploring traumas from her past, and it delves into that in a fairly compelling way.", "date": "November 7, 2016", "grade": "C"}
