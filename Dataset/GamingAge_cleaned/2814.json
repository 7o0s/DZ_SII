{"name": "Bartlows Dread Machine", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/11/bartlows-dread-machine-review-for-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "Even though they both fall under the same broad shooter umbrella, to me, twin-stick shooters and on-rails shooters dont seem like theyd mesh all that well. One is all about moving around as you flee wave after wave of enemies, the other is, as the title implies, moving you along a fairly predetermined path, killing enemies as you go.That was my thinking going into Bartlows Dread Machine, a steampunk-tinged on-rails twin-stick shooterand, unfortunately, thats my thinking coming out of Bartlows Dread Machine, too. Its kind of a half and half game, in that you run along tracks, but youre being pursued by endless waves of monsters.It also doesnt help that the shooting is kind of wonky. Apart from some sections here and there where you get a chance of view, the game is shot from an angle at the side. You can see the entire board layout, but depth perception and angles arent always super clear, which means that, much of the time, youre better off retreating and allowing enemies to come after you  which, seeing as youre all on rails, means they all line up in a row as you shoot them to pieces. While its satisfying the first few times, its not what Id call fun.And yet, at the same time, Bartlows Dread Machine is far more fun than it has any right to be. Its got a fantastic retro aesthetic  and not retro in the usual sense, but retro in that it has a heavily steampunk vibe, and its presented as an old-timey arcade machine, where everything flips up and it looks like its run by clockwork. Coupled with a story about anarcho-Satanists kidnapping Teddy Roosevelt, its clear that a lot of love and care went into this games creation.Still, it would have been nice if the gameplay were anywhere close to being as great as the premise. If we were going by looks and ideas alone, Bartlows Dread Machine would be an easy GOTY contender. As it stands, its simply a great-looking game with more than a few flaws  but those looks are so good, they might just be enough to make this game worthwhile.", "date": "November 24, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
