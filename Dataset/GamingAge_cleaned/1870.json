Also judging from their output to date: they might just be right. So far, each of their releases on Sonys handheld  The Flying Hamster HD, Sunflowers and now Crazy Market  have seemed like the sort of thing that might have a more natural fit on a smartphone (in fact, two of them are available for mobile devices and tablets already), and so far, all three of their games have shown themselves to be natural fits for the platform.Im sure people who prefer doing their gaming with buttons (a group that includes me) probably cringed at that line. But you know what? With its front and back touchscreens, theres no reason why any number of great iOS and Android casual games wouldnt work just as well on the Vita. While I wouldnt quite place The Game Ateliers output on the level of, say, Angry Birds or Burn the Rope (both of which, it should be noted, were also ported to the Vita, with fantastic results), I would say that theyve consistently created games just a tier below.Crazy Market certainly solidifies that notion. Its a fun game, with bite-sized levels that seem tailor-made for pick-up-and-play sessions in a way that neither Flying Hamster nor Sunflowers were  even at their longest, the levels here can be raced through in just a few minutes, while its use of star ratings makes it easy to go back and try levels until you ace them. Not only that, its got simple, straightforward controls  scan the grocery items you want to keep, flick away the distractions like bombs, dogs and babies  that seem like theyd be impossible to forget, regardless of how long its been between sessions.So its got a lot of the good things mobile gaming has to offer. Unfortunately, Crazy Market also has the one big bad: its a Free-to-Play game, and the only way to get the full experience is to pay. See, your on-screen character apparently never goes home to sleep at night, and as a result (s)he has a crippling addiction to coffee, to the point that, once you reach the tenth level or so, youll need to consume another cup for every new level. You earn a couple of those in-game, but if you want to avoid waiting for your character to recharge every few levels, youll have to buy them using real currency  though the game also offers you the chance to buy 500,000 in-game coins for the low, low price of $14.99. Admittedly, at this point, thats basically motivating force the behind F2P games, so complaining about it now is the reviewing equivalent of the horse and the barn door. Its hard not to be irked by it, but thats the way it goes, I guess.", "date": "November 12, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
