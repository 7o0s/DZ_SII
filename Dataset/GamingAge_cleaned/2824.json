{"name": "The Falconeer", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/11/the-falconeer-review-for-xbox-series-x-xbox-one/", "text": "While I wouldnt say I was over-the-top excited for The Falconeer, I did approach it with some amount of enthusiasm. After all, its the first game Im playing on my Series S, and I was eager to see what innovations the new generation would bring.In The Falconeers case, not a whole lot that you couldnt have gotten from the previous generation. In fact, if youve played any aerial combat games in the last, like, twenty years, Id say that theres nothing here that you havent seen many times before.To be fair, it does probably look better than most other games. Flying across the ocean can be breathtaking, whether youre soaring through stormy clouds or skimming along the surface of the water. Without a doubt, the game does a very good job of capturing that feeling of flight.Unfortunately, a lot of the magic of that wears off as you realize theres not much else The Falconeer has to offer. You fly to waypoints on your map, you engage in a protracted dogfight with other falcons, and then you fly off to repeat that somewhere else. You realize pretty early on that what youre doing in the tutorial is what youre doing for the entire game.This, in turn, is an issue, since its not particularly fun. The controls are kind of wonky  as enjoyable as it is to soar, the birds here arent exactly the most agile things in the world, so you spend a lot of time banking around and coming in for a new pass, and doing that over and over again until you finally shoot down all your enemies.All of this is probably fine if you want to do is aerial combat for a couple of hours. The Falconeer really only does that one thing, so if its your thing, then youre in luck. Dont expect anything more than that, though, because theres pretty much nothing else to do.", "date": "November 13, 2020", "grade": "C"}
