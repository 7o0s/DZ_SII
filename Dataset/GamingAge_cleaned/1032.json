{"name": "Day of the Tentacle Remastered", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/day-tentacle-remastered-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "In general, my feelings towards Day of the Tentacle Remastered are pretty much the same as they were towards last years remastered version of Grim Fandango: I can see why its held in such high regard, but its also easy to see how far the genre has come since the game first came out.In fact, this is probably even more true for Day of the Tentacle, since the game itself makes the difference so plainly obvious. Just press Select (at least on the Vita version), and it instantly transitions to its original interface in all its command-heavy glory. Do that, and theres no moving the cursor and clicking in the direction of where you want your character to walk, nor is there any clicking on objects to investigate what they do. Instead, that old version has a list of text commands, and a list of objects, and its up to you to figure out how they match. As someone who didnt grow up with these games, its a pretty stark contrast, and it makes me appreciate the effort that went into updating Day of the Tentacles gameplay for a modern audience.Likewise, the presence of the older version reveals just how much the remastering process helped Day of the Tentacle in the looks department. In its modern state, its nothing special. In fact, with all its weird angles and wacky colours, you could even say it feels a little dated. However, its by no means an eyesore  which is another dramatic difference from the original, which looks like a full-on 90s relic. (And dont even get me started on the hidden  and decidedly non-remastered  version of Maniac Mansion.)Surprisingly, the one area in which the game feels freshest is also the one the least impacted by the updates: the dialogue and the humour. To be sure, a lot of it feels like a holdover from the 90s; even accounting for the fact that the game owes a heavy debt to media that was decades-old when Day of the Tentacle came out, the overarching sensibility is still one that can be pinpointed to 1993 or so. However, thanks to the fact that Tim Schafer and his Double Fine cohorts were  and remain to this day  such genius writers, it still works in the same way that most good comedy from the era still works: the reference points and ideas at work may be a little different, but its funny enough that youre guaranteed to at least crack a few smiles throughout the game. On top of that, the plotting is done well enough that the game knows how to get you interested and keep you that way all the way through.", "date": "September 6, 2016", "grade": "B"}
