{"name": "Mr. Blaster", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/10/mr-blaster-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Mr. Blaster describes itself as being heavily influenced by Worms, and, in a way, this is accurate. After all, its a game where you fire projectiles at your enemy, and you have to take into account things like angles and shot velocity. If thats not a rough description of Worms, I dont know what is.But, of course, Worms is a lot more than that, and Mr. Blaster isnot. Like, at all. To call it a pale imitation of Worms would be to do a disservice to the term pale imitation. Mr. Blaster is a barebones, bargain sub-sub-sub-basement version of Worms. Theres nothing here beyond the rough sketch of an idea.What is that idea? Your character stands on one platform, your opponent  be it human or AI  stands on the other, and you take turns hurling projectiles at each other. Theres not much in the way of skill involved; even though the platforms move up and down, they do so slowly enough that you just need to wait for them to pull level, and then throw with all your might.And thats literally all there is to it. You can unlock up to 20 characters, but youre doing the same thing with all of them: aim, throw, repeat. The environments never change, and the objectives never change. Its just constant, boring back and forth.Admittedly, at just $2, its hard to be that worked up about Mr. Blaster. But plenty of mobile games have shown that $2 can still give you a lot of content  and content is one thing Mr. Blaster clearly doesnt have, which is why you should feel no concern about skipping it.", "date": "October 4, 2019", "grade": "D"}
