{"name": "Super Hydorah", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/01/super-hydorah-review-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Theres not sense beating around the bush or using too many extra words here: Super Hydorah is a ultra-hard, retro-looking shmup.Like, thats almost literally all there is to say about it. Theres not much story. The controls are exactly what youd expect out of a shmup: your ship flies left to right across the screen as you fire various weapons at enemies and space debris. The graphics come straight out of the late-80s/early-90s, as does the music. If youve ever played a shmup  if youve ever seen a shmup  youll have a good idea of what to expect here.Just about the only twist (for lack of a better word) is that Super Hydorah is incredibly difficult. Enemies can kill you with a single hit, and theyre relentless in coming after you. Its one of those backward-looking games that believes the lesson to draw from previous generations is that they should be as painfully tough as possible, and that you can only have a good time if youre dying constantly.In other words, Super Hydorah isnt really for me, since dying over and over again has never been my cup of tea. But it is for some people. So if youre one of those people, and youre into shmups, good news: heres your new favourite game.", "date": "January 29, 2018", "grade": "C"}
