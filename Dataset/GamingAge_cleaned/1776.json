{"name": "Yoshis New Island", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/03/yoshis-new-island-review-3ds/", "text": "I cant imagine the pressure felt by developers creating titles under the Nintendo brand, taking very popular, existing franchises and attempting to put their own spin on things. If there is any studio that seems to excel at this, it has to be developer Retro Studios. Between the Metroid Prime series and their Donkey Kong Country revival, they are clearly the fan choice for best non-Nintendo development team creating Nintendo titles.And then theres Arzest.While Arzest is a somewhat new group comprised of ex-SEGA and Artoon members, they still have a number of experienced people on staff. And some of that experience actually shines through with Yoshis New Island. But whether its due to inexperience or talent, there are also a number of unfortunate missteps with this 3DS release that make for a less than desirable attempt to breathe life back into Yoshis Island.Yoshis New Island follows the general formula found in previous titles, starting with the original Yoshis Island that debuted on SNES in 1995. Youll play as Yoshi, with Baby Mario riding along, attempting to clear level after level across a number of colorful worlds. This is a 2D platforming experience with an emphasis on collecting hidden items, uncovering secrets, and overcoming tricky jumps and obstacles along the way. Like most modern Nintendo platformers, theres not much effort needed to just finish a stage. Youll have a multitude of extra lives at your disposal, and getting from point A to point B isnt too hard. The challenge comes more from finding and getting to the three major collectibles, a number of which inhabit each stage.This element certainly isnt too far removed from the first game. There are still 5 flowers, 20 red coins, and 30 stars to collect. Stars still double as life points, which slowly wind down if you get separated from Baby Mario, typically after youve been hit by an enemy or hazard. Yoshi can still do a mid-air flutter, boosting the height of his jump and allowing him to stay aloft. Theres still a big emphasis on eating enemies and turning them into eggs, which can then be thrown at other enemies, obstacles, or question mark clouds that unveil various things.And all of these returning elements feel great here. I dont think Arzest has really messed up anything when it comes to the standard controls, or the overall feeling of these actions. The flutter jump feels pretty close to how I remember it. Theres no run button for Yoshi, but his top speed amps up quickly when moving in one direction, feeling pretty reminiscent of classic Sonic the Hedgehog in that regard. There are a few neat moments here that involve a Super Star for Yoshi, allowing him to run so fast that he can travel up walls and ceilings, with sections of stages designed around the concept, often filled with neat transitions between floor and ceiling. Really, everything related to the standard controls feels great.But then theres the forced gyroscope controls. Not all of these segments are awful, but most are annoying and gimmicky, with no alternative control options to make these sequences less frustrating. There are a number of points in stages where youll enter a doorway and Yoshi will transform into some sort of vehicle, like a submarine, helicopter, bobsled, jackhammer, and so on. Youll need to guide Yoshi along a scrolling, timed mini-stage, attempting to collect coins, dodge or destroy enemies, and bust through obstacles. Sections like the bobsled or jackhammer are fairly easy to control, but anything involving flight tends to be problematic, and will have you twisting your 3DS all over the place in order to try and stay on track. This isnt too bad at home, but in a public setting where youre likely to be playing a portable device, its less than ideal.I also dont think Arzest nailed the art direction they were going for with Yoshis New Island. When the game was first revealed, I thought maybe the visuals were pretty early, and would surely improve. But every trailer or screenshot that followed did little to improve my initial reaction to the visuals. There are moments here where the game actually looks pretty good, and the pastel/colored pencil effect manages to shine. This tends to happen when faced with larger enemies, bosses, and colorful background or foreground stage elements. But most character models, including Yoshi and Baby Mario, look like a blurry mess. That hand-drawn look that made the original game stand out so well does not carry over here.That said, despite issues with the look of things, I do think the overall stage designs are pretty solid. The first two worlds can be a bit bland, and dont necessarily do the game any favors when it comes to first impressions. But from World 3 onwards I really enjoyed the gameplay offered by Yoshis New Island. Stages tend to get more inventive and uncovering all the collectibles starts to become a really satisfying challenge.Various elements are introduced throughout the worlds at different points, and are repeated just enough to keep them from wearing out their welcome. In one stage youll be chased by a giant Chomp-Chomp, while another will have you riding across the backs of birds in order reach platforms suspended in the sky. Another stage will have you consume a giant metal Shy Guy, and then use the huge metal egg produced as an anchor to keep Yoshi from floating while underwater. These various concepts prevent the game from feeling monotonous, and break up the standard platforming moments nicely.Its a shame that some of that inventiveness didnt make its way into the soundtrack. The music in Yoshis New Island is the most aggressively awful element youll find within the game. Its not the repetitive nature of the primary theme, or the overreliance on remixes of that theme, but just the general quality of the tunes produced here. There is not a single musical track in the game that I enjoyed, or would want to hear again. There are a number of forgettable themes, but then theres also a few that are bad enough to make you want to turn the volume off completely. I can understand the need to go for something whimsical and childlike to match the visual style of the game, but there are moments where I swear Im listening to a bunch of preschool kids slamming Fisher Price toys together to make music.", "date": "March 13, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
