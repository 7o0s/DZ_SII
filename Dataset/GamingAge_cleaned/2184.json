{"name": "Persona 4 Golden", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/11/persona-4-golden-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "If you played Persona 4 on the PS2, I doubt that I really need to tell you that its a pretty awesome RPG, and easily one of the best on Sonys last-gen platform. Hell, it remains one of the best Japanese RPGs developed this decade or last, and stands out as the pinnacle of Atlus Persona series in my opinion. So when I say that Persona 4 Golden is a must buy for Vita owners, I imagine you wont find that too surprising.And as far as ports go, Persona 4 Golden is top notch. Youve got a substantial amount of added content, along with all the previous content that made the original game so great. If you havent played the original game, youre going to be in for a real treat here. In Persona 4 you take on the role a young high school student transferred to a new school to live with his uncle and young cousin. You end up befriending a small group of eclectic friends. Just as quickly you become embroiled in a series of mysterious murders plaguing the region, and along with your friends, unlock the ability to unleash Persona, powerful spirits, which youll use in combat against shadow creatures and other monsters.The combat system in Persona 4 Golden consists of four person groups, where you can either directly control your teammates or allow the AI to do the lifting. The AI isnt really up to the job though, youll most likely want to take direct control at all times, especially considering the system relies heavily on a rock/paper/scissors system of exploiting weaknesses and strengths in most fights. If youre familiar with most modern Shin Megami Tensei titles, this system will probably be second nature. Character Personas are typically outfitted with lightning, dark, light, fire, ice, or wind properties, and are typically weak to the opposite. Most enemies are the same, and boss fights require smart use of these elemental weaknesses to overcome. This is completely unchanged from the original version of the game, and the default difficulty feels on par with the original.The exploration side of the game involves a handful of areas accessible outside of the main dungeon worlds, allowing you to visit shops, your local school, a mall dubbed Junes, and a riverfront/plains area. You can easily move between areas by bringing up a quick travel menu at any time, or opt to walk from location to location, exiting out to an overworld map when you reach the end of an area. These locations can be rife with side quests to tackle, and also offer up the locations where youll be spending time maxing out your all important Social Links.The Social Link system allows you to mature your relationships with fellow students, your battle group, and other strangers. These sequences usually involve spending a chunk of time on a certain day of the week with the other individual, engaging in conversation options, and attempting to gain some sort of new understanding or insight into that person. If done successfully, you can level up your link with that person. Doing so ties back into the Personas you can create, by fusing together one Persona with another. When you fuse Personas, youll create a new one of a certain type, and if that type matches the Social Link, youll get an experience boost. So it pays to max out these relationships when possible, and theres an interesting mechanic present in Persona 4 that really challenges you to use your time wisely, with some neat risk/reward elements in place.As far as the new additions to the game found in the Vita port, theres a number worth mentioning. There are two new Social Links, one of which comes from a new character that gets introduced mysteriously early on (as early as the intro sequence). Other changes are a little more nuanced, like the option to save your game almost at the onset of your adventure, instantly making the game a little more portable appropriate. Theres also an option to leave your house at night and explore the nightlife of the area, giving you new people to encounter and options to explore. Theres also some interesting online functionality, which will allow you to call on the help of other players for battles, and youll have the option to see how other players chose to spend any day youre currently on. This latter feature is particularly awesome, its really neat to see how others used their time at different points, and helps give you some opportune pointers if youre having trouble making a decision.There are also some additional features for the fan base, in the form of TV stations accessible from the main menu of the game, allowing you to view Japanese commercials for Persona 4 and other Persona titles. Theres also some cool live footage of concerts for soundtrack fans, which I found particularly fun to check out. Its not exactly game changing stuff, but the additional content is well presented, and doesnt come through in some awful, low resolution video. I love seeing stuff like this as additional features, more so than your standard concept art, so I definitely appreciate the addition.One of the things that really sold me on Persona 4 the first time I played through was the fantastic character development. While your character, the unnamed protagonist, is more of a blank slate for everyone else to play off of, every character introduced via Social Links or the main party group are extremely well fleshed out and detailed. Regardless of how late in the game a person is introduced, its almost guaranteed that youll get some sort of resolution as far as their individual story goes. While the combat system in Persona 4 might not be categorized as amazing, the way it deals with story and plot progression, and gives you a number of fully realized characters, is.I was also pleasantly surprised out how well the game transitions to a handheld platform. Its no secret that this is a very long RPG, but its easily consumed in small chunks, and the small changes to where and when you can save make this perfect for picking up and playing any time. It also helps being able to suspend the game any time via the Vitas OS, allowing you to more or less quick save any time you want, provided you dont need to access another program or game.", "date": "November 21, 2012", "grade": "A"}
