{"name": "Drifting Lands", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/06/drifting-lands-review-pc/", "text": "Have you ever heard of an action RPG Shoot-em up? Well, now you have, with the release of Drifting Lands on PC, which came out of Early Access earlier this month. While the SHMUP side of the game falls more into the bullet-hell style of shooter, the ARPG mechanics, particularly the loot, are very reminiscent of the ever-popular Diablo franchise. And as a huge Diablo fan, thats definitely a good thing.The story premise for Drifting Lands is relatively basic, youre banded together with a group of independents and mercs, featuring drama and conflict when it comes to leadership and overall goals. The actual plot is a little light and not very flashy, so much so that it failed to capture my attention very well. The story progresses via dialogue boxes and still characters placed against different backgrounds, so theres a little lacking in the overall presentation.But, ideally, youre not coming to Drifting Lands for the plot. Instead, youll easily be impressed with the diverse amount of loot and customization options at your disposal. The game features three different ship classes, and a number of slots to equip gear between each ship. Gear has different degrees of rarity, which in turn will grant additional bonus stats as you move up in tiers. To go along with that, you can spend in-game currency to enhance three core skills, which also dictates what gear you can equip. Finally, there are a number of special skills you can equip, essentially allowing you to create a number of various builds centered around defense, evasion, melee, and so on. This is clearly the best aspect of Drifting Lands, and works really well within a shoot-em up shell.Unfortunately, the action shooter side of the game is a little less impressive. The controls are fine, youll have little issue navigating your diminutive ship around enemy bullets as the stage scrolls sideways. Depending on your skill builds, you can either deflect bullets, engage temporary invincibility, slow down time, and so on. The various skills definitely help to keep the combat feel fresh, but it wasnt enough to keep me completely entertained.Enemy ships fly in from various directions as you move forward, and the game seems to procedurally generate the enemies youll encounter. So if you re-do a stage for whatever reason, youll not seem the same waves over and over again. The enemy ship designs are solid, and will change their attack patterns up as you play, which in turn will keep you on your toes. But the biggest drawback for me is the really bland stage design and lack of significant boss fights.", "date": "June 22, 2017", "grade": "B"}
