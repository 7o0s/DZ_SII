As someone who loves word games, how could I not? Its their specialty, so any time they release a new game, I always instantly devour it.The problem with this, of course, is that my biggest complaint about their games is almost invariably that they dont last long enough. But, obviously, how could they not? If Im tearing through every word puzzle a game has to offer, then clearly it wont last me that long.When it comes to Letterbox by POWGI, however, I feel like this is a complaint most people will have. While its a word game, its also a logic game in which youre given a grid surrounded by letters, and another nine-letter word, and you need to place all nine of those letters in the grid in a way that spells a bunch of five-letter words.Now, as much as I love word games, I usually struggle with logic puzzles. But not in this case: while Letterbox featured one or two puzzles that left me staring blankly at the screen, there were many more that I was instantly able to solve in under thirty seconds.Like, many, many more. As in, so many that I completed the whole game in well under an hour.Id like to think that this is because Im some linguistic supergenius, but Im pretty sure thats not the case. More likely, Letterbox just isnt that difficult.Which, in turn, makes it hard for me to recommend a game that I doubt many people will put more than an hour or so into, which has no replay value at all. I enjoyed Letterbox by POWGI in my brief time with it, and I imagine that any word nerd who can hold out until the game is on sale will have a fun hour or so with it, but unless that describes you perfectly, you can safely skip this game.", "date": "October 26, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
