Otherwise, youll start playing one  Revenant Dogma, in this case  and itll easily blend into the last one you played (say, a couple of weeks ago), and the fact that its the same kind of retro-looking RPG as all the other Kemco RPGs will make it awfully hard to differentiate it from all the others in your head.Actually, thats not true. Revenant Dogma stands out from the other Kemco RPGs by the sheer volume of story it contains. Whereas most other Kemco RPGs just start off with one paint-by-numbers story, Revenant Dogma has two lengthy cutscenes in its first hour: one to set the stage, and then another one about a half-hour in that re-explains everything it just told you. Its not that the story is all that complicated  warring races, enemies forced to co-exist, etc.  its just that the game really likes its exposition.Beyond that, Revenant Dogma is pretty much exactly what youd expect. Turn-based battles (now in 2.5D!), graphics that owe a heavy debt to the era of 8- and 16-bit gaming, a useless map that gives you a vague idea of where to go next  if youve played literally any of the many, many other Kemco RPGs, youll find this looks awfully familiar.That said, its good to see that Revenant Dogma continues its predecessors tradition of having characters who arent totally loathsome and who seem to like each other. Maybe its just the games Ive played, but a lot of the time when youre managing parties, it seems like the game goes out of its way to make everyone as obnoxious as possible, both individually and towards each other. By contrast, while the characters in Revenant Dogma arent all best friends, their interactions are generally characterized by humour and camaraderie.Admittedly, the good-natured dialogue isnt enough to lift Revenant Dogma out of the realm of your standard RPG  not when such hefty portions of it are devoted to telling instead of showing. But thats Kemco for you: RPGs that do little things here and there very well, but that, on the whole, dont do anything spectacular.", "date": "December 27, 2018", "grade": "C+"}
