As far as I can tell, its for fans of the Broken Sword series who wish that those games took themselves way less seriously and included way, way more scatalogical humour.In other words, its a niche within a niche. And as someone with only a passing knowledge of the Broken Sword franchise  and only slightly more familiarity with the point and click adventure genre as a whole  Im not going to pretend for a moment that its the sort of thing Id actively seek out if I werent writing for Gaming Age. And yet, in spite of thatOkay, I cant say that Im fond of Demetrios. But I can say that I have a certain kind of respect for how clearly it lays out its creators vision, and sticks with it no matter how many strange places that may take it. Demetrios is just the work of one man, Fabrice Breton, and you can tell that he set out to make a game that he himself would want to play, with other peoples enjoyment being a secondary concern.I know that sounds like a backhanded compliment, but its not meant to be  at least, not entirely. It takes guts, for example, to be willing to make a game in which every single character, from main character on down, is incredibly obnoxious. Most games would try to at least make one or two people sympathetic, but not Demetrios. No, every single character in Demetrios is a sarcastic, obnoxious jerk. While that may mean that spending 10 or so hours with them in this game isnt all that appealing, theres no denying that its a bold design choice.The same goes for everything else in this game. The humour comes off as a mix of edgy sitcom insults coupled with lots of poop jokes. Again, not something that appeals to me in the slightest, but if youre into that sort of thing, youll be well-served by whats on offer here. Likewise, the graphics are somewhat crude, but they fit in with Demetrios general auteur vibe.Im a little less willing to forgive some aspects of this games approach to problem-solving. I know that adventure games are often built around the concept of finding bizarre items and combinations to help you solve all kinds of puzzles. The problem here, however, is that too often the objects are a little too small to find, and the combinations are a little lacking in intuitiveness. If you cant? spot a hint cookie unless you randomly happen to stumble across it, or you dont think to match deodorant and an ice cube to get ice cream, then youll spend a lot of time in this game clicking around and hoping for the best.", "date": "March 13, 2017", "grade": "B-"}
