I feel like that sentence alone tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the game. Just about the only surprising thing about the game is when you find out that the developer behind it isnt from Japan, but rather from Portland.Anyway, just in case youre not sold on/disgusted by the game, the very first choice you have to make is whether to have Syrup, the titular owner of the candy shop, give in to the candy girls pleading to eat her. Remarkably, it doesnt come off as dirty as it reads (though its not not dirty), largely because it  like everything else in the game  is insanely cutesy and twee. Thats not a complaint, nor is it praise, simply an observation.This is praise, though: Syrup and the Ultimate is pretty enjoyable, for what it is. The games various plots are engaging  and short  enough that they do a good job of keeping your attention, and despite the fact the game seems to be part of some fictional universe created by the developer, you dont need any knowledge of the characters in order to follow along.Its also evident that a lot of love and care went into the creation of the game. On top of the decently-realized characters, the game looks almost hand drawn, and you can tell that the developer has affection for everything you see on the screen.None of that, of course, will be enough to interest anyone whos put off by visual novels or extreme quirk. But if you can put up with both of those things, Syrup and the Ultimate Sweet is a pleasant way to pass an hour or so.", "date": "January 6, 2021", "grade": "B"}
