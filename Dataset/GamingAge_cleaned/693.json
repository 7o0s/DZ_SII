Theyve now released their second game, Mecho Tales, and I suppose the good news is that theres no but to be found.Of course, this is because theres only bad news to be found: Mecho Tales is both a pain to play and an even bigger pain to look at.Admittedly, its possible that theres room for disagreement on the graphics side of things. Different people have different tastes, and Mecho Tales rather, er, vivid visual sensibilities might appeal for some, particularly if they want a break from the often drab palettes of many other games. Personally, though, I think the game  with its love of neon pastels  is an eyesore. Colours that have no business being anywhere near each other are smashed together here, and the net effect is literally painful to look at. Sure, its not a style you see in most places, but theres a reason for that: its hideous.I dont think many (or any) would disagree, however, that the gameplay is pretty bad. The controls are incredibly awkward, and the characters are difficult to manoeuvre. Your character is wandering around with a floating turret next to him, and in theory, youre supposed to use the turret to fire at enemies. What actually happens  at least on the Vita  is that its basically impossible to run away from enemies and shoot at them at the same time. Mecho Tales asks you to move your character with the left stick, aim your fire with the right stick, and jump with the right shoulder button. Unless youre nimble enough to simultaneously press down on the shoulder button with your index finger while also moving your right thumbstick in all directions, you wont be able to do what the game asks you to do.", "date": "October 31, 2017", "grade": "D-"}
