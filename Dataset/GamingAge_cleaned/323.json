In a year where Ive played several games that felt like weird lost games from the PS1 era, its probably stranger than all of them put together.It starts out so relatively normal, too. You read a bit of text from an AI computer trying to decontaminate itself, you enter a blocky, polygon-y world, you find a code, then you go back and enter the code into a terminal. Totally straightforward. And then everything flies wildly off the railspossibly in a good way? But possibly not. Its kind of hard to tell.Whats more, I cant even  and dont want to  fully explain why or how it flies off the rails: since its so short and so strange, it feels like it would be a spoiler to reveal much of anything about it. All I know is one moment youre reading text and the next youre walking through a world thats literally falling apart and breaking up around you, and it gets so bad that you feel like you need to restart your Switch just to be sure it hasnt actually broken. Whatever game you think you might be getting into based on its screenshots, I can assure you: its not that.But The Enigma Machine is worth playing. Youll need to be in the mood for something very short, and very weird, but in the end, youll be left with a game that leaves you thinking about it for a while afterwards.", "date": "November 8, 2022", "grade": "B"}
