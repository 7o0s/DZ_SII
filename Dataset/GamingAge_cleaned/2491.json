Dreamscaper is one of those games for me.Or, in simpler terms: its not you, Dreamscaper, its me.Like, I fully acknowledge that theres a lot of neat stuff going on in this game. Its a gorgeous, thought-provoking isometric action roguelike that has a much deeper, much more personal story than youd get in most games of this genre  if not most games, period. But no matter how much I play it, I cant get into it.Obviously, though, I wouldnt fault anyone who does like it. As I said in the last paragraph, there are all kinds of things about Dreamscaper that make it worth recommending. For starters, its got a lot more depth than your typical roguelike  and not just in terms of the gameplay. The story is built around one young womans battle with depression, sadness, and other negative emotions, and you increase your stats not just by battling monsters, but by getting her out into the world to meditate, or draw, or develop relationships. Its not the typical stuff of action games.Even so, Dreamscaper still has some pretty solid action. The game gives you plenty of ways to attack enemies, while also requiring that you develop solid evasion and blocking techniques. As youd expect from a game where youre literally battling depression, you cant just hack and slash your way through the game and expect to make it anywhere. Dreamscaper very much falls into the category of easy to pick up/very hard to master.And, of course, Dreamscaper is absolutely gorgeous. As befits a game that takes place in dreams  where you go to battle the monsters of sadness and loss  the whole thing has a dreamlike quality, with the edges of each room barely sketched in. In fact, even when the heroine is awake, the game still retains a half-awake, otherworldly feeling thanks to its graphics.Yet, despite all these good qualities, I still cant get into Dreamscaper. But, because of all these good qualities, I totally get why others might be able to. Its not my cup of tea, but if you like a well-made roguelike, its very likely that it will be yours.", "date": "November 18, 2021", "grade": "B"}
