{"name": "Amazon Fire TV (2nd Generation)", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/10/amazon-fire-tv-2nd-generation-review/", "text": "One and a half years ago, we reviewed theAmazonFire TVa device that had A Lot of Problems, yet A Lot of Potential. Given the incremental nature of the hardware update, so too will this be an incremental review that will explore whats improved, what still needs improved, and whats new. Its recommended to take a gander atthe first-generation Fire TV reviewto best contextualize things.From the first moment, Amazons consistency in the out of box experience is evident. Step for step equal to the previousFire TVmodel, including (at time of review) the introduction video, there are zero surprises. The box-seal unzips, the appliance plugs into a television, hold the remotes Home Button, select a language, connect to Wi-Fi, log into an Amazon accountits all a clinic in first-use experience.With a new model also comes a new processor and graphics combo, purportedly75% faster than the previous edition. During use, its easy to believe. While the first edition bogs down a bit sometimes, the newsolution breezes through menus and voice commands with minimal lag. This is a bit more exciting with voice commands being slightly expanded (and rebranded) asAlexa,a search that gives a fewSiri-like options.Also welcome in the new unit, stemming from an update that came halfway through the previous models lifespan, is expandable memory. 8GB isnt a huge amount of memory when games come into the picture, and flash drives can be slow and dont mesh with the clean lines of the unit, so a MicroSD card slot is an exciting addition.Other minor improvements are seen in the new units materials. Soft touch plastic is gone, replaced with a far more typical and far less fingerprint-magnetic standard plastic. The remote is a slight bit larger, lighter, and purportedly has a longer battery life due to Wi-Fi direct replacing bluetooth. A gaming controller (still a few days away, and will be reported on when it releases) has reportedly seen similar improvements.In every single point of the unit Amazon can directly control, theyve improved.Then you get into the app ecosystem. Compatibility between the first and second edition is still spotty, with several games not yet being updated for the new Fire TV until nearly a week post-release. Some major titles are still in limbo. Some apps still refer to a touchscreen or the voice remote, ignoring the controller. Its still a bit of a mess, but a big step above where the ecosystem started.", "date": "October 11, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
