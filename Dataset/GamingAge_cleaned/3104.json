Very, very darkand, unfortunately, not dark in the way its creators probably intended.See, Shadows 2 is a horror game. Those, of course, are expected to be dark, both thematically and in terms of lighting. And while the setting of Shadows 2 certainly lends itself to both  its set in a dimly-lit hotel, where two characters are first investigating and then fleeing monsters that show up on the security cam footage  the reality is that the whole thing is so literally dark youll have trouble seeing any of it, which negates the scares significantly. Some of this is intended, I think. After all, youre controlling a pair of security guards who have only crappy flashlights to illuminate their ways, and anything outside the flashlights beam is intended to be invisible. Done well, this could lend itself to some pretty tense situations  and, admittedly, sometimes it does just that. You never know when youre going to turn around and find yourself starting at the dimly-lit outline of a hulking monster.Unfortunately, more often than not, youll find yourself squinting at the screen, trying to figure out exactly what it is youre looking at. Even with the brightness turned all the way up, most of the time I had trouble seeing anything. And its not like what I could see was that much better: the side effect of having only a narrow beam of light guiding your way is that you have to focus on whats being illuminated, which in turn makes you realize how terrible the graphics are in Shadows 2. This is a pretty ugly game  and again, not ugly in the way that good horror can be ugly, but rather just plain ugly.", "date": "January 10, 2020", "grade": "C"}
