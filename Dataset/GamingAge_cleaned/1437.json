Its basically a joke game, born  if Wikipedia is to be believed  out of one mans desire to teach his colleagues how to use Unreal Engine, and turned into a full-on game because of love for a funny fake trailer. Judging it by the same standards youd apply to most other games seems like an exercise in missing the point. And yet, here the game is on Xbox, after having been to a huge hit on PC, which means that its not unfair to ask the question of whether theres any reason to spend real, actual money on something that looks like it never shouldve gone beyond the Heh, thats funny stage.Actually, the question is, Is Goat Simulator any good? And the answer isits far better than it has any right to be.I mean, its not the kind of game you could sit down and just play for hours. No matter how much the developers tried to gamify being a goat  with things like trophies and minigames scattered around the world, and objectives for each level  the reality is youre just running around as an indestructible goat in a world full of very breakable and explosive objects.That said, if youre like me, the latter half of that last sentence might be more than enough to pique and sustain your interest. My favourite things in gaming include a healthy sense of absurdity and the ability to cause massive explosions, and those are the two areas in which Goat Simulator excels. In terms of the latter, all you need to do to make a car explode is brush against it, and the resulting blast will be enough to launch you across the city. On a related note, the ragdoll animations here are fantastic, with every person you come into contact with prone to flopping over or flying away with only the slightest contact, regardless of whether its caused by a headbutt or a bit of wayward debris.As you probably expect, Goat Simulators sense of humor is equally over the top. This is a game where one of the power-ups is becoming Goat Satan, which you obtain by accessing a barely-hidden portal to Hell and which allows you to summon dead goats on command. No less absurd are the mutations that give you accessories like a wearable pitching machine, a jetpack, and, uh, Deadmau5s head, the last of which allows you to instantly start a dance party wherever you go.In other words, its all incredibly silly. Its also not particularly deep  so again, if youre looking for something you can play for hours and hours, this probably isnt it. I mean, everything about the game appeals to me, and I could only take it in half-hour increments, so I cant imagine how it would be for someone who isnt in love with the concept. Goat Simulator isnt exactly the kind of game thats going to win over people who are already suspicious that its just one big joke.", "date": "May 14, 2015", "grade": "B"}
