I wasnt really into non-sports video games until well into the current console generation, which means that my experience with the series has basically been limited to playing the first one on my PSP as a PS1 classic, and then playing the awful HD collection that came out earlier this year. Im obviously aware of the series significance, but I certainly dont have any strong opinions on it one way or another.In other words, Im either the absolute worst persion to be writing about Silent Hill: Book of Memories, since I dont know how much WayForward desecrated a once-proud franchise, or the best, since my perceptions of the game arent burdened by expectations of what it should be. The more I play the game, though, the more I wish that did have expectations to be dashed, since then I might have an opinion that goes beyond Silent Hill: Book of Memories is a game that exists.Thats probably the best and worst that can be said of Silent Hills Vita debut. Its not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but its not a great one, either. Its competently made, and its sure to have people who enjoy it. At the same time, however, if youve played one level, youve basically played them all  outside of the boss fights, the gameplay here doesnt vary much from hacking and slashing your way through rooms, and then solving a puzzle to progress to the next level.That said, I dont want to be too down on Silent Hill: Book of Memories; quiet competence is a severely underrated quality. Besides, while it may not be the most ambitious game, it does what it wants to do extremely well. It reimagines survival horror in a way thats well-suited to pick-up-and-play handheld gaming sessions. You probably wouldnt want to crawl your way through the various dungeons (or, if you want to be precise, haunted mansions/villages/giant spooky complexes) for any extended period of time, but in short bursts, hacking and slashing your way through the monsters that inhabit the game can be fun.Its important to emphasize that phrase, short bursts. Whats enjoyable for fifteen or twenty minutes can easily turn into a slog for longer. While I have no doubt that fans of endless grinding would love extended Silent Hill: Book of Memories sessions, particularly if they can find people to play online with (which, sadly, I could not), after awhile it all started blurring together for me. Even if the enemies start getting more complex and challenging the further in you get, the basic gameplay and presentation (top down, isometric action, just so were clear) never varies.", "date": "November 27, 2012", "grade": "B-"}
