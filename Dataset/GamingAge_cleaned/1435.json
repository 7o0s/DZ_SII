Lots of referential gaming jokesblah blah blahthe game doesnt just straddle the line between mocking fanservice and indulging in it, it pogos constantly from one side to the otheryadda yadda yaddayou fight Pac-Man ghosts and Tetris pieces and on and on and on. Basically, you could almost take my last review, of Hyperdevotion Noire, and just sub in this title for that one.Theres one key reason why you cant do that, though: because, since its a spin-off Hyperdimension Neptunia game rather than a mainline one, Hyperdimension Neptunia U is actually interesting and fun to play. Much like Hyperdevotion Noire and Hyperdimension Neptunia: Producing Perfection before it, Hyperdimension Neptunia U takes the series standard JRPG formula and shows how much more interesting it can be when its applied to a non-JRPG game.In this case, Hyperdimension Neptunia U finds the franchise trying its hand at Dynasty Warriors-style action. This means, of course, endlessly hacking and slashing your way through dungeons full of enemies andwell thats it. Taking a cue from Dynasty Warriors, this game doesnt bog you down in tactics or special powers, but instead allows you to focus all your energies on wiping out hundreds of enemies at a time with 1,000+ hit combos. Its a little repetitive, sure, but its also pretty fun.Not only that, Hyperdimension Neptunia Us developers seem to have taken an equally minimalist approach to story. Even though the game features about ten main characters, theyve streamlined everything so that youre not getting bogged down in the kind of hard-to-follow nonsense that typifies the mainline Hyperdimension Neptunia games. Theres not massive wars or fights for the future of Gamindustri here; instead, youre presented with a plot about two game industry journalists  Famitsu and Dengekiko  competing to see who can come up with a better story about the games other main charactersand thats it. You can occasionally take time from fighting to watch snippets of dialogue between the main main characters and their sisters, but even then its all in the service of that one main plot. Unlike the other games (excluding Producing Perfection), you dont really need to know much else about the characters. Its kind of refreshing, considering how much backstory you need to know in order to play the other games in the franchise.By streamlining things, Hyperdimension Neptunia U makes it possible to actually notice and appreciate its jokes  which is an important thing, seeing as the whole series is designed to be one big spoof of the gaming industry. You can notice things like the Sonic and Mario references, and the Kinect skewering, and the way it makes fun of Compile Heart and Idea Factory  and, yes, of many of the people who play these games. We may not be talking about Portal-level humour here, but, at the very least, its still nice to be able to read the dialogue without wondering about all the different subtexts youre missing.Of course, if theres a criticism to be made against the game, its that it continues the series long tradition of trying to have its cake and eat it too. Sure, Hyperdimension Neptunia U makes winking references to the way people expect to see flimsy clothing coming flying off during the heat of battle, which means even they see how ridiculous games like Senran Kagura are  yet at the same time, when your characters sustain enough damage in battle, their clothes come flying off too, and youre treated to lingering shots of the characters jiggly bits. I mean, its great that they acknowledge the absurdity, and at least here you have option of unlocking untearable outfits, but it still feels like theyre trying to have it both ways. Then again, thats one more way than these games usually feature. And more importantly, the game takes such pleasure in mocking every other aspect of gaming, it deserves at least a bit of a pass.", "date": "May 19, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
