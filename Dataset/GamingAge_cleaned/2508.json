{"name": "Cruisn Blast", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/10/cruisn-blast-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Cruisn Blast is the latest Cruisn game, made by Raw Thrills.Now, Ill be honest: that sentence didnt mean a lot to me going into the game. But if youre the type of person who spent a lot of time in arcades growing up, that may tell you a whole lot. The Cruisn series was launched by Midway Games in arcades decades ago and has periodically found a home on certain Nintendo consoles, while Raw Thrills was founded by the guy who created Cruisn. So you can see why its pedigree is actually pretty impressive.Just as impressive: this game.Seriously, its one of the best  or at least one of the most enjoyable  racing games Ive ever played. As someone who loves games like Burnout and Split/Second for the destruction and Mario Kart for the crazy tracks, I have to say that both of those particular itches were scratched during my time with Cruisn Blast.Its just so much fun. Every track is a crazy thrillride that pops off the screen, as you speed through neon-soaked worlds, weaving in between dinosaur legs, dodging cops, swerving around airplanes, and plummeting through crumbling roads onto conveniently placed tracks below. You launch yourself through the air on ramps, you hit the nitro to fly around corners, and you pick up cash to upgrade your ride  all set to an irresistibly pulsating soundtrack.Is it deep? Heck no. And realistically, unless you have a few friends over to try out the local-only multiplayer, you probably wont get more than a weekend out of this game.But what a weekend that would be. Cruisn Blast is arcade racing in its absolute best form imaginable, and if you want a racing game that leaves you grinning like an idiot the entire time youre playing it, I couldnt recommend it any more highly.", "date": "October 29, 2021", "grade": "A"}
