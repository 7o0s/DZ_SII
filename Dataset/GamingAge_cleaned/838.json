{"name": "Dying: Reborn", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/05/dying-reborn-review-ps4-ps-vita/", "text": "According to Metacritic, Dying: Reborn is the worst PS4 game of the year. This is probably overstating the games awfulness.After all, many of those other reviews are judging the game based on its PSVR version, which apparently was less a full game, and more a disjointed tech demo. Luckily, for the non-VR version Dying: Reborns creators sought to remedy that flaw by giving the game a proper story. Admittedly, its a story that, near as I can tell, borrows heavily from the Saw franchise  the first trophy is called I Want to Play a Game with You, which sounds like Lets play a game run through Google Translate  but its a story nonetheless.With a plot in place, its a lot easier to see what Oasis Games were going for: an escape room-based adventure game. You start off in one room, find a bunch of items, solve a series of puzzles, and then move on to the next room. Repeat that a few times, and youve got yourself a game. Not a very long game, not a very original game, but a coherent game nonetheless.Thats the good news.The bad news is that the execution still leaves something to be desired. For starters, Dying: Reborns story is told partly via extremely bad voice acting, and partly via text that, like the aforementioned first trophy, sounds like it was run through Google Translate a few times. The former is, as youd imagine, extremely grating, while the latter lessens its intended impact by forcing you to piece together exactly what the creators meant to say. Combine the two, and youre left with an adventure game in which the adventure isnt very compelling.Likewise, as youre unraveling the games mystery by uncovering clues and solving puzzles, youre moving at a snails pace. Given that all you do in this game is walk slowly from one place to another, solving pretty easy puzzles, you can see how this quickly becomes annoying.", "date": "May 22, 2017", "grade": "C-"}
