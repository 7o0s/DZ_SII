{"name": "Shu", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/07/shu-review-ps-vita-ps4-pc/", "text": "When it comes to reviewing Shu, its tempting to repeat what I wrote just a few days ago about Skylar & Plux, and simply subbing in 2D platformer everywhere I wrote 3D platformer. After all, my basic feelings about both games are pretty similar: theyre both short, and they both do things relatively well within the confines of their genre.However, theres a big difference, and not just in terms of the number of dimensions: Skylar & Plux stood out for simply being competent at what it did, without doing anything spectacularly well. Shu, by contrast, does some things exceedingly well.Admittedly, much of this is simply cosmetic. Shu is a very pleasant-looking  some might even say cute  game. The characters are delightful, from the adorable main character to all his little friends; even the villains and dangers are liable to make you say, Awww. Likewise, the music strikes a good balance between being frenetic enough to get you to keep going, while at the same time not being so obtrusive that it harshes the overall friendly vibe.But its more than just aesthetics. The controls feel fairly tight, which is important considering theres the odd part where you need to move with a bit of urgency. Shus world is also designed pretty nicely  the levels are fairly lengthy, and theyre all full of secrets and treasures just waiting to be uncovered. To bring things back to what I was saying just a few lines up, some games have big worlds, but forget to fill them with things; thats not a problem here.", "date": "July 21, 2017", "grade": "A-"}
