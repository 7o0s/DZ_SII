Maybe Ive been made cynical by HD collections and remasters that dont look much improved from their original versions, but its nice to see a game get the HD treatment and for once have the phrase mean something.This is particularly important when were talking about a game that originally came out on the Wii. Nothing against that system, but it wasnt exactly a graphics powerhouse. So to see that Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD is one of the brightest, shiniest, prettiest games Ive come across in awhile is a very pleasant surprise. The game is bursting with life in every screen, particularly in the main campaign mode, and it gives Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD a fun, happy-go-lucky vibe.Its ironic, then, that Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD isnt actually all that fun. Simply put: its got brutal controls, and the difficulty curve is quite steep. Add those two things together, and you can see why youre more likely to be tossing your controller in frustration than you are to be bopping along to the upbeat soundtrack.Youd think that this wouldnt be the case, that even though some critics of the original game lamented the games challenging controls, the move from the Wii and its motion controls to a proper controller would make moving your monkey around a little easier. But this isnt the case at all. For some reason, even though you have two thumbsticks at your disposal, the game only allows you to use one. In a 3D world, where you regularly have to make sharp turns and it would be very useful to see where you want to go, you can see why this would be a huge pain. Its very difficult to roll with any kind of precision  even though there are plenty of levels that demand just that. Couple that with a very limited amount of lives, and suddenly the smiling monkey faces seem more taunting than anything else.There are also 10 mini-games, whittled down from the 50 that were found on the Wii version of the game. While Ill admit I didnt get the full experience, since theyre all meant to be party games and I played them solo. Nonetheless, none of them blew me away. The rolling games suffer from the same issues as the main game. The Super Monkey Ball-themed shmup/space shooter is dull. Im still not sure why anyone would want to take part in hurdles, but thats here too. Basically, the mini-games are here if you want them, but I dont know why you would.I get why you might want Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD as a whole, though. Itll hit the right nostalgia buttons for some people, and the bright colours are sure to attract others. Unless they have a high tolerance for iffy controls and a steep learning curve, however, theyll soon realize that looks are very deceiving.", "date": "October 29, 2019", "grade": "B"}
