The latter is, of course, excellent; the former, absolutely dreadful. Still, when the choice is awful versus so-so, the mediocre game wins out every time.Obviously, thats not meant to be a glowing endorsement. Under the Jolly Roger started life as a mobile game a few years ago called Tempest: Pirate Action RPG, before making the jump to PS4 in early 2020 with the simpler name of Tempest. Now its on the Switch under its current nameand, well, it feels very much like a mobile game from a couple of years ago, with awkward controls, shallow battle systems, and not a whole lot of depth all around.But even if it doesnt do anything incredibly well, its also not horrible by any stretch of the imagination. It promises Open World Pirate Action, and you more or less get that. You can sail the seas, fighting whatever ships you come across and docking wherever the wind takes you to get supplies and more crew. The naval battles very much feel like those in Black Flag, and they augment them with fun (if simplistic) swordplay as you board enemy ships. And, as a bonus, unlike a lot of other mobile refugees, Under The Jolly Roger doesnt have any glaring seams where the monetization used to be back when the game was on iOS.The problem is that none of it leads anywhere. Theres no deeper story driving you along, so you just sail around doing the same activities over and over again. Its certainly enjoyable enough for a little while, but its not too long before you start craving a bit more depth.Which is why, as I said above, Under the Jolly Roger is best described as so-so. As mobile ports go, Ive certainly seen a lot worse, but if you want something deeper, keep looking (or, of course, just get Black Flag instead).", "date": "February 3, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
