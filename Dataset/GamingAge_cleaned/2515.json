{"name": "Killer Dolls United", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/10/killer-dolls-united-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "As I wrote about Witchcrafty a few weeks back, Ive tried to be generous in how I approach the last batch of games to ever come out on the Vita. By all accounts, it sounds like developers were given very little notice about the Vita stores closure, which undoubtedly meant that plenty of corners were cut in the rush to get games out the door under the final deadline.Even judging by that very lenient standard, however, theres no denying that Killer Dolls United, another of the Vitas last games, is utterly abysmal.Like, its probably not quite the worst game the Vita received in its final year  that dubious honour still goes to Gods of Almagest. But its a sign of how terrible Killer Dolls United is that its a very close race between the two.Its hard to even write a sentence about this game without veering off into incredulous mockery almost immediately. Case in point: Killer Dolls United is a hack & slash arena game where you control one of the titular Killer Dolls as she gets chased around a small room byzombies, possibly? Theyre vaguely humanoid shapes, and I think I may have seen nipples on some of them, but they walk haltingly and dont seem to do much apart from occasionally lumber in your direction, so, really, the specifics of the monsters probably dont matter all that much.The game struggles with pretty much everything, to be brutally honest, but it fares worst when it comes to performance. It should come as no surprise that the game visibly strains under the weight of trying to show more than a couple of enemies on screen at any given time  which is a drawback, seeing as were talking about a game where you face successive waves of hordes. Whats moderately surprising, though, is that the game doesnt even work well when theres literally nothing else on the screen apart from your character. Like, even though the edges of the screen are dim and the only thing moving is your Killer Doll, shell take a few stepsthen freezethen unfreeze for a few more stepsthen freeze again.In fact, stuttering and general poor performance arent limited to the gameplay, either. I quickly learned not to pause mid-wave, since doing so basically crashed the game. Likewise, I never knew when the game would recognize if I pressed a menu button, since it seemed to be completely random, which meant Id press something several times and, at some point, get lucky and be able to move on to the next screen..Though lucky may be the wrong word there, since it meant I was one step closer to playing one of the worst games Ive ever experienced.And, really, I dont think Killer Dolls United even deserves a qualifying statement like the one I gave to Witchcrafty in the review linked in the first paragraph. The studio that made this game was also responsible for 2018s The Dreamlands, which was also marked by being appallingly putrid in every way imaginable. Killer Dolls United continues that trend, but is somehow even worse. Its a bad game, and even if youre a Vita completionist like me, its one you should strongly consider skipping.", "date": "October 25, 2021", "grade": "F"}
