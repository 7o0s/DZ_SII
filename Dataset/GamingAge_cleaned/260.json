{"name": "Death Mark", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/03/death-mark-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "As far as Im concerned, no game genre does horror quite like visual novels. I may just feel that way because I absorb things best when I read them, but to me, series like Corpse Party and Danganronpa are better at instilling dread and terror in players than any number of shambling, shooting zombie games. Because of the fact they can hide their disgusting gore behind words, rather than showing everything, theyve always gotten away with things that no 3D survival horror game would even dream of.Unsurprisingly, you can add Death Mark to that list. As youve probably gathered, its a visual novel, andwell, lets just say it earns its M rating. Its got death and monsters, of course, but its also got dismemberment, rape, violence, child abuse, suicide: name some terrible, messed-up thing, and chances are good youll encounter it in this game somewhere.Whether all of it is necessary is a good question  particularly when it comes to some of its more detailed descriptions (and depictions) of female characters. Like many horror films, theres an air of misogyny hanging around Death Mark thats pretty hard to miss, and it becomes more apparent the more times you see scantily-clad murder victims.That said, this game would still be creepy even if it never showed a single oddly-positioned woman dressed only in lingerie. Death Mark is built around a man investigating a mysterious mark thats appeared on his arm thats turned out to be a harbinger of death for anyone who has it  hence the games name  and it knows how to draw the tension inherent in that premise out for every little bit that its worth. This is obvious right from the opening moments, when youre looking around a dark mansion trying to find some answers, and you come across a lifesize doll and a ticking clock. As you progress through the chapters, discovering objects that help you solve mysteries, you never know when your wandering flashlight is going to uncover a face hiding in a window or the outline of a child crouched under the stairs.The game ratchets up the tension even further when you actually encounter enemies. Sometimes this takes the form of sections where you live or die depending on how you answer a ghosts question: as the time ticks away, the game tests how closely youve been paying attention, and its sure to get your blood pumping. Elsewhere, this means  rather improbably  turn-based boss fights to close off every chapter. They dont totally fit in with the rest of the games vibe, but at the same time, its an interesting way of making sure players dont just zoom through the narrative.Death Mark also makes some interesting design choices in a more literal sense. The graphics are much less uniform than what you usually see in Japanese visual novels. While many of the scenes look every bit like youd expect, with characters sliding on and off screen as dialogue demands, elsewhere the scenes look like something out of a painting. Given how closely games of this type usually hew to a specific aesthetic, its a breath of fresh air to see it break out of that mold every once in awhile.Its actually kind of ironic to be describing anything in Death Mark as a breath of fresh air, since so much of it seems to stiflingly claustrophobic and dark. But really, thats what it is: where most visual novels seem content, for better or for worse, to stick to a formula, this game does things a little differently, and for the most part, the game is better for it.", "date": "March 4, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
