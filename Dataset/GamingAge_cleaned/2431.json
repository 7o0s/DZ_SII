I mean, Ive played all three of the core Danganronpa games before they got packaged together like this, so its not like Im approaching them from a neutral perspective. Whats more, even though its been years since I played these games, they all stand out in my memory pretty distinctly  for better (if were talking either of the first two games) or for worse (if were talking the third).On top of that, if youre like me and the appeal of Danganronpa Decadence is getting to play the new game here, Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Campwell, I shared my feelings on that a few weeks ago. Short version: I loathed everything about Danganronpa S, from its dull, grinding gameplay to its horrible monetization.All of which is to say: its hard to look at Danganronpa Decadence as a package deal when I know its component pieces so well.That said, a few things stood out for me playing the games again.First, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is still a great game. In fact, if anything its only gotten better with the benefit of hindsight. Even if you go in knowing how gleefully revolting it is  and it feels like it would be hard not to  its still incredible (for lack of a better description) to go back and see it again.For one thing, even though the game is closing in on a decade-old, it still looks incredible. Everything from the insane designs, to the way the game characters and environments literally pop into view, to the splashes of colour all over the screen  the first Danganronpa set a very high standard for the rest of the series that still make it stand out today.Further, its still a pretty riveting game. Danganronpa is what would happen if you crossed Ace Attorney with the Hunger Games (or Battle Royale, depending on your point of reference) with Saw. Its a gleefully amoral, violent, sadistic murder mystery that delights in presenting you with a cast of horrible teenagers, and then doling out punishments to all of them that far exceed their crimes. I dont want to spoil anything, but I will say that its about as bleak and pessimistic a game as you can possibly imagine  it absolutely earns its M rating  but because of how its presented, its impossible not to get sucked in. I mean, youll feel terrible about yourself and the game if you stop and think about it for too long, but its still an unmatched experience.On the flip side, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair isnt quite as amazing as I remember it being. Its still a solid game, but playing it so soon after the first Danganronpa, you really notice how similar the two are. Sure its set on a beach instead of in a school  which, naturally, gives the game more of an opportunity to ramp up its perviness  but the basic gist of it feels more or less the same.Obviously, thats not the worst thing: as we just established, the first Danganronpa is amazing, so getting more of it isnt exactly a punishment. Further, given how successful the first Danganronpa was (by the standards of games that were Vita-exclusive for a very long time), it wouldve been strange for the developers to just abandon that and move on to something else entirely for the sequel. Still, since Danganronpa Decadence is a package deal, playing them one after the other right away makes the similarities feel much more pronounced than they felt when you had a few years between the two games.While the same could be said for Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony, I actually felt much more favourable towards the game now than I did 4+ years ago. While some of those criticisms still hold true  no matter how iconic Monokuma is, having six versions of him as the Monokubs is a bit much  I definitely underestimated just how much knowing the games utterly bonkers ending in advance made me view the game through fresh eyes.Of course, seeing as Danganronpa 3 is a murder mystery at heart, and one of the great things about a murder mystery is not spoiling the ending, you may not want to go in knowing how it all unfolds, in which case much of it will seem like the first two games. That said, the way the story here evolves has enough twists and turns that you cant help but be drawn along.Further, one major point in Danganronpa 2 and 3s favour is that theyre both just as stylish as the first game, but in their own ways. While they may draw inspiration from the first Danganronpa, their settings differ enough that they dont look like carbon copies. Given how long these three games are put together, having a great look is a nice bonus that helps carry you through a lot of it.Truthfully, I dont think that Danganronpa Decadence is the best way to experience the trilogy. These are three very intense games, each with enough crazy twists and over-the-top cruelty and violence that you should probably take a break between each one. One thing that youll be reminded of again and again in each game is that they earn their M ratings beyond a shadow of a doubt. But nonetheless, these are still three of the best games the visual novel genre has to offer, and if youre even remotely interested in playing murder mysteries, theyre all must-plays.Oh, and Danganronpa S? Just to reiterate, it still sucks.", "date": "January 31, 2022", "grade": "A-"}
