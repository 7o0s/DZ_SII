{"name": "Shutshimi", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/09/shutshimi-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Heres how I know Shutshimi is a great game: because I really, really enjoyed it.Thats actually no small feat. See, Shutshimi is a shmup, a genre Ive never particularly liked. I dont hate them with a burning passion or anything, they just usually bore me. I liked both Velocity games on the Vita, but beyond that, Ive had a tough time getting into them, no matter how well made they are.Until Shutshimi, that is. Turns out my main problem with shmups is that I just didnt have the attention span to take on wave after wave of enemies. Make each level ten seconds long, though  as Shutshimi does  and suddenly I cant get enough of it. Ill gladly play through level after level until I die, and then Ill start over all again as soon as I can. If thats not the definition of an addictive game that even appeals to people who dont normally like the genre, I dont know what is.Its not just ultra-short levels that made Shutshimi so appealing, though. Itswell, everything. The way it crams an insane amount of action into those ten second levels, making it move so quickly you barely even get a chance to think about what youre doing. The incredibly varied enemies, ranging from kittens in space ships to sharks with laser beams attached to their heads to squids that are, uh, plain old squids. The way it dispenses power-ups, giving you ten seconds to choose between a few option, all of which are accompanied by funny text, many of which dont, in fact, help you that much (though pick enough hats and you get a trophy out of it, if thats your thing). The fact the main characters are all fish with giant, muscular arms.And, of course, there are the weapons. Some of them  lasers, machine guns  are exactly what youd expect in a shmup. Others, like the shotgun, make a little less sense when you actually think about them, particularly since they require you to get up close and personal with the enemies if you want them to work. Lastly, though, you have a category of weapons that dont fit in with the genre, but do fit in with the games off-the-wall sensibilities  things like cannon balls and gobs of mucus that are totally absurd, but work in the context of Shutshimi because it makes it clear from the get-go that its willing to go wherever its insane muse takes it.", "date": "September 10, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
