{"name": "Draugen", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/04/draugen-review-for-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "If nothing else, Draugens creators have pretty solid taste. The game is an artsy walking simulator, and it borrows liberally from some of the very best games the genre has to offer: theres a bit of Dear Esther here, a dash of Gone Home there, and a helping of What Remains of Edith Finch to top it all off. Given that those are some of my all-time favourite games, it would only make sense if I loved Draugen, too.Unfortunately, I didnt. I mean, I didnt hate it by any means, but Im quite certain that, in a couple of years, I wont be looking back at it with the same reverence I have for games like Edith Finch or Gone Home.A big part of the problem is that it never feels like more than a collection of influences. You can see Dear Esther in the basic premise  a man (and in this case, his companion) exploring a remote island to solve a mystery. You search through the house and learn that something isnt right while piecing together the story  that would be Gone Home. You discover that theres a curse thats impacted everyone on the island  that feels a lot like What Remains of Edith Finch. There are also a couple of pretty significant twists (that Ill get into in a moment) that, while not necessarily taken directly from another game, feel a little too formulaic to have the shock value Draugen clearly intended. Thats not necessarily taken from another specific game, but it still doesnt feel particularly original.It doesnt help that the world doesnt feel all that lived in. Everything looks and feels a little too sterile, and not in a good way. The game limits what you can and cant interact with, and it feels a little random, since some of the objects you can touch dont really add anything to the story. There are invisible walls everywhere, anything more than a step is barely traversable, and the character youre controlling moves awkwardly. If the whole point of the game is its immersive story, its a little self-defeating to throw all these barriers in your way that take you out of the immersion.Mind you, the game isnt helped by the fact that the story isnt great. Even before the big twists  which again, Ill get to in a moment, and which Im holding off discussing for spoiler reasons  everything feels flat and lifeless, perhaps because all of it seems so derivative of other, better games.And as for those twists  one last spoiler alert!  they arent that shocking, and because the story is so derivative, you can spot them coming a mile away. The sister that the main character is searching for? Shes been dead the whole time. And the companion? Just a figment of his imagination. Even if you dont have issues with how Draugen portrays mental illness, it still all feels like a big cop-out, as if the game came up with a cool premise and then had no idea how to flesh it out further.Because it certainly is a cool premise. Draugen starts off really well, between the mysterious island and the search for the missing sister. On top of that, the island feels truly dead, as if no one could possibly live there  which, admittedly, morphs into that aforementioned sterility once you realize theres not much more to the game than what you see, but at first its genuinely creepy. Likewise, the voice acting is okay, too  not incredible by any stretch, but Ive heard worse, even if it starts feeling a little silly post-twist.But its really hard to enjoy Draugen when it all feels like its a collection of nods to other, better games. A game shouldnt make you want to play other games, yet most of the time I spent with Draugen I was wondering about whether it was too soon to go back and play Gone Home or What Remains of Edith Finch. If youve never played those before, this wont seem nearly as derivative  but thats more an argument for playing those other games than it is for playing Draugen.", "date": "April 9, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
