{"name": "PixelJunk SideScroller", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2011/12/review-pixeljunk-sidescroller/", "text": "Writing a review for a game thats great is harder than it seems, because while people are ready to pay attention to a warning and egregious nitpicking about a piece of content, praise can come off as contrived marketing or reading like a well-formed press release thats either boring, derivative, or best of all hyperbolic.Also I never know what to say except that you should just be playing it and enjoying for yourself all the things that I got to find out first-hand before any impressions or demos were available. PixelJunk SideScroller falls into this category because even though you know exactly a sidescrolling shooter is (like the title, get it?), you dont know what clever twist Q-Games has come up with to validate a subversive extension to the two Shooter titles and follow up their finale in PJS2 a section that broke the mold which twin-stick games had been cast over with since Project Gotham Racing 2 brought us Geometry Wars in favor of classic sensibilities. Not only did it step back at least a generation, but it felt great.What Im saying is that youre stupid if you waited as long to read this review for an opinion on PixelJunk SideScroller as I did to finally write it.Q-Games makes us all feel smart, however, by providing 13 levels of challenging shmup levels to conquer for a low price of affordable and reasonable that we can buy, own, and play to our hearts content. More importantly, its another successful entry into the PixelJunk series, which means that I dont have to start questioning the future of the PJ pedigree like I did last time when I said that the Shooter franchise was about to run out of steam right quick without some fantastic reasons to make a third. As it turns out, the most fantastic reason yet was to stylize it so far back into the 70s that it looked like an old arcade machine with some modern conveniences.This is where reviewing the came becomes tiresome, because Im bored myself even talking about the gameplay theres nothing new here in any form. Its got hidden collectables, high scores to beat, trophies, enemies, mini and regular bosses, and weapons to level up and rotate between just like youd expect. Everything about the gameplay is exactly what youd expect. Its awesome. You dont need to know anything more than that.More interesting are the visuals, which are a refreshing neon take on the Shooter franchise without drawing too much of a comparison to other games that I already mentioned once, or twice since Im about to say Geometry Wars. Theres also Super laser Racer, and Geometry Wars 2, and Bullet Candy, and Gravity Crash, and some of Beat Hazard. Oh, and a game called Scoregasm. And also Pac-Man CE, and Pac-Man CE DX, and Geospark but whos keeping track? The important thing to notice is the CRT curved overlay laid down to simulate an older tube screen.The real star of the show is one of the chillest soundtracks youll hear all year. The audio work is not only stand-out in PixelJunk SideScroller, but touches like the female V.O. that announces the status changes lines with intentional pronunciations of levelu serve to set a stage of some haunted Japanese arcade machine that had been long forgotten. Modern sensibilities in sound design, coupled with a tongue-in-cheek direction for the game as a whole play a large part in building this stylized world that SideScroller is supposed to exist within, and works on a level that Ive never appreciated more in a PixelJunk game.Enough about all the stupid stuff that I liked. At this point you should be playing SideScroller, because despite it walking a well-worn path down shmup lane, its just as compelling as any of Q-Games more experimental titles. SideScroller should actually be an easier sell, being more traditional, since all you need to know is how much of a baby you are about challenging games and what you can handle. I dont mean games that challenge you to think differently by the way this isnt one of those articles. What I mean is that its not going to be the walk in the park that these arcade revival shooters tend to be, but if youve played one PixelJunk game then youve played them all; each one exercises a simple control scheme which is versatile enough to be tested under an at-times steep difficulty curve.", "date": "December 14, 2011", "grade": "A-"}
