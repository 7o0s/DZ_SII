{"name": "FullBlast", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/11/fullblast-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Theres not really too much to say about FullBlast beyond a) that its a completely generic shmup, and b) that, like Jack N Jill DX and Tetras Escape before it, its another bargain-priced release from Ratalaika Games that offers trophy hunters an easy Platinum.Its hard to overstate just how by-the-numbers this game is. Your spacecraft is generic. Your enemies are forgettable. Your weapons are unimpressive. The dozen levels all blend together in every respect from the terrain to the dialogue to the enemy flight patterns, and they offer little in the way of difficulty. If you were to close your eyes and picture a shmup, it would look something like thisThere are easy trophies to be had, because of course there are. Im not complaining about this, to be clear, since Ill always take another Platinum, but most of them will pop with little to no effort on your part.Just about the only place FullBlast deviates from being the blandest game ever is in its level design. As easy as this game generally is, you will occasionally die, and when you do, your weapon reverts back to the most basic level. This is a problem, because you dont get sent back to a checkpoint  which means that if, say, you happen to be fighting the level boss, youre doing so with the weakest weapon imaginable, which in turn means that youll quickly run your way through however many lives you have left.In general, however, thats more an annoyance than a game-breaking issue. And that pretty much sums up FullBlast: it doesnt do anything incredibly well, and the things it does poorly are so minor that its hard to get very worked up. If you want a short, easy shmup itll do, but otherwise, you can probably skip it.", "date": "November 1, 2018", "grade": "C-"}
