After all, I wasnt a huge fan of that game, and even if Ive forgotten why, its entirely possible that somewhere deep in my subconscious, I was holding on to that dislike. That, however, is highly unlikely  since, if anything, the fact I liked SAO: Lost Song looms much larger in my memory.Then I thought maybe I just wasnt following the story. After all, even at the best of times, I barely understood what was going on in previous SAO games; throw in a whole new anime in the form of Accel World, and I think itd be understandable if I was at a loss.But this isnt a satisfactory explanation either. Ive been able to overlook a total lack of comprehension before, so that doesnt bother me. Whats more, its not like the plot is so complex that you require a detailed understanding of both SAO and Accel World. Like every other SAO game, this is a story of the players being trapped in their online world; a quick bit of explanation reveals that the Accel World characters are in roughly the same predicament. All thats left beyond that is details  and, of course, the unstated question of why SAO players keep playing given the frequency at which their game is highjacked by some malevolent force.Its not even the massive character roster. Sure, its kind of a pain to keep every single one of the 40 (!!!) playable characters appropriately leveled up, and it makes sense if you cant keep every single one of their names and straight, but thats really more a subsidiary complaint than anything else.When I get right down to it, I think what bothers me the most about Accel World VS Sword Art Online is that the controls are mediocre at best. Combat is nowhere near as smooth as it was in previous SAO games; everything still feels hacky-slashy, but in a much more disjointed way than was ever the case before. Likewise, basic character movement feels off, particularly if you want to fly. And if you want to combine flight and combat? Then the game just becomes abysmal  which is kind of a big deal, since it occasionally demands that you fight airborne enemies.", "date": "October 2, 2017", "grade": "C-"}
