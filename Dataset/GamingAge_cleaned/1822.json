{"name": "Sparkle", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/12/sparkle-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Basically, Sparkle is Zuma.That may sound overly simplistic, but theres really no other way of describing Sparkle. Its not kind of like Zuma, or incredibly indebted to Zuma. Sparkle is, in pretty much every possible way, so similar to Zuma that its developers are probably lucky PopCap arent feeling particular litigious at the moment.In 10tons defense, I should point out that there are a couple of extremely minor differences. Most notably, where Zuma has a vaguely Mexican theme, Sparkle is significantly less specific, and goes for a more general mystical theme. Also, in Sparkle you shoot marbles at power-ups, rather than coins  but, it should be noted, those power-ups have the exact same abilities as the special shots in Zuma. Lastly, Sparkle substitutes touchscreen controls (or thumbsticks, if youre feeling masochistic) in place of mouse-clicking, sacrificing only a minimum of precision in the process.Beyond those few things, though, the games are basically identical. If youve somehow avoided playing Zuma at any point in the last ten years as a free web game, that means this: in both games, youre responsible for shooting marbles that are slowly (and occasionally not-so-slowly) working their way down a track towards a hole. When you match three or more marbles of the same colour, they vanish from the track. The level ends when either all the marbles are gone or theyve reached the hole. Its pretty simple, but also highly addictive.", "date": "December 30, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
