{"name": "The Raven  Legacy of a Master Thief", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/02/raven-legacy-master-thief-review-ps3-xbox-360/", "text": "Seeing as the vast majority of my experience playing adventure games has been with the likes of the Mystery Case Files series and Voodoo Chronicles  in other words, with hidden object games  my first time playing The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief was kind of a revelation. It was like, Actual character animations? Woah! Voice acting that doesnt suck? Amazing! And a score thats genuinely well-made? Sign me up!On top of its higher-than-usual (or, at least, higher-than-what-Im-used-to) production quality, The Raven also features a pretty decent story. It aims to be a mystery novel in video game form, and it succeeds at this, keeping you guessing with the clues and the twists and turns from beginning to end. In this regard, the game is helped immensely by the fact it essentially rips off Agatha Christie in every way possible, right down to the fact that one of the characters is a mystery novelist who shares a name with Christies pseudonym. I mean, if you want to be all technical about it, the detective here is Swiss instead of Belgian, but still  this is, for all intents and purposes, Hercule Poirot: The Video Game.Unfortunately, because its a video game, it calls for some form of player input at times, and thats where The Raven doesnt hold together quite as well as youd want it to. To put it bluntly, the controls kind of suck. Moving Poiroter, sorry, Zellner around is torturous. Getting him from point A to point B in anything resembling a straight line is impossible without holding your thumbstick down as hard as possible, and evidently he was programmed with some form of OCD that requires him to turn in a circle before he can pick up or talk to whatever youve selected onscreen.Which, come to think of it, is another area where the controls are deficient. Putting Zellner in the exact spot where he can see certain objects is a massive pain. When theyre clustered together, its not that bad  you can cycle through them relatively painlessly with your right thumbstick  but when theyre not, it can take a couple of passthroughs before you get it right. You can, of course, cheat a little by having the system highlight all points of interest in any given area, but then youre deducted a certain number of points according to the games arcane scoring system. Admittedly, that cheat doesnt really impact the game in any specific way, but it does hurt you in a hard-to-discern way if trophies are your thing.", "date": "February 5, 2014", "grade": "B"}
