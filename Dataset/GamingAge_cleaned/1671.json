So much so that Wikipedia makes the comparison, and they dont even include a [citation needed]. Want to know something, though? I never actually played Micro Machines, so I have no idea how valid that comparison is. What I do know, however, is that Table Top Racing is one of the better kart racing games Ive played, on the Vita or otherwise. Its cute, its easy to pick up, and its got more than enough depth to make it worth your time and money.Its obvious even to me, of course, that its not the most original game. I may not have played Micro Machines the game, but I did play with actual Micro Machines, and its pretty easy to see a direct line from those to the tiny vehicles in Table Top Racing. Likewise, you have all the standard pick-ups  the missile, the mine, the speed boost  that have been in kart racing games sincewell, not quite time immemorial, but definitely since the first Mario Kart.Of course, since the formula has been established for so long, its really more a question of how well the game puts it all together than it is of how fresh and new it all seems. And on that front, Table Top Racing does pretty well. The cars arent just adorably small, they also control pretty well. Likewise, the environments do a fantastic job of taking commonplace items and making courses out of them. You might not expect it from the description, but racing over dice and between hot dogs and around pencils is surprisingly thrilling when its done as well as it is here.Whats more, the pick-ups and power-ups and upgrades are all implemented perfectly. None of them seem that impressive at first, but as you get into later innings and you start seeing how the different vehicles improve and all the different ways you can get an edge on your opponents, you really start to appreciate how much depth this game actually has.", "date": "August 12, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
