{"name": "Valley", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/valley-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "If youre the kind of person who measures a games value primarily from the number of hours you sink into it, Valley probably isnt for you. After all, you can beat it and explore pretty much its entire world in well under five hours  probably under four if you really push yourself. On a dollars-to-hours ratio, thats not great.By any other measure, though, Valley is phenomenal. It exists in a sweet spot between Bioshock-style first person shooter and walking simulator  two genres that you wouldnt think have a ton in common, but that mesh together perfectly here.It bridges the gap thanks to the nifty inclusion of something called a L.E.A.F. suit. Id be hard-pressed to tell you exactly what L.E.A.F. stands for; its quickly explained early on in the game, and I cant for the life of me remember what it said. I can, however, tell you that when its enabling you to jump across massive canyons, or dash sideways across a wall, or hurtle down abandoned tracks at a breakneck speed, youre probably not going to care about the acronym specifics. Moving your character in Valley is a blast, and seeing as this game is all about traversing expansive distances as you uncover its secrets, that means it starts from a pretty strong position.It helps, too, that the world youre exploring is gorgeous. Valley is set somewhere in the Canadian Rockies, and the game takes full advantage of that fact. The mountains reach high into the clear blue skies, the trees  when you play the game as its developers intended  are luscious and green, and the water shimmers and shines even in the darkest and dankest of caverns. Youre not that far from nature, either, when youre exploring the abandoned factories, elevators and other structures that dot Valleys world. Most places have been overrun by roots and branches, and even the underground tunnels are falling apart, as mine shafts and railway tracks give way to rocks and moss.The scenery, of course, is only one part of what gives Valley such a fantastic atmosphere. Just as important are the traces of the abandoned world. After all, there are no other humans around, so the game tells its story via discovered notes and audio tapes, along with posters and other hints of what was going on. Its not a new way of storytelling, obviously, but its handled with such care here that its hard to not get drawn in.Valley is also helped immeasurably by the way it handles combat. As you probably gathered from the mention of walking simulators up top, this isnt a game where you go around blasting enemies to bits. There are, however, some antagonists that pop up from time to time, and when they do, youre well-equipped to handle them with a few blasts of energy from your L.E.A.F. suit. Its not the focal point of the game by any means, but its executed well enough that it never feels out of place.", "date": "September 9, 2016", "grade": "A"}
