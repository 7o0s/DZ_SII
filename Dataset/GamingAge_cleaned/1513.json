I certainly like the idea behind it: a hack & slash Metroidvania with an epic (if confusing) story and decent-sized levels to explore. There arent a lot of those, especially on the Vita, so to get one  even if its a port of a 3DS game from last year  is always welcome.The thing is, I cant say I like the execution of Aeternoblade. In fact, to be blunt, the best that could be said about it is that its profoundly mediocre. Its not exactly terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but I dont think theres anything about the game that you could point to say and say, Yes, thats done really well.Take the graphics. Theres no denying that Aeternoblade looks better on the Vita than it did on the 3DSbut that hardly seems like a bragging point. Im sure that the characters probably looked pretty cool when they were being dreamed up, but that didnt translate into their in-game representations. Basically, imagine stereotypical Final Fantasy characters, only muddy and indistinct, and you have an idea of how everything, from the heroes to the monsters, looks here. Needless to say, the environments dont fare much better.The same goes for the combat. Again, in theory, its awesome. You have a badass-looking heroine, Freyja, clad in relatively functional armour (even if the butt openings seem kind of silly), fuelled by a sense of righteous vengeance against the demon that laid waste to her village and armed with the titular giant sword. In practice, though, it all feels off. Freyja swings her sword in the general direction of her enemies, but it never feels like she connects with them, even when she has. Not only that, combos  which are absolutely essential, since this game doesnt have any one-hit kill enemies  are incredibly awkward. Any time you swing your sword more than once, it leads to a series of swings that can only go in one direction, which means that if your enemy has moved out of the way, youre stuck flailing away at empty space. (Though that doesnt always lead to bad results; I regularly had enemies walk into my blade right at the end of a combo, just as the swings were strongest, sending them across the screen. They may not have been satisfying hits, but at least they were powerful.)The mediocrity even extends to the games performance. Aeternoblade works, and it never crashesbut thats offset by the unending loading times between each section of each level. Considering that sections are incredibly small and levels are pretty big, thats a lot of time just sitting and waiting for the game to continue.", "date": "February 17, 2015", "grade": "C+"}
