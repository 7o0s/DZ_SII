{"name": "Shadow Warrior", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/10/shadow-warrior-review-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "If you missed out on Shadow Warrior when it released on PC last year, then you missed one of the better attempts at revitalizing and capturing the spirit of one of the more unique 90s first-person shooters. I dont know that Id call Shadow Warrior the best FPS out there, but its certainly one of the more humorous, fun entries in the genre in recent years. Youll need a high tolerance for Wang jokes and other off-color humor, but provided you can overcome that hurdle, Shadow Warrior is certainly worth a look on Xbox One and PS4.The first thing that stands out to me is that this is a great looking game. Theres little, if anything, lost in transition from PC to console here. The game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second, textures glisten with detail, and the varied environments remain colorful and outstanding. The gore is still very over the top, evident five minutes in as you start slicing away at demons and humans with your blade. Theres also some fun callbacks to the classic PC version of Shadow Warrior with secret rooms designed to mimic the pixelated, blocky level layouts of the original 97 release by 3D Realms. Visual fidelity comes as no surprise considering this is a Flying Wild Hog developed title, who did equally fantastic work on their previous release, Hard Reset.Shadow Warrior is also just gleefully fun to play. Enemies arent particularly smart, the A.I. isnt going to win any awards, but its also remarkably satisfying to dash around while slicing into demons, grabbing their hearts as an instant-kill weapon, and knocking away limbs with well placed bullets. The controls are a little awkward transitioning from PC to console, aiming is done by lightly pressing the right trigger, or clicking in the right analog. Its not ideal, especially if youre used to standard shooter controls on consoles, but Shadow Warrior compensates by giving you a generous lock-on range when you bring up the sights, making headshots pretty easy to pull off.While there are a number of areas in Shadow Warrior that are pretty linear, theres enough freedom in most stages to allow for some exploration, Hidden areas, bonus items, and extra cash/karma are scattered around liberally enough to make it worth looking for. Your character upgrades, granted by spending the aforementioned cash and karma, are useful without becoming too powerful. Weapon variety is fun and varied, and the ability to mix melee attacks with ranged is a nice change of pace from other FPS titles.", "date": "October 30, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
