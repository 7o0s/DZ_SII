After all, it was developed by a company with Mobile right in their name, and its gameplay and mechanics seems like they were tailor-made for short, pick up and play sessions and the handhelds touchscreen.Heres the surprising thing, though: the Vita version of the game is kind of terrible. It relies way too much on touch controls, particularly considering its a dual thumbstick shooter that doesnt even use half the buttons at its disposal. (It wont be remembered in the annals of bad design or anything, but expecting players to be able to move their squads around wth both thumbsticks while at the same time using extra weapons via touch controls is kind of ridiculous.) Consequently, because the controls are so bad, the level of difficulty borders on impossible, with even the easiest levels being filled with unbeatable enemies.Which leads to the other surprising thing: Tiny Troopers Joint Ops is way, way better on PS3. To some extent, I guess this shouldnt be such a shock  after all, if gaming is better with buttons in general, then it stands to reason that the version of the game that uses buttons instead of touch controls will be better than the one that tries to incorporate a touchscreen. Still, its pretty remarkable how much better the game is on a console. With the controls more balanced, it naturally follows that the difficulty level is suddenly a lot more fair, which in turn means its possible to actually enjoy the game.", "date": "November 6, 2014", "grade": "B"}
