{"name": "Jurassic World Evolution: Complete Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/06/jurassic-world-evolution-complete-edition-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "A couple of years ago, my colleague Tyler reviewed Jurassic World Evolution back when it first came out for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. He wasnt a fan, though he had high praise for the games graphics. Now that the game has arrived on the Switch alongside all its DLC, is it any better?Yes and no. The bad news about this Switch port is that its very, very ugly. Much like Tropico 6 a few months ago, a lot of sacrifices were made in order to get Jurassic World Evolution to run on Nintendos system, and thats apparent on every screen, whether youre roaming around the grounds of the titular theme park, squinting to make out what type of land youre looking at, or going through one of the many management screens, also squinting at reading some less-than-crisp font.Theres also voice acting here  including Dr. Ian Malcolm himself, Jeff Goldblum  which is kind of a mixed bag. One the one hand, its pretty neat to hear Goldblum providing his characters brand of cynical quips. On the other hand, none of the other voice actors are quite on his level, and the way the sound clips are integrated into the action bring to mind some of the shoddier quality voice acting from generations past (which is to say, they sound bad).If you can get past the presentation, however, Jurassic World Evolution is pretty enjoyable  even if, as Tyler noted a few years ago, its a little shallow. As someone who struggles with feeling overwhelmed by games when given free reign to do whatever I want, I appreciated the way that this game gives you a story, even if that story is make this part as profitable as possible.I also liked how relatively simple it was to figure out what youre doing here. Even without a tutorial (at least, as far as I could tell), the game is surprisingly intuitive. Compared to plenty of other city-building/management games that Ive played, it was impressive how little hand-holding there is here, even as the game asks you to carry out a pretty wide range of tasks.Admittedly, its probably also worth noting that some parts of Jurassic World Evolution are kind of stupid. For starters, theres the fact that you have three categories of tasks here  for the Science, Entertainment and Security  and, for some inexplicable reason, the different sections are at odds with each other. I know there was a bit of that way back in the first Jurassic Park movie, but its still bizarre that the sections would actively try to sabotage each other.Moreover, the game is perhaps a little overly focused on maximizing profits at the expense of all other aspects of park management. I know that makes for an easy way to gauge success, but having no blowback from dinosaurs escaping and eating tourists  or even from going all in on restaurants and gift shops at the expense of restrooms  seems like a weird choice.Nonetheless, provided you can overlook plenty of gaps in logic (not to mention hideous graphics and lousy voice acting), theres something to be said for Jurassic World Evolution. It may not be the greatest amusement park sim or city builder the Switch has to offer, but its solid enough in its own right that its at least pretty fun time.", "date": "June 2, 2021", "grade": "B+"}
