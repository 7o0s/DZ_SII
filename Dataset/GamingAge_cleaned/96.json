Occasionally youll get a decent game out of the bargain, but for the most part, the allure is getting the Platinum rather than getting a memorable experience.You can imagine my surprise, then, to discover that, with Sagebrush, you get not just a memorable experience, but something thats a legitimate Game of the Year contender, as far as Im concerned.Before I go any further, Ill very quickly add that Sagebrush isnt for everybody. Its not just a walking simulator in the vein of Everybodys Gone to the Rapture or Gone Home, its designed to look like a PS1-era game. As such, youre wandering around a retro-looking 3D world, and everything looks blurry and indistinct by design. Unless youre really invested in the story, its probably going to piss you off.Thankfully, the story here is incredible. The game starts with you standing outside the locked gate of a ranch, and you have to figure out a way to break in. Once inside, you explore the compound of a suicide cult, and you piece together both how they lived, and what happened in their final days.It makes for one of the most chilling games Ive ever experienced. As you uncover journals and tape recordings, you create a portrait of a monster. You see how Father James keeps his community of believers under his thumb, and you see the terrifying lengths he goes to in demanding obedience. Some of it is truly stomach-churning, and even if Sagebrush doesnt  and, considering the PS1 graphics, probably cant  ever show anything too bad, Ill just say that there are a few parts that make the game earn its M rating.It also bears mentioning that even though Sagebrushs Platinum trophy is as easy youd expect, unlike some of their more recent games in which that final trophy popped well before the game was anywhere close to being finished, here the Platinum is only earned once the game is truly finished. Obviously, that has nothing to do with Sagebrushs quality, but given how the Platinum has been mishandled in other Ratalaika games and disincentivized you playing the game to its completion, its nice to see them fix that mistake here.Really, though, thats just a very tiny part of why Sagebrush is such a phenomenal game. It may not look like much, but it bets big on its ability to draw you in to a horrifying story  and, by the end of its short running time, its succeeded at doing that beyond any shadow of a doubt.", "date": "August 20, 2019", "grade": "A+"}
