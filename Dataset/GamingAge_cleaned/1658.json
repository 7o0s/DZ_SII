Yes, its the game where you run around Japans Akihabara district and strip people down to their underwear. And yes, many of those people happen to be women who, in the spirit of seemingly every Japanese game, look barely pubescent (to put it mildly). If you feel like quibbling, you could get into the plot (more on that in a bit), but when you get down to the basicsyeah, its the stripping game.If you can get over that, however  and I admit, its a pretty odd premise to have to get over  you may find yourself pleasantly surprised by the fact that its actually a really fun game. Weird as heck, of course, but fun nonetheless.It helps tremendously that the plot seldom comes off as creepy or as prurient as it sounds. The very first people you have to strip are evil henchmen (emphasis on men), the first secret vampire monsters you have to fight are male, and youre aided in your quest by women, a few of whom arent dressed like Lolita dolls (and the one who is dressed like one is the one who saves you in the first place). I dont want to minimize the fact youre literally running up to random women and ripping their clothes off, since that obviously as some pretty disturbing connotations, but at the very least, this game is an equal opportunity offender in that respect. Men and women alike get stripped down to their skivvies, which seems like a pretty massive step forward, at least by the kinda screwed up sexual political standards of Japanese games.It helps too that Akibas Trips writing is surprisingly hilarious. This isnt spoiling much, but you can bring about a Game Over screen within five minutes of starting the game just by choosing the funniest option every time (and I do mean legitimately funny, not just funny-by-game-standards). This game skewers targets that are ripe for skewering, and its not afraid to get a little absurd at times. Case in point: theres a funny line about photosynthesis in here. When was the last time you even considered photosynthesis in a game, let alone had a chance to laugh about it?Luckily, all this great writing is backed up by some pretty solid gameplay. The characters move really well, whether theyre simply running around Akihabara or fighting those aforementioned vampires, and the combat, for the most part, is smooth and flowing. There are some issues with the camera during fights, but on the whole, Akibas Trip plays really well.There are some other minor issues, too. I said combat is smooth for the most part because Im still not sure why the game allows you to jump. Its never a huge issue, but it is a little annoying. Also annoying: the load times between areas. Its less of an issue when you jump from place to place via map (the other option is to run block by block), but at times it does seem to take a little long.", "date": "August 27, 2014", "grade": "A"}
