{"name": "More Dark", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/02/more-dark-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "When a game calls itself retro  or, at the very least, when a game makes a very obvious attempt to look like it came out thirty years ago, as is the case with More Dark  thats usually code for one thing: its super-hard. Yes, it also means pixel graphics and chiptune music and whatnot, but really, it all comes down to trying to punish players.And sometimes, thats totally fine. Its not necessarily my thing, but I totally get that some players like being pushed, and there are plenty of games that manage to be tough-but-fair. They may try and kill you at every turn, but theyre at least balanced enough that you can see why you died every time it happens.But other times  that is, in a game like More Dark  you dont die frequently because its insanely challenging, you die frequently because the game is built around cheap deaths.If youre being generous, I guess, you could euphemistically call a lot of those deaths trial and error. This is a puzzle-platformer, after all, and most of the levels have only one solution, and if you do anything out of order, your only choice is to explode your little pixelated demon and try again. I found it a little frustrating that the game is so restrictive in its solutions, since it takes away the joy of playing around with a level to see what you can do with it, but Im not going to condemn More Dark outright for that.Whats a lot harder to take, though, are all the times you die because of iffy design. Your jumps are a little inconsistent in how far and how high you go, which means that sometimes you can cross a gap thats more than an inch wide, but other times youll explode on an environmental hazard. Further, the enemy hit detection is a little hard to figure out, and you can often die if you dont land on their heads just right. Again, its inconsistent, and it drags the game down. Obviously, eventually you come to live with both of these flaws, but theres a huge gulf between grudgingly accepting a games flaws and being able to ignore them because everything else is so great.More Dark most definitely falls into the former camp: its not the worst game in the world, but its flawed enough its hard to enjoy it. Given all the other retro-flavoured puzzle-platformers out there that dont feature lousy design choices, youre probably better off skipping More Dark and playing something else instead.", "date": "February 1, 2021", "grade": "C+"}
