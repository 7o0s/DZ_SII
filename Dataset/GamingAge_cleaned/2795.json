{"name": "A Hero and A Garden", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/12/a-hero-and-a-garden-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "A Hero and A Garden is interesting in that it mixes together two genres that some people have a hard time accepting as games. Part of the game is a visual novel, where you just press a button to advance the story along. The other part is a clicker game, where youpress a button to advance the story along, only in a different way.Theres not a lot for you to do here other than click a few buttons, is what Im trying to say.But even though its not the most interactive of games, A Hero and a Garden is still charming in its own right. It follows the story of a prince who attempted to save a princess, but who destroyed a village and got captured by a witch in the process. Once hes imprisoned, he has to work off his debt by tending a garden, selling fruit to the monsters in town, and paying off repairs  which is where you come in.As youd expect from a clicker game  or a visual novel, for that matter  A Hero and a Garden doesnt ask much of you as all this is happening. You spend most of your time watching your bushes fill up with berries, at which point you harvest them with a quick click of a button. Occasionally the game takes a break to show you a short cutscene, but for the most part, its watching and clicking.Obviously, its not for everyone. If you want any kind of action whatsoever, you wont find it here. All youd find is a cute little game about a prince becoming a better person, in a story via animation that looks hand drawn and a font that looks almost like Comic Sans. That may not sound like much, but its pleasant, and thats more than enough for me.", "date": "December 8, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
