Before I say anything else about Mugen Souls Z, I feel like thats an important distinction to be made, since it very much seems like the sort of game that requires quite a bit of advance knowledge of the characters and the plots going into it. I base this feeling on the fact that, quite frankly, I had absolutely no idea what was going on most of the time. There are gods and goddesses and demon lords and multiple universes, and no matter how much of the ample dialogue I read, I never felt any closer to knowing what I was doing. Admittedly, there were plenty of points in the game where I didnt want to know what was happening. Like the times where the extremely young-looking girls had baths for no obvious reason; that was kind of icky, no matter where the little clouds of steam were strategically placed. Also, when a baby was chewing on an older gentleman/demon lord, and he complained that her bites were starting to get weaker; coupled with the prior knowledge that the demon lord was kinky, that also gave off weird vibes. In fact, Ill just expand that out and say that if a cutscene was taking place, its highly likely that someone was going to say or do something kind of questionable.That said, no matter how disturbing some of the relationships in the game might be, theyre nothing compared to the sheer offensiveness of how the game looks. I cannot emphasize this fact enough: Mugen Souls Z is the very definition of eyesore. And its not just ugly, either; its bright, too. Really, really bright. So bright and gaudy that even I felt like my eyeballs were about to bleed and my brain was about to explode, and the very first thing I usually do when I play a game is crank the brightness as high as it will go. If you like eye-searing shades of neon, youve come to the right place (also, welcome to 2014  I hope your journey from the early 90s was a pleasant one), but otherwise, you might want to invest in shades if you want to play. Should you want to play, though? Despite my feelings about the characters and the graphics, I have to say that my answer isnt as emphatic a No! as you might be expecting. For one thing, the games willingness to go way over the top in every respect works to its advantage when it comes to the action. Somehow, even the most mundane turn-based combat becomes super-exciting when you can knock thousands and millions and billions of points off your opponents life bar. Similarly, I may not be crazy about the flashing neon colors in normal circumstances, but when youre annihilating your opponent with some insane combo, the color kind of adds to it all.And, I mean, considering how rote RPGs can seem some of the time, you have to admire one that just throws everything it can think of out there, without any regard forwell, anything, really.", "date": "May 22, 2014", "grade": "B-"}
