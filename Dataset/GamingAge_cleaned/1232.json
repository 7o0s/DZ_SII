{"name": "Bombing Busters", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/12/bombing-busters-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "I feel like theres a limit to just how well I can grade Bombing Busters. I mean, even if it were a legitimate contender for Game of the Year  which its not, but stay with me for a second here  the fact its a fairly straightforward Bomberman clone seems like it puts a pretty firm ceiling on how well it could be received. I have nothing against blatant thievery (after all, the Arkham-aping Captain America: Super Soldier from a few years ago is still one of my favorite games ever), but at the same time, I also dont think that it should be rewarded unreservedly.Credit where credit is due, though: Bombing Busters may be a full-on clone, but its also a well-made one. The controls are intuitive, it looks as nice as it needs to, and I really enjoyed the soundtrack (though even this isnt without a caveat; more on that in a second). The difficulty curve may be a little steep, especially considering the levels are randomized, but considering how simple the gameplay is, its hard to get too annoyed if some boards and enemies are a little tougher than others.Still, its hard to say how much praise Bombing Busters should get for any of this. It makes virtually no effort to build on the Bomberman formula, which means that whatever this game does right, it does so because Bomberman  in one version or another  did it right first. And in the one area where the game shines independently of Bomberman, its still built on reflected glory: the game is scored by slightly tweaked versions of songs like Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, Flight of the Bumble Bee and In The Hall of the Mountain King. Theyre great tracks, to be sure, and they fit the game very well, but it seems like Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Grieg deserve credit for that more than Sanuk.", "date": "December 22, 2015", "grade": "B-"}
