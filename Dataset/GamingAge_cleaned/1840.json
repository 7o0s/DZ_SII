As you can probably tell from the trailer, it is a weird, weird game. I mean, its a little less odd than that trailer would imply, but on the strangeness spectrum  where, say, Call of Duty is at one end, and something like the Katamari series is at the other  its most definitely on the latter side.First, though, a rough overview of what Doki-Doki Universe actually is, since it may not be entirely clear from the info HumaNature Studios has released to date, and its not something that can be conveyed in just a few words. Basically, youre playing as a robot (nicknamed QT3) abandoned by its owner-family, and aliens have decreed that unless you can prove your humanity, you and all the other robots in your particular line will be destroyed. To do this, you have to travel from planet to planet, solving various problems and taking psychological tests.Or something like that. Youre also in love with a balloon named Balloon, you solve problems by collecting sticker-like items that come to life, and you ride around the galaxy on adog (I think?). Oh, and you use the back touchpad to greet your friends in the various ways bow, hug, handshake, etc.  that they prefer.In other words, its not really a game that can be easily classified (or, for that matter, described). There are hints of Little Big Planet with the sticker-triggers, and the problem-solving aspect clearly has its roots in the adventure genre, but to simply call it an adventure game misses the point. Adding in the psychological testing to call it an adventure-psych test hybrid kind of does the trick, but Im pretty sure that such a genre doesnt exist.So Doki-Doki Universe is basically exists as a genre unto itself. You know what, though? Thats not a bad thing  not when its done as perfectly as it is here. The game tells its story with so much cuteness and warmth and heart that its impossible to avoid getting drawn into its rhythms. I wouldnt go so far as to say its the most adorable game on the Vita  not with Tearaway so fresh in my memory  but I would say that its certainly right up there.", "date": "December 10, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
