{"name": "WWE 2K18", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/10/wwe-2k18-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "The World Wrestling Entertainment (Federation) has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, which Im sure some of you know based on some of my prior reviews and previews. I still remember watching Wrestlemania 9 live on Pay Per View with my dad, nearly 25 years ago, from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. While Im sure I watched events and shows prior to that, Wrestlemania 9 is a memory I hold close to me and has become something special. From that point in 1993, Ive been a fan of the WWF/E, and a loyal one at that. When WCW started to rise up (and steal all the WWF/E talent), I stuck with the WWF/E. All along the way playing every and any wrestling video game that saw the light of day, some were great (WWF No Mercy, WWF War Zone, WCW/NWO Revenge) and some were horrendous (WWE Crush Hour, Simpsons Wrestling, WCW Backstage Assault). Now here we are with 2Ks annual WWE release, and as I said in my review for last years game I expected a lot to come from 2K18 based on 2K17 being very average.Sadly, all of my love for WWE cant save how I feel about WWE 2K18. I feel it was important to mention my history with the company and wrestling games in general, because I want you to see just how much I wished that this game would be better than it is and how we deserve better. This may read like a beat up session and Im sorry for that, but I love wrestling and year after year I give 2K the benefit of the doubt since theyve taken over from THQ and I just cant do it anymore. WWE 2K18 broke my jabroni back and its time to humble them.Last year with WWE 2K17, I gave 2K a lot of leeway as I expected them to be already hard at work on 2K18; I was wrong to do that. For the second year in a row, there isnt a Showcase mode. Showcase mode had been a staple for the series in the past four to five years and was one of my favorite modes to jump into each year. Playing through the career of Steve Austin, Wrestlemanias history, rivalries, the attitude era and more. Showcase was a great mode that really displayed the love the development team had for the WWE. It featured voice overs, video packages, special commentary, special match objectives and Im sure Im forgetting other things. As a die hard WWE fan, you got to relive classic memories and moments and be a part of them.So with 2K17, I figured the team maybe didnt have enough time to put in the effort on a whole Showcase mode, due to release date or maybe getting talent for voice overs, whatever it might be. I was wrong, it seems. Here we are with the release of WWE 2K18 and yet again no Showcase mode, so it looks like I was a damn fool. Not only isnt there a Showcase mode but there isnt any mode that could be considered as a replacement for it. Sure we still have Universe mode (which is extremely similar to previous years) and we have a My Career/Road to Glory mode, but neither of these two modes come close to what previous games had within their Showcase mode. There isnt any single player mode that taps that WWE history or passion and thats just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to WWE 2K18.Lets jump into some match options that are NEW to this years release. We finally have 8-man matches! So now you can have Royal Rumble matches with up to 8 wrestlers in the ring at once. I feel like the consoles have had the capability to do this for years (since it was available on the Dreamcast and PS2 for older WWE titles), but Im still really excited that we finally have the option for 8-man matches. Before I continue with 8-man matches, I do want to say that the Royal Rumble mode, which is a favorite to play solo and with friends, is great this year. They improved the mini games within the match, eliminations can come a bit easier for you and for the AI and the match can get more hectic than it could previously with the 6 person limit.Now for the 8-man match Ive been dreaming about playing in a game since I was a kid; Survivor Series! (or 8-man tag as its listed). This match has a huge bug that makes the mode practically unplayable. Ive tested this multiple times and while Im sure it can be fixed with a patch, it hadnt been fixed days after release and thats unacceptable for a $60+ game, especially when its something that should have been one of the first things tested. What could this bug possibly be you ask? Well the referee in this match decides about nine out of ten times that I attempt to pin my opponent, to take a coffee break and not count the pinfall. Yep, a referee in a wrestling game, the person who controls the outcome of the match, just stands there as the wrestler awkwardly make a pin attempt and waits and waits and waits. Needless to say if you want to play this match to completion youre in for a lot of frustration and major slowdown.I forgot to mention the slowdown thats involved when theres 8 wrestlers on the screen. At points it seems like the match is going in slow motion or in a laggy online matchup. I like that 2K took the initiative to add the 8-man matches (at least they added SOMETHING) but the engine clearly cant handle all the wrestlers on the screen at the same time. This mode needed more time in the proverbial NXT oven. Hopefully future patches can fix this, but again that isnt an excuse to release a full priced game thats broken at launch and say ahh well fix that later. Let me mention something positive about 2K18 before this gets away from me and I turn into the Angry Videogame Nerd. The roster for WWE 2K18 is great, every year it gets larger and larger. I do wish they kept everyone from previous years, but regardless, this roster is full with almost everyone you would expect (they wont let me walk with Elias though, until the DLC comes out down the road).One last bit I want to talk about is the in game audio, specifically the commentary. They decided to add Byron Saxton and Corey Graves, which made me think they would record all new sessions with Michael Cole, Graves and Saxton. The finished result comes off like all three recorded their dialogues separately, not only that, but Michael Coles lines appear at times to be lifted from previous 2K games. Based off other 2K sports franchises currently and in the past, I expect so much more when it comes to commentary. 2K used to be the leader in how to do sports game commentary and this is just another thing that feels worse year over year. While Im at it, when am I going to be able to use custom music for my created wrestlers? Last gen consoles let you do it, but we have yet to see this feature available on current gen systems.", "date": "October 22, 2017", "grade": "D"}
