{"name": "Knock-Knock", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/07/knock-knock-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "I dont ask for or expect a lot out of games when it comes to their narratives. Seeing as I play so many of them, I should probably be a little more discerning and demanding, but Im willing to overlook any number of flaws when it comes to character development, or pacing, or tone, or nearly any other key narrative component. In fact, theres only one thing I consider essential: that the games world have a consistent internal logic. It can be completely ridiculous or wacky or unrealistic, but there needs to be some kind of understandable causality at work. And unfortunately, that cant be said about Knock-Knock.This is unfortunate, because in every other area, its fantastic. The core of the game is that youre playing hide and seek with some malevolent being, and you need to make it to sunrise in order to survive. As premises go, thats pretty top-notch, and Knock-Knock is great at ratcheting up its inherent tension with all kinds of squeaks and knocks and disembodied voices. This game knows how to leave you feeling pretty unsettled, which is obviously a critical component of any horror game.Similarly, the games visual aesthetic is pretty unnerving. Environments are lit by candles and moonlight, which means that, most of the time, youre only seeing a shadowy fraction of whats around you, as darkness reaches in towards your disheveled main character. On top of that, Knock-Knock is set in a world where everything  from the finger-like branches of the trees around your house, to the decrepit bed that sits in your dingy bedroom, to the weird stains on the walls, to the bricked-up windows and doors  has a sinister vibe. If you can look at this game and not come away with the heebie-jeebies, youre a braver person than I.Even the gameplay works pretty well, to a point. Your interactions with the game mainly consist of slowly screwing in new lightbulbs and painstakingly unlocking doors, and then hoping there arent monsters or spirits lurking nearby. To a point, its pretty effective.But once you pass that point, Knock-Knock falls apart. It never really tells you what to do, for starters. The main character speaks to himself/you in cryptic muttering, half-explaining what youre supposed to do, but never enough that youll fully get it. Likewise, one of the disembodied voices gives you hints, but its never clear what youre supposed to do with those, since the game cant decide if those voices are supposed to be looking after you or out to get you. With no obvious tells either way, youre at the mercy of evil spirits just randomly showing up and making you start the level over again.", "date": "July 19, 2016", "grade": "B-"}
