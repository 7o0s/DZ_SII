{"name": "Asdivine Hearts II", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/05/asdivine-hearts-ii-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Its been more than two years since I played the original Asdivine Hearts. Over that time, Ive played more interchangeable KEMCO JRPGS than I can count (or, apparently only seven, but it feels like a lot more).Going into Asdivine Hearts II, this is important for two, closely related reasons. First, given that pretty much all of those KEMCO games look and play exactly the same, Im having a really hard time remembering anything specific about the first Asdivine Hearts. Second, Asdivine Hearts II is full of references to its predecessor, and seems to rely on players having fond memories of its characters from the first go-around  which, in all honesty, I dont have. In fact, as you can probably gather, I dont have any kind of memories at all, positive or negative.Consequently, the most feeling I can muster here is a little bit of distaste, coupled with a whole lot of indifference. Whereas more recent KEMCO games have distinguished themselves by having surprisingly decent writing and characters, here everything seems much more clichd. You have one somewhat obnoxious male main character, Zack, and a whole bunch of female characters who all seem to exist solely to adore Zack. Ive certainly seen worse character development and interaction, but again, those qualities arent nearly as strong here as KEMCO shown themselves to be since the first Asdivine Hearts.In terms of gameplay and visuals, theres not anything here you havent seen countless times before. Like all the other KEMCO JRPGs, Asdivine Hearts II borrows heavily from 25-30 years ago, and doesnt do anything beyond that. It doesnt do that badly, to be sure, but unless youre a diehard fan of the series, I think youd be hard-pressed to look at this game and see anything distinctive.Which, I suppose, is kind of the point of all these games: to be a constant stream of JRPGs for anyone who cant get enough of the genre. Thats bad news if youve been anxiously awaiting an Asdivine Hearts sequel for yearsbut since I have a hard time imagining many (or any) people like that exist, I think Asdivine Hearts II does more or less what its intended to do.", "date": "May 20, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
