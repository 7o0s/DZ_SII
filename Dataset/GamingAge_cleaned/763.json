It has some neat explosions.Ive been trying for hours now to come up with a way of explaining what I like and dont like about it, and thats all I have in the like column. It is, by any measure, thoroughly okay.As for what I dont like about Agents of Mayhemwell, thats a little more complicated, and requires a brief foray into my feelings on the Saints Row franchise.See, I love Saints Row. I was kind of indifferent to Saints Row 2, but then, when the series went off the rails in the most insane ways imaginable starting with Saints Row: The Third, I was fully invested in it. And, crazy as this is going to sound, I bought in because even though it was ludicrously over-the-top, it felt grounded. Admittedly, it wasnt grounded in reality; seeing as the last game featured some of the characters being sent to literal Hell, and the game before that had them trapped inside an alien-created simulation of their hometown of Steelport, I dont think even I could argue that. But it always felt like the series had its own internal logic and laws; insane things happened constantly, but because they happened so often, it became easy to accept (assuming, of course, you were into it  I fully recognize that not everyone was happy when the franchise stopped trying to be a GTA clone).Moreover, Saints Row felt grounded because of its characters and its setting. Again, given that the series switched gears from Stilwater to Steelport starting in the third game, and that Steelport was an alien simulation by the fourth game, I know this may sound like a stretch, but I always found that I was able to suspend my disbelief and accept it as a lived-in world. In large part, this was because of the characters. They, like their world, were over-the-top in all kinds of absurd ways, but they still seemed to interact in relatively natural ways, and in the process humanized each other.And, at the centre of it all, was you. You, the player, were given a central role in their bizarre drama as The Protagonist, thanks to a character creation system that allowed you to be pretty much whoever you wanted to be. You interacted with Johnny Gat and Kinzie and Pierce and Shaundi, and in the process became a part of their story.Agents of Mayhem has none of these things. Its loosely set in the Saints Row universe, but its lacking all those things that made Saints Row games special. The setting is thoroughly forgettable; rather than creating a city and making it feel like its own place, Agents of Mayhem is set in a futuristic version of Seoul, one thats all space-age cars and neon and rounded edges. There are other people there, and the streets are filled with cars, but they feel like indistinct blurs that just happen to be in your way, who are there just because a city needs to have buildings, cars, and people. Its a city lacking in personality, which makes it awfully hard to get invested in the games stakes.On top of that, the main characters are forgettably cookie-cutter caricatures. You have an angry black man with a shotgun (Hardtack); you have a sassy Latina (Fortune); you have a mysterious Indian (Rama); and you have a cocky white guy (Hollywood). There are others, and you even get to control more people as your squad grows, but they almost all feel like collections of stereotypes voicing action game clichs and catchphrases, rather than actual characters. Where Saints Row featured people interacting with humour and heart, Agents of Mayhem simply doesnt.In fact  and if youll pardon one more digression  thats another area where Agents of Mayhem is sorely lacking: in the humour department. There are mild jokes here and there, and the game never takes itself too seriously, but theres nothing here on par with, say, a dildo gun, or intentionally glitched enemies, or recreations of Red Faction: Guerrilla. It all feels pretty generically funny, rather than actual, laugh-out-loud funny.Though really, that descriptor, generic, could be equally applied to most other aspects of the game. The cut scenes all borrow heavily from GI Joe; while they may have caused vague feelings of nostalgia deep in my 80s child brain, I cant say they did a whole lot more than that, and they certainly never had me invested in the story.And then, of course, theres the gameplay  the thoroughly enh, its fine gameplay. As someone who hates playing online multiplayer, I appreciate Agents of Mayhem giving me a chance to play an Overwatch-style team-based shooter all by my lonesome. It does a perfectly adequate job of giving you a range of destructive options, and if you want things to explode, you wont be lacking for them here. But  and I cant believe Im saying this  sometimes explosions just arent enough. Sometimes you want to feel like youre doing more than just firing bombs everywhere, and for those times, even when youre playing as someone who doesnt have explosive weapons, Agents of Mayhem is sorely lacking.", "date": "August 15, 2017", "grade": "B-"}
