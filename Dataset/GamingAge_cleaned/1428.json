{"name": "Ultra Street Fighter IV", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/05/ultra-street-fighter-iv-review-for-ps4/", "text": "Ultra Street Fighter IV was first revealedat the PlayStation Experience back in February and has been anticipated by fans and PS4 owners ever since. For those who do not own the Ultra Edition on PS3 or any other version that can be upgraded, then you should definitely check out this latest remastered release. Everything from the previous version has been included with this digital only offering with a few added perks.First, you get every single costume pack that has been previously released, so you can finally see Ryu wear a wolf costume while he pummels Chun-Li wearing a dragon-like chicken outfit! The next big inclusion is Omega Mode, if you missed this mode before; its basically Street Fighter IV on acid with new moves and crazy new combos for each character. This mode is great fun because of the insane matches you can have with a friend or online. Air fireballs and wild hurricane kicks fill the screen as you try to discover new and interesting ways to beat your opponent. All other modes, such as the Story and Training modes are present from the previous releases and contain all of the charm theyve always had, so this is what you can call the Definitive USF4 package.The big (and hugely welcome) addition to this version of USF4 is the ability to use your PS3 Fightsticks and pads you already own. Capcom was smart enough to include Lab Zeros drivers so that the PS4 will recognize your licensed sticks for maximum control. Speaking of control, one major problem with the previous versions of SF4 was minor input lag with wireless controllers and even with some wired sticks. Capcom has completely eliminated all lag no matter what controller you prefer, so the in the world of Pad vs. Stick, the play field has been made a bit more even.The PS4 edition is just as bright and brilliant in the audio and visual departments as it always has been. With constant 60fps and 1080p resolution, and its fantastic soundtrack, it looks and sounds absolutely amazing. Previous versions may have had a stutter in the animations here and there (especially when the action got intense), but thanks to the power of the PS4, any hiccup you might have seen is no longer present.", "date": "May 26, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
