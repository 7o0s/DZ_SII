Not only do they give away too much, but they often set too high a bar. If a trailer is doing its job  generating interest  its far too easy to set up the viewer for a letdown when the movie doesnt hold up. The same is sometimes true for video games. The trailer for Trackmania Turbo promises incredibly fast racing over surreal courses. In this case, not only is the trailer worth watching, but its dead on.Trackmania is and has always been about fast cars flying through fantastical courses of loops and jumps that have no business existing in the real world. Scenery is great and it goes by in a blur. Trackmania Turbo offers more of this than ever. There is no car damage, theres just going as fast as possible while staying on the track, of which there are 200 in four different areas.Each of the four areas has its own car. Canyon is all about drifting, and that car slides like its on casters. The Stadium track offers a classic open wheel speed demon that grips like crazy, as it should. Lagoon and Dirt Valley are somewhere in between.Unfortunately, you wont be playing any track you want until you progress through each area in order. Each environment is divided into five levels of difficulty (white, green, red, blue, black) and each level has 20 tracks. Theres no skipping straight to black until you earn enough medals on lower difficulties. At first, the screen full of locked tracks is a bummer. But most races are very short and even if you dont think you need to practice it starts to make sense to progress through all 200 tracks in some kind of order. Its not as rigid a system as it appears, either. Earning medals opens up the options quickly once you get going. The tough part is earning gold medals.Youll find a plethora of ways to share mania of tracks with friends, too. You can face their best times through online multiplayer, local hotseat play is available (praise baby Jesus), as is split screen. Online multiplayer offers custom lobbies, and the number of options is obviously intended to make Trackmania a shared experience.", "date": "March 25, 2016", "grade": "B+"}
