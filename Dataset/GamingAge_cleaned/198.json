{"name": "Peasant Knight", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/05/peasant-knight-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "Ive always been kind of impressed by anyone who can do speed runs  largely on account of the fact Im completely unable to pull them off myself. When it comes to platformers, Im usually the kind of person who likes to take their time on every level, thinking about what I want to do next before I do it.As such, its fun to play a game like Peasant Knight and get a taste of what its like to be able to do speed runs. This isnt because Ive suddenly changed my approach to platformers, but rather because theres literally no other way to play this game. Its basically a twitch platformer where you have a very short amount of time to finish most levels, and if you dont jump and stop with near-perfect precision, youll die.While such an approach could easily have been derailed by poor level construction or lousy controls, Peasant Knight works because it gets those things right. The levels are all short and easy to memorize (assuming you dont get them on your first try, which, after level 15 or so, you probably wont), which means that youll be able to figure out the necessary timing pretty quickly. Likewise, the controls are easy to grasp (in part because the eponymous knights default mode is moving forward), and responsive enough that youll be able to jump and stop on a dime as need be.Plus, of course, since this is a Ratalaika-published game, theres a somewhat easy Platinum to be had  two of them if you play the game on both PS4 and Vita.And even if you dont give a whit about trophies, Peasant Knight is still worth checking out. Its a fun, inexpensive game that knows what it wants to be, and is more than capable of meeting its goals. If that doesnt count as a success, I dont know what does.", "date": "May 3, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
