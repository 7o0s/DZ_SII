Despite the magical, wide-eyed naf, the anthropomorphized penguin, and the talk of chosen ones and multiple dimensions, when you get right down to it, this is basically just an isometric puzzle-platformer  and a pretty decent one at that.Of course, I dont want to downplay the aesthetic entirely. Its certainly a part of the game, and the odd bits of dialogue here and there contribute to it. If youre the type who likes girls and penguins engaging in cutesy dialogue, then this game will deliver on that front.Its just that QV delivers a lot more if youre the type who enjoys games like Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, Lumo, or Mekorama. The puzzles here are enjoyably difficult, and they ramp up in difficulty quickly enough that you dont feel like youre just doing the same thing over and over again  they may start as a simple exercise in walking (slowly) from point A to Point B, but its not long until youre pushing boxes and creating shortcuts from one part of a level to another. On top of that, the game helpfully colour codes the different dimensions, so that even if the basic gameplay doesnt change all that much, the levels look and feel tangibly different from each other.Obviously, theres nothing groundbreaking going on here, and despite the talk of Chosen Ones saving the world, QV never feels all that weighty. But it doesnt really need to. Its a simple puzzle game that offers a few hours of fun, and sometimes thats all you need.", "date": "March 10, 2021", "grade": "B"}
