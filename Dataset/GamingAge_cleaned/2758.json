{"name": "Cloudbase Prime", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/01/cloudbase-prime-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Youve heard of games where the sum total is greater than any of the individual parts? Cloudbase Prime is basically the opposite of that. It has some neat pieces, but when you put them all together, it feels like its missing something.Take, for example, the platforming  an important part of the game, since were talking about a platformer/first-person shooter. While your character can run and jump a little bit, for the most part, youre getting around Cloudbase Primes world by having the ground launch you into space, and then you glide slowly (or not-so-slowly) down to wherever you want to go. Its a unique take on platforming that I dont recall seeing elsewhere, so the game definitely deserves some credit for that.Likewise, its also got some pretty decent writing. Sure, the whole sassy robot telling you what to do thing has been played out pretty thoroughly by series like Portal and Borderlands, but that doesnt mean that other games cant at least try it. While I wouldnt say that Cloudbase Prime comes close to matching any of the games in either of those franchises, theres still plenty of humour to be found here.And even the games world has a neat look to it. Its a series of minimalist, hexagon-based levels (with each of those hexagons doing the aforementioned launching), and the effect falls somewhere between tech demo (if youre being harsh) and futuristic (if youre feeling generous). Again, not the most original-looking thing in the world, but its still nice and clean-looking.Where the game falls down, though  and why it doesnt succeed in being more than the sum of its parts  is as a shooter. Your weapons feel underpowered, and its hard to be as precise as the game demands of you, particularly since you have to focus so much of your energy and concentration on launching yourself into the air and trying to land squarely on pretty tiny hexagons, all while also gathering up little bots that are scattered around each level. I get that the developers probably wanted to make Cloudbase Prime more than just a game where you jump and glide around  but seeing as they do the jumping and gliding so well, its a shame they couldnt focus on that, rather than allowing their game to be dragged down by something they did not-so-well.But whats done is done, and the end result is a game that couldve been a lot better than it is. Theres enough good stuff present in Cloudbase Prime that its not hard to imagine how the game could be reworked into something significantly better with just a few tweaks, but as it stands, its feels more like a promising demo than a fully fleshed-out game.", "date": "January 18, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
