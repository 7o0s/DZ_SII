While this certainly speaks to my level of gaming competence, in a way it probably says more about my time with Yokus Island Express than anything else I could possibly write.This is because it illustrates the games most notable flaw: its awfully easy to get stuck in spots. This, in turn, is because of how the game is structured. Its part-Metroidvania platformer and part-pinball game, and, more often than not, advancing to another part of the map requires that you figure out how to solve a section that closely resembles a pinball table. As inventive as this is, it also means that unless youre a talented pinball player, youll probably get stuck doing the same loops over and over again pretty frequently.Not only that, because you have to rely on pinball controls so often, youll also find yourself backtracking even more frequently than you would in your typical Metroidvania. On top of the usual back-and-forth that defines the genre, in Yokus Island Express you also have to factor in the fact that, much of the time, its hard to control where youre going. If youve ever complained about a d-pad or thumbsticks, just wait until you experience controlling your character with pinball flippers.As you can imagine, it can be frustrating. But  and this is a very important but its not so frustrating that I was ever tempted to give up on the game.A bit part of my willingness to push through those moments of frustration can be chalked up to that aforementioned inventiveness. Yokus Island Express definitely draws some inspiration from Sonic the Hedgehog, and it does so in a way that recalls the early, nonsense-free days of that franchise. Flying around your screen at high speeds will never not be fun, and being able to do so in a big, open world like the one you find here only adds to that feeling.Even more than that, though, its easy to fall in love with Yokus Island Express because its just so loveable. Youre playing as as an adorable little bug, rolling a ball around the titular island, delivering letters to the various inhabitants and solving their problems. Everything you encounter, from other animals to the environments, is brightly-coloured and brimming with life, and its hard not to get sucked into the feeling of joy that permeates this game.In other words, Yokus Island Express is kind of a testament to the power of positivity. Sure, itll leave you frustrated at times. But its frustration borne out of wanting to experience more of this delightful world, and thats more than enough to keep me pushing through those brief moments of annoyance.", "date": "August 27, 2018", "grade": "B+"}
