{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tri-force-heroes-review-for-nintendo-3ds/", "text": "If theres one thing Ive always admired about Nintendo, its that theyre not afraid to move longstanding IP out of its comfort zone  even Zelda. In the case of Wind Wakers bout of cel-shading, for instance, they even took fans along for the ride, but whats even more noteworthy is that these drastic moves are almost always earned  rather than some publicity stunt. The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes isnt on a time warp back into the Gamecube generation of paradigm shifts, but it is one of the more divergent in a long line of traditionally-structured adventures featuring Link.You could easily start piecing together that Tri Force Heroes is a game focused more on the mechanics than a backstory and lengthy story arc, if only going by the front of the box, but the opening moments are quick to establish this as an actual goal. The plot is wacky right off the bat, introducing players to the fashion-oriented land of Hytopia and its recently despondent princess whos been stripped of her wardrobe and flair by an evil witch  possibly to never again inspire citizens to pursue a life of fashion. Certainly, a hero should appear, and presumably defeat the witch to restore all things to their correct order.As it just so happens, thats exactly how things develop, and within a few minutes, the game has dropped you into the town square to get your bearings and start dungeon crawling. If Tri Force heroes has anything figured out, its that its players are likely to know what a Zelda game is, and even more likely to know how its played. The controls are simplified to accommodate a more action-arcade design (similar in mapping to A Link Between Worlds) and Nintendo is quick to use familiarity to our benefit. You wont find any lengthy or deliberately idiot-proof tutorials in here  in fact, its almost the opposite.The gameplay itself involves what could be approximated to questing in an MMO. Players have eight different worlds to choose from, composed of four different levels (and 4 stages within each level) in which theyll be solving puzzles, vanquishing foes, and upon completion, each awarded with a material to use in crafting new outfits. This material distribution is between three chests, with at least one containing a component different than the other two. Not to dismiss the importance of gathering Hytopian Silk at the end of a level, but youll need to play through at least a second time for the chance to snap up that Octorok Sucker you keep missing out on.Luckily, the puzzles are well-designed, and dungeon runs usually last between 10-15 minutes per level. Its engaging to play, and as well, to replay areas. This is supplemented by providing players with various challenges in completed worlds, such as fewer heart containers, or a time limit.Collecting the proper materials can be used to build costumes, a thematic gimmick that in a chicken-or-the-egg fashion could be a result (or product) of the games fashion-oriented plot, but nonetheless grant abilities to the player. Certain outfits will either enhance items, abilities, or provide general buffs to the team. Theyre also kind of cute, but mostly theyre costumes and fun to wear.Whether or not youll end up playing the level youre looking to clear, among other things, can depend on the other two people youre playing it with. In fact, a lot can depend on two other players, considering that the entire game is designed around the scheme of three players are in the level at the same time.The mandatory Tri Force Heroes co-op is no secret, and though weve only now addressed it in the review, theres actually very little to say that couldnt be guessed by this strict design philosophy. The short of it is that youll be playing with two other people locally or online, and if neither are an option, then the game gives you Doppels to lug around. Doppels, as their name suggest, are stand-ins for Link  creepy dummy versions that in single-player will be swapped between to fulfill the same tasks that three players would complete simultaneously. Youll carry them around, warp between them, and need to hit the checkpoint with all in tow just as if they were other players. If it sounds like a racket, it is, but its also somehow easier to do it all yourself in some instances than to collaborate with players online via emoticons.Interestingly, Nintendo made allowances for what the Doppels will and wont be able to do, in that they dont take damage when not in use, and that if Link is carrying any in totem-pole fashion, that the topmost Doppel can operate their special item or general attack while being driven around by the player controlling the bottom. I say this is interesting because it means that the developers made a decision to accommodate three or one players by way of mechanics, rather than to scale level design down to an intermediate two-player solution for a much more accessible range of multiplayer numbers. Who can say which approach required more work, and ideally something would be present to consider those playing alone or with just a second person, but thats how the single-player Doppel solution turned out.I personally found boss fights more engaging with other players, but puzzle solving to be more manageable on my own than with players over the internet. This touches on one other aspect, which is that I dont know two other people nearby with a 3DS, or even a 2DS. This is a shame in general, but especially when taking into account that Tri Force Heroes supports local download play. Its one of those great features by necessity that Tri Force heroes would suffer significantly for had it been omitted, but shows how tremendously committed Nintendo is to this being a game best played locally with two other friends.In fact, had I played with two other friends (even online), the measure of fun I had would have been exponentially greater than how I managed to enjoy the game on my lonesome. Even the word lonesome seems heavier now after knowing what Im missing out on, despite having only positive interactions with players online. In a stroke of remarkable irony, reviewing Tri Force Heroes succeeded most in making me feel not only as if I dont have friends to play with, but that I have no friends at all and that an online community has always been a stand-in for a real-life social life.Im torn on Tri Force Heroes, because I really do enjoy its brevity and game design. The visuals pop, online play is surprisingly smooth and reliable (aside from a few disconnects on other players parts), and the music is energetic and catchy. Even the writing seems like its having fun, pegging Link for a hero based on his look (later played for laughs with a character featuring the 80s design not fitting the part). Nearly everything in Tri Force Heroes is on vacation, and its great to see a Zelda game let its hair down. Ego takes a backseat and play is the primary goal.On the other hand is the whole three-player thing. Its wonderfully thoughtful with some very clever puzzles, even involving the players themselves as conduits and pawns in certain situations, but Nintendo is too strong in design to cheapen their Four Swords successor by not accommodating two players. Its admirable that theyre committed to the three-player game plan, but in boldness theyve left players with unwanted concessions. Youll either be playing online, with local friends, or alone with Doppels  staring dumbly from the screen to remind you of whats missing.", "date": "November 2, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
