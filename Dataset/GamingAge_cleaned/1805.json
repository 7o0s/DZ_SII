And by people like me, I mean people who have little to no experience with anime in general, or Dragon Ball Z in particular. I loved Asuras Wrath, I enjoyed One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2, and I have vague memories of watching Astro Boy at some point in the mid- to late-80s, but if my life depended on telling you a single thing about Goku, Vegeta and Co., Id be a goner.Ordinarily, this probably wouldnt be an issue. I mean, even if I didnt totally get all the nuances of that aforementioned One Piece game, it still had some nods towards a plot structure that meant I could more or less get a handle on what was going on. In Battle of Z, by contrast, theres none of that. Every single level plops you and a few other characters down, then some more characters show up, and you fight. Occasionally they say a few things to each other, but if theyre saying stuff thats advancing some kind of story, its totally lost on me. At the risk of stereotyping, I get that fan service is big for anime-centred games, but Battle of Z seems to take that to an extreme, in that, as far as I can tell, its nothing but fan service. (Or, alternatively, it really is just a bunch of random characters thrown together, and none of it makes any sense even if you are a fan of the seriesbut seeing as Im the novice here, it seems wise to give the games developers the benefit of the doubt.)This lack of story is kind of a shame, because the game itself is kind of enjoyable. Im a bit of a sucker for superhero games, and its hard to think of something more superheroic than flying around, punching people through rocks and firing laser beams out of your hands. Sure, it gets a little repetitive after awhile, seeing as a) the environments dont change all that much and b) theres no apparent rhyme or reason for why, exactly, youre flying around punching bad (or, possibly, good?) guys, but its still a heck of a lot of fun in small doses  and, thankfully, for the most part small doses is what Battle of Z offers, with even the longest levels being over and done with in about fifteen minutes.Of course, even in bite-sized chunks, the games combat limitations are noticeable. Theres one button for melee attacks and one button for long-range attacks, and even if the names of those attacks may vary from character to character, they dont change all that much. You can modify them slightly to make them a little more powerful or more accurate  but even then, they only change the attacks into slightly more supercharged punches, kicks and laserbeams.", "date": "February 6, 2014", "grade": "B"}
