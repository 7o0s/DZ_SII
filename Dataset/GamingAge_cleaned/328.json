{"name": "Fast Striker", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/12/fast-striker-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "While I cant say this with absolute certainty, Id be willing to bet that Fast Striker is the only game whose list of platforms consists of the Neo Geo MVS, Sega Dreamcast, and, now, PS4 and the Vita. If thats not a unique combination, I dont know what would be.Mind you, thats also the only thing thats remotely unique about Fast Striker.In every other respect, this is as paint-by-numbers a shmup as youre ever likely to see. Youre piloting a rocket ship, shooting lasers at enemies coming from all sides of the screen, and you have to dodge all the obstacles in your way. Theres the odd secret to uncover, but none of them are even remotely interesting or change the gameplay in any way. Everything moves so quickly that the screen quickly becomes an eyesore, but at the same time, nothing is so visually interesting that it stands out.If youre looking for anything positive  beyond the fact that it works  there is the fact that you have the option of playing on a compressed screen to mimic the feeling of playing it at an arcade. And you also have four different difficulty options, which range from incredibly easy to controller-smashingly hard, which means that, in theory, the game is accessible for everyone from newcomers to shmup veterans.But I dont know why youd bother with Fast Striker unless you had a shmup-related compulsion. As I said up top, the only thing interesting about it is the list of platforms on which its appeared, and once you get beyond the five seconds itll take you to read that and say, Huh, interesting, to yourself, youll have exhausted everything worth knowing about this game.", "date": "December 14, 2018", "grade": "C-"}
