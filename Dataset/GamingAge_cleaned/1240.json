{"name": "Phineas and Ferb: Day of Doofenshmirtz", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/12/phineas-ferb-day-doofenshmirtz-review-ps-vita/", "text": "I can imagine why you might be skeptical about the quality of Phineas and Ferb: Day of Doofenshmirtz. After all, its not just a game targeting a younger demographic, its a licensed game: the combination of those two things may understandably fill you with dread. Its important to remember, however, that there are plenty of examples of licensed kids games that didnt suck  including the last Phineas and Ferb game to grace PlayStation consoles, Phineas and Ferb Across the Second Dimension  which is why you shouldnt go in expecting it to be terrible.Of course, if you reach that conclusion after actually playing the game, I wouldnt blame you. Thats certainly how Im feeling about it now, after having spent several hours with it.Okay, perhaps calling it terrible may be a bit harsh. I know Ive played worse 3D platformers, even if none are jumping to mind right at this very second. But if youre looking for reasons to dislike the game, they abound.First and foremost, theres the profoundly mediocre gameplay. While Phineas and Ferb: Day of Doofenshmirtz doesnt do anything really badly, it doesnt do anything particularly well, either. Every aspect of movement  running, jumping, shooting  feels stiff and unresponsive, and things arent helped by the artificial barriers the game throws in your way. You dont get to double-jump until well into the games second chapter; you have to feel your way along invisible, arbitrary walls blocking you from exploring the rigid path the game has set before you; you cant fire your weapon if youre standing too close to anything: in all of these ways and more, youre constantly reminded of the games limits. Im not saying I want a giant, open Tri-State Area to explore, but I dont think its ridiculous to be annoyed by little things like being able to walk on one side of the street but not the other.(And dont even get me started on the way the game arbitrarily stops you from reaching certain areas that clearly have goodies. I understand wanting to pad out the length a little by making players go back and replay levels, but that doesnt make it any less stupid that you can jump on top of a box, but you cant jump over a fence while standing on top of a park bench simply because there are more coins to collect on the other side of the fence. And the way Day of Doofenschmirtz allows you to sparingly use a jetpackI feel like just shaking my head in frustration is the only reasonable response.)This mediocrity extends to every other aspect of the game, too. Its nothing special to look at, with graphics that could be described as bland if they didnt include so many headache-inducing colours. (I get that the cartoon looks equally odd, but the way its rendered here has all of the ugliness and none of the charm.) The music? Highly repetitive, but not in any way that youll remember within a few seconds of turning off the game. And its entirely possible the story makes some sense if youre an avid watcher of the TV show, but if youre not a fan, I dont think this forgettable nonsense is going to turn you into one.", "date": "December 11, 2015", "grade": "C"}
