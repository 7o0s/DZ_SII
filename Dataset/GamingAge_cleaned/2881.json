In fact, it predates those games by roughly a decade, having first been released in Japan on PC in 2002. Ive got to admit: it doesnt mean all that much to me. Even though I played both of those games (for the record, I liked Mask of Deception, and I wasnt so fond of Mask of Truth), I barely remember a thing about either of them. Just about the only things I really recall are that they were both incredibly wordy, even by the standards of visual novels, and that they were somewhat unique in the genre because of the fact that they occasionally forayed into turn-based battles. Both of those things remain true here. The story is pretty generic, as these things go: its about an amnesiac, Hakuowlo, who wakes up in the middle of a rural Japanese village where many of the villagers seem to be part-animal, and slowly  and I do mean sloooooowly  falls in love, fights battles, and finds his destiny. Everything may have carried a little more weight if I remembered what happened in the other two games, but as it stands, it just felt like Prelude to the Fallen tended to get bogged down in meandering chapters that never really went anywhere.It would be an exaggeration to say that the battles broke up the monotony, because theyre very, very few and far between. Hours pass before you get your first action, and even thats basically just a tutorial which will be familiar if youve ever played a strategic RPG that features any turn-based battles. From that point, its hours more until the next battle, and somewhere along the way youll probably realize that if youre after action of any kind, this probably isnt the game for you. On the action side, Ill also note Prelude to the Fallen tries to mix things up by including Chain Attacks. While theyre kind of neat, theyre also so few and far between that I cant say they make a huge difference in the big scheme of things.", "date": "September 10, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
