I know Im normally pretty vague as it is, but in the case of Oxenfree I have twice as many reasons as usual to be a little vague: not only do I not want to spoil it, Im also not entirely sure I totally understood the game.That said, by the end of it I was feeling a little let down by the game, which means some degree of spoilage is inevitable. So: youve been warned.Ready? Last chance to back out. If you dont want to even skim a vague spoiler, you can know that I gave Oxenfree a B and you dont have to scroll any further.Okay.My problem with Oxenfree is that it spends a couple of hours building a really interesting ghost story. (I think  it may have been aliens. Either way, there was some excellent plot-building going on for about the first 95% of the game.) Then you reach the climax, you prepare to confront the games antagonistsand, suddenly, you wake up on a boat and find that youve skipped over whatever drove away said aliens/ghosts, and youve won. Maybe. Possibly. The game is a little ambiguous on that point.It all feels as if developers Night School Studios went into their game hoping to come up with a satisfactory ending sometime before they finished it, then as deadlines drew near and they realized they still didnt have anything, they went with an ending thats one step above It was all a dreamor was it?! (And, truth be told, they even manage to work that fate in, at least with the ending I got.) It feels like a massive sellout of everything thats come before it, since up to that point, theyve done a phenomenal job of doing everything almost perfectly.The dialogue, for example, is exceptional. Very, very few games know how to make their characters sound believable. Fewer still are able to craft believable dialogue coming out of the mouths of teenagers. Yet Oxenfree pretty much nails it. The rhythms sound realistic, theres little in the way of infodumps, and the Altmanesque way they talk over each other sounds true to life. If theres a flaw, its in the way your opportunity to chime in and respond is usually time-limited, but thats a small price to pay for having conversations that flow naturally.Similarly, the game looks gorgeous, with 2.5D visuals that pop off the screen. No one is ever going to mistake it for real life obviously, but as with the dialogue, the game mostly feels true-to-life  except when the aliens/ghosts make an appearance and make everything go screwy, at which point everything becomes appropriately discombobulated. Considering they dont have a full three dimensions to work with, Night School needed to be inventive to make those off-kilter moments seem appropriately spooky; their solution  to mimic the way old VHS tapes looked when the tracking went off  is engaging and ingenious, and it adds to the creepy atmosphere perfectly.Above all else, though, theres the gameplay. Oxenfree is an adventure game, but theres no combine random object A with random object E to get random tool M in sight. Instead, the game pushes you to explore its mysterious island at your own place. Helpfully highlighting most of the key features while at the same time hiding just enough that it rewards exploration and experimentation, Oxenfree works for both hardened adventure gamers and those that just want to play through and enjoy the story.", "date": "February 23, 2016", "grade": "B"}
