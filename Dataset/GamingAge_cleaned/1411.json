{"name": "Operation Abyss: New Tokyo Legacy", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/06/operation-abyss-new-tokyo-legacy-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "The fact that Operation Abyss: New Tokyo Legacy is made by the same people who created Demon Gaze may just be the least surprising thing ever. They are, broadly speaking, basically the same game: both are first-person dungeon crawlers in which you take on enemies in turn-based battles. Yes, in Operation Abyss you do so with a team of Japanese students instead of with a single student. And yes, Operation Abyss finds you battling monsters instead of demons. But at their core, theyre more or less the same game.Good thing, then, that theres more to Operation Abyss than just its core.See, where Demon Gaze was the very definition of mediocre and uninspiring, Operation Abyss is actually pretty decent. Part of this, Ill admit, comes down to personal tolerance for fanservice: where Demon Gaze had its fair share of the stuff, theres not a whole lot of it here. While there are certainly your usual trope characters, Operation Abyss generally refrains from all the worst stereotypes, and in doing so doesnt leave you with the same kind of dirty feeling you had (okay, I had) after playing Demon Gaze.I think, though, that Operation Abyss is better for reasons other than simply personal preference, however. I think its better becausewell, because every aspect is better in every way. The controls are easier, the fights go more smoothly, the story is easier to follow. In every respect, its clear that developers Experience Inc. took the lessons learned from Demon Gaze, and put them to good use here.", "date": "June 10, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
