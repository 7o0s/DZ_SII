{"name": "Frozen Synapse Prime", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/10/frozen-synapse-prime-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Its probably because Ive been playing the two games alongside each other, but I cant help but think of Frozen Synapse Prime as the anti-Natural Doctrine. After all, even though theyre both strategy games, its hard to think of anything else the two games have in common. I mean, just look at them: Natural Doctrine looks like a rough synthesis of every other modern Japanese RPG, whereas Frozen Synapse Prime is all sleek and shiny. In terms of aesthetics, its the difference between medieval warriors and futuristic robot warriors.Of course, the differences run deeper than that (which is why the comparison seems so appropriate to me). Natural Doctrine is a game obsessed with being played in just the right way; if you dont do things in precisely the order it demands you to, itll simply kill you off and make you start over again. Frozen Synapse Prime, by contrast, is all about letting you do what you want. Theres a brief tutorial at the beginning, but after that, youre on your own. It tells you a bit of story via dialogues, it gives you a scenario, then youre on your own.Im not saying that such an approach is perfect, because its not. It obviously leads to a whole lot of trial and error, right from the get-go, as you gradually feel out what works and what doesnt. If you want a game that holds your hand, this clearly isnt it. But you know what? After playing a game (Natural Doctrine) that not only holds your hand but smacks it down hard the moment you try a little experimentation, a bit of freedom is awfully nice.Not only that, its nice to play a game where the deck isnt stacked against you. The enemies here may be able to kill you on sight, but the good news is, you can do the same to them. Youre not going to come up against some absurdly overpowered foe, nor are you going to have to grind and grind and grind until you reach a certain level. Compared to other strategy RPGs, thats a pretty welcome change.", "date": "October 6, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
