Outright Games output as a publisher isnt exactly filled with GOTY candidates, and their last DC game, DC League of Super-Pets, was a dull, repetitive on-rails shooter. While I was hoping for Cosmic Chaos to be better, I still wasnt expecting all that much. Turns out, the game surpassed even my wildest expectations: its good. In fact, heres how much I enjoyed Justice League: Cosmic Chaos: my only complaint about it is that theres no co-op in story mode, which means you cant play through it with any kids who might want to play it with you. Theres an Instant Action mode, where you can go in and beat up the bad guys, but its really not the same.This is because while the gameplay is fine, where Justice League: Cosmic Chaos really shines is in its story. Or, more specifically, in how the story  about Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman trying to thwart Mr. Mxyzptlks nefarious plans for Happy Harbour (the location of the Justice Leagues Secret Sanctuary, obviously)  allows plenty of time for DCs holy trinity to banter back and forth. And, believe it or not, that banter is frequently hilarious. You have Superman being a font of corny jokes, Batman making frequent references to a backstory thats awfully weird if you think about it for even a moment, and Wonder Woman constantly trying to keep the other two on track. Add all that together, plus the inclusion of Mr. Mxyzptlk adding in his own jokes  which, again, are surprisingly funny  and you have the recipe for one of the more amusing games Ive played in quite some time.To be sure, the game is helped by a very, very good voice-acting cast. Both Wonder Woman and Batman are voiced by actors whove done those characters before in various animated series and consequently know them well (Vanessa Marshall and Diedrich Bader, respectively), while Nolan North as Superman nails Supermans goofy persona. Couple that with Dana Snyder essentially using Mr Mxyzptlk as a reason to reprise his role as Master Shake in Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and you can see why Im so high on Justice League: Cosmic Chaos from that perspective.As for the gameplay, it will seem fairly familiar to anyone whos ever played other superhero team-up games like Justice League Heroes, X-Men Legends, or the Marvel: Ultimate Alliance series. You have an isometric point of view, you battle waves of enemies as you explore the world, you switch between characters depending on what abilities you want to use: its not ground-breaking, but it works well enough.In fact, Id say its more than good enough, since its easy enough to pick up that it doesnt get in the way of the fun story. Again, itd be nice if Justice League: Cosmic Chaos allowed you to play through that story with a friend (or, better still, a son/daughter/niece/nephew just getting into gaming), but even as a solo experience, this is a surprisingly good time.", "date": "March 20, 2023", "grade": "A-"}
