It went up on Kickstarter way back in June 2013, with a promised release date of 2014.That didnt happen. In late 2015, Zeboyd Games showcased a playable version at PlayStation Experience, promising an early 2016 release date. That didnt happen either. After the PS4 version came out in April 2017, I think most people  notwithstanding the developers promises to the contrary  suspected that the Vita version would be quietly and unceremoniously killed off.And then, against all hopes, odds, and expectations, here were are in 2018, and Cosmic Star Heroine has finally made it to Sonys handheld.I dont know that Id say that the finished product is quite worth the five-year wait (or four years, if youre feeling generous). I mean, what game possibly could be? But I can say that Cosmic Star Heroine is one of the better RPGs to be released on the Vita  and considering the quality of RPGs weve seen on system over its lifespan, thats saying something.I think this has to do with the development teams mindset. Zeboyd promised a Japanese-style RPG inspired by the likes of Chrono Trigger and Phantasy Star, and its not hard to see those games in this ones DNA. At the same time, however, theres none of the bad traits youd usually associate with JRPGs and their ilk.By this I mean theres no excessive grinding. Theres no lengthy exposition dumps where characters monologue endlessly. You dont have to go back and defeat the same enemies over and over again just to earn enough XP to big bigger and badder enemies. Its a JRPG experience, but a streamlined one.Thats not to say that theres not still a lot of game here. Cosmic Star Heroine features a big, expansive story about a futuristic police force whose leadership has some evil intentions, and its filled to the brim with solid characters and engaging dialogue. Even more importantly, its genuinely fun to play: Im not usually someone who cares all that much for turn- or party-based combat, but this game features that in spades, and I cant say I minded it once. This undoubtedly goes back to those characters, who each offer a range of unique attacks, and who  thanks to that whole no grinding thing  always feel like theyre appropriately-powered in every situation.As I said, Im not sure why or how the game took five years to go from Kickstarter promise to Vita reality. But, now that its here, I cant say that Im bothered all that much. This is a fantastic game, and ultimately, thats the only thing that matters.", "date": "July 6, 2018", "grade": "A+"}
