{"name": "Omensight", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/07/omensight-review-for-ps4-pc/", "text": "I like the idea of Omensight a lot more than I actually like Omensight itself. It describes itself as an action adventure murder mystery, and, surprisingly, it mostly delivers on that promise. Playing as a mysterious mystical warrior named The Harbinger, you work your way through a branching narrative in order to prevent the apocalypse. The twist? You keep getting pulled out of reality just before the end comes, so you can go back and relive the day from another perspective.As I said, I love that idea. As was the case with the likes of Tacoma or The Invisible Hours, I think its fun to see games play around with time in a way that only they can.The problem is that for it to really work, you need a compelling story. And quite frankly, I dont think that can be said for Omensight.Dont get me wrong, its definitely a complex story, which is necessary if you want to tell a story like Omensight aims to tell. Its got loads of characters, and you can tell that a lot of thought has gone into the games world-building. But, as any sci-fi or fantasy reader could tell you, theres a difference between world-building and storytelling, and I dont think Omensight crosses that divide. Its the same issue that plagues lots of visual novels  they spend lots of time telling you the lore via monologues and exposition dumps, but they never make a good case for why you should care in the first place.It certainly doesnt help that youre essentially seeing the same story play out multiple times from multiple angles. If you arent drawn in by the story one time, hearing it several more times with more details probably isnt going to do the trick.The feeling of repetition also isnt helped by the gameplay itself  hack & slash action games can feel repetitive even at the best of times, so hacking and slashing your way through the same story time and again definitely wont do much to shake that feeling.On a related note, playing the same stories time and again means you visit the same locations time and again, which in turn means reminding you again and again that the camera here is occasionally atrocious. It mostly follows your character, but every so often youll go around a corner or youll want a better sense of where youre jumping, but the fixed camera means neither of those things are possible.Having written all thatby no means is Omensight a bad game. If youre into the story and the lore, in fact, I can see being able to overlook the action and the camera  neither is great, but nor are they the worst things ever. Personally, Im not going to stay awake at night wondering how to uncover a few pieces of the story I may have missed, but there are certainly worse games you could agonize over.", "date": "July 20, 2018", "grade": "B"}
