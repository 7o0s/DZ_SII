Id never played any of the Civilization games before, but by reputation I knew them to be both insanely addictive and fairly hardcore in terms of strategy. While the former didnt bother me too much  I sank approximately 500 hours or so into MLB 10: The Shows career mode, so Im totally used to addictive repetition  the latter definitely gave me pause, seeing as my gaming strategies generally tend towards the run in, guns ablazing, damn the consequences school of thinking.Because of that combination of unfamiliarity and lack of strategic thinking ability, youll probably want to take this review with at least a few pinches of salt. For one thing, it means I cant tell you exactly how faithfully the proper Civilization Revolution 2 experience is recreated on the Vita, since I have absolutely no idea. For another, it means that I almost certainly didnt play the game to the absolute fullest extent thats possible, on account of the fact Im pretty sure I suck at it.Having said all thatmy goodness, CivRev 2+ is fun. I totally see how people could sink hours upon hours into it. I regularly found myself starting up a scenario as soon as I got on the bus for work, only to look up and realize I needed to hurriedly get up and rush to the doors so as to avoid missing my stop. I dont know how much this version took from the original version of CivRev2, but it clearly took enough that it can sink its claws into you and make it so that you forget everything else.In this respect, the game is pretty much perfect for the Vita. You never need to worry about having to stop a particularly tough battle halfway through, since you can literally take it everywhere you go. If pesky things like bus stops get in the way, you can just momentarily suspend your game, then pick it up again as soon as you get another free moment. The controls  for the most part  are easy to pick up and remember, so you never have to worry about re acclimating yourself to the game. There are no plots or stories you need to keep track of. If theres any game more suited to handheld gaming, I dont think Ive yet discovered it.Which isnt to say that CivRev2+ is the best handheld game Ive ever played, or that its flawless. Most obviously, there are times where the performance is a little suboptimal. When you get into a scenerios later stages, and the world is filling up with cities and soldiers and settlers, movements start to feel and look a little sluggish. And on a non-gameplay level, the game could stand to do a little more in terms of explaining some things to newcomers  case in point being the fact I never figured out how to transport anything across oceans, which made for a slightly long game when I found my starting city alone on an island, and I was forced to win over the world solely on the strength of my culture.", "date": "June 29, 2016", "grade": "A-"}
