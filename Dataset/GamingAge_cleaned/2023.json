{"name": "Mini Words Collection", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/04/mini-words-collection-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Mini Words Collection does something that I thought was impossible: it makes word games boring.I mean, I know thats how a lot of people find them, but Im crazy about word games. Even when dont love them, I still get some enjoyment out of them. With Mini Words Collection, the most I can muster up is indifference.Mind you, I get the sense that Mini Words Collection isnt really made for people who already speak English. If you check out its eShop page, youll find that it proudly proclaims that one of the games included, Pathfinders, is (g)reat for the little ones learning English, while Mini Words itself boasts that it includes enough words to cover 90% of conversations in English.Theres nothing wrong with gamifying linguistic learning  as someone who just reached 900 days in my Duolingo French, Im certainly in no position to bash it. And if youre just learning English, Mini Words Collection could be a good way to learn some of the more basic words. But even then, its worth noting that you wont find out how to use the words youve learned  theres no conjugating verbs or anything. Its just straight up spelling.I should also note that the collection includes one other game, Polyglot, which varies from the other two only in that it asks you to translate words in other languages into English. While its kind of interesting to see how different words get translated, the game loses its allure pretty quickly once you see that youre really just doing the same thing over and over again  much like youre doing in the other two games.If you just want to learn to spell, I guess, that makes Mini Words Collection kind of an attractive proposition. If, however, youre a fan of word puzzles and you want anything thatll challenge you in the least, then keep looking, because youre not going to find that here.", "date": "April 12, 2022", "grade": "C-"}
