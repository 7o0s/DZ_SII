{"name": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  Hearts of Stone Expansion", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/12/witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-stone-expansion-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "To date, much has been said about The Witcher 3, and most of its been rather good. Its both a wonderfully-constructed open-world game which runs well, and one with generally satisfactory gameplay, but if theres one point of praise that stands out of the series as a whole, its the writing. The folks at CD Projekt RED have a firm grasp on the Witcher universe, and have never wasted a players time with dialog nor written word  an impressive feat when considering how much of it may go unnoticed, or even how low the bar is set for game writing in general.It is for this reason that the Hearts of Stone expansion (being the first of a planned two) is tricky to discuss, as the content is largely story-based, but luckily for anyone who enjoyed The Witcher 3, its a satisfactory story-based chunk of questing thats well worth their time.Ill leave it at that, for anyone who wants an idea of the general value based on an aspect of the game, and continue ahead with a warning that light spoilers await.Picking up at around level 30, the best way to describe where players exist at the tail end of The Witcher 3, Hearts of Stone adds a few new quests to a notice board where some DLC-excusive contracts await. Among these minor quest additions, were introduced to some new and old faces, beginning with the introduction of the bandit Olgierd von Everec and his request that Geralt slay a beast in some nearby sewers. Aside from the care put into Olgierds design and voice acting, its a by-the-book quest that perfectly hits the spot after coming off the game a few months ago, and even reminiscent of Witcher 1-style contracts  running around the sewers to kill some thing thats been eating some people for a reward hopefully worth your time.Or perhaps its Shanis return that harkens back to the first game, as Geralts brief run-in with her when starting the quest reintroduces her to the series. Back in the day, things didnt go so well between Shani and I, and a lesser developer probably would have shoehorned some relationship decision dialog in Hearts of Stone to re-establish that, but in The Witcher 3, the past is the past and adults move on with a better understanding of themselves. More on that later.Upon slaying the beast, Geralt soon finds a simple task becoming less simple and likely ending a lot later than expected  or at least as long as being in another jail cell could last. Its between a rock and a hard place that Hearts of Stone calls back to May of 2015, (re)introducing Gaunter ODimm, a character who  and I look forward to replaying The Witcher 3 some day to see this play out  claims to have played a key part in White Orchard when Geralt was searching for Yennefer. While Im sure someone has written a Wikipedia entry or put a video on Youtube about the verification of ODimm being in White Orchard at Witcher 3s beginning, its a delight to see a game sneak someone totally forgettable into a major quest planned far in advance. Before were finished asking Who? and Really?, weve got no other choice but to believe him and take a helping hand.Its beyond this point that Gaunter ODimms interest in helping Geralt reveals the fine print weve been waiting for, and exposes some sinister dealings between ODimm and Olgierd which now involve Geralt as a proxy. Theres something uniquely Cold War about the ongoing standoff between ODimm and Olgierd, in that as a third party its not clear whos more dangerous for quite a while, and still keeping in line with the Witcher universe, both parties ultimately turn to you to pull the trigger aimed at the other.CD Projekt REDs knack for stitching Geralt into other peoples problems is rare in that even in their most basic contrivance, it still feels earned somehow. Maybe it has to do with this work being a part of Geralts job, but whatever the extra oomph is behind their storytelling, the story and scenarios in Hearts of Stone have a great layering to them that stands out among game writing, and most writing in general. One particular part of the DLC involves a wedding reception where Geralt kills two birds with one stone by attending as a guest  a fairly lighthearted task. While the immediate goal of having a good time is of primary concern, were reminded halfway through that this is a brief holiday from the feud between ODimm and Olgierd thanks to ODimm sneaking himself into the celebration. Whether this characters intent is malignant or not has yet to be determined at this point, but his mischievous nature is a great counterpoint to what could otherwise flounder into a paint-by-numbers relationship subplot with Shani  only for the evening to rediscover the importance it deserves once he departs. By the time the this sections last few cutscenes have resolved, weve recharged our batteries and return to the quest with a sober head.As mentioned, Hearts of Stone has a handful of contracts, treasure hunts, and side quests for players to pad out their time without exhausting the main quest, but it also introduces some new loot and the Runewright  a new craftsman who can enchant weapons with Runewords and Glyphwords. While this may hold potential for some players, I hardly used the guy despite having fully expanded his store. At the very least, hes there now and gives some more flexibility to customizing equipment, but as someone who never fiddled around much with runes, served to serve no real purpose aside from completing the quest of giving him enough money to call it a day.Its difficult to find issues with Hearts of Stone as a singular piece of content, but it is worth mentioning that with the game set at its highest difficulty, Death March, many battles become protracted exercises in dying and loading the most recent save file. I was disappointed to have finished The Witcher 3 on this difficulty only to lower the setting in order to progress at a reasonable pace for review purposes. Theres no point in playing Hearts of Stone on the hardest setting if youre achievement-hunting, and its worth bypassing an unbalanced difficulty level for the tradeoff of actually making progress over having your pride hurt.", "date": "December 30, 2015", "grade": "A"}
