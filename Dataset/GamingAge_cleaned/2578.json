{"name": "Two Point Hospital: Jumbo Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/08/two-point-hospital-jumbo-edition-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "As much as I enjoy playing management sims, Ive noticed theres a pretty common thread that runs through all of them: when you play them on consoles  be it PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch  they dont seem to run or play quite as smoothly as I assume they do on PC. It doesnt matter if were talking Tropico, or Civilization, or even Kerbal Space Program, you can always see the compromises that have been made to get text- and menu-heavy games to work with more traditional gaming controls.Given that my previous attempts at playing a hospital sim on the Switch were disastruous, I went into Two Point Hospital: Jumbo Edition with somewhat low expectations. Sure it looked fun  and the base version that came out last year was well-received  but would it really be worthwhile?Short answer: yes, absolutely.Actually, thats pretty much my longer answer, too. Two Point Hospital isnt just charming and funny, its also highly addictive, largely because of how well its controls work on the Switch. Even though youre charged with building and staffing an entire hospital, the game somehow never overwhelms you with hard-to-read menus, nor does it make it a massive chore to design things exactly as you want. It just works, easily and intuitively.Which is a good thing, because the Jumbo part of the title is well-earned. There are a lot of hospitals at your disposal in this game  on top of all the locations available in the regular Two Point Hospital, there are four expansions included here, which include about two dozen new hospitals and several new scenarios. If it were to feel like you were fighting with the controls the whole time, it would drain all the fun out of the game  but, again, because the game feels intuitive, its constantly fun.Of course, Two Point Hospital is also constantly fun because its funny and cute. Whether its the staff (each of whom come with their own backstories and personality traits), or the illnesses (theres Heart Throb, for example, which can be identified when a patient becomes incredibly sexy, or Lightheadedness, where their heads become lightbulbs, or Monobrow, where a unibrow basically becomes a sentient being), or even the treatments (Jest Infections, which can be spotted by clown-like tendencies, naturally require a trip to the Dehumorfier), this game is brimming with good humour. You dont usually associate management sims with being consistently funny, but Two Point Hospital shows that its possible even within this genre.Obviously, if you played Two Point Hospital last year, picking up the Jumbo Edition probably isnt necessary (particularly since you could just get the DLC thats included here). But if, like me, you somehow skipped out on it, now is the time to remedy that oversight, and get Two Point Hospital: Jumbo Edition stat.", "date": "August 13, 2021", "grade": "A"}
