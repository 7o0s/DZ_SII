Visual novel with an artstyle heavily indebted to Pop Art? Check. Overwrought dialogue? You know it. Abnormally busty 18-year-old telepath solving a supernatural mystery? Obviously.In fact, the only real difference is that if youre the type who likes Trophies or Achievements, its actually even easier to get them all in Ghost In The Castle than it was in Full Moon  which is kind of astounding, since you could get the Full Moon Platinum in under half an hour. The difference is that Ghost In The Castle doesnt tie any of its Trophies to minigames; seeing as the minigames were probably the worst part of the Full Moon, thats basically addition by subtraction.Of course, the drawback to not requiring players to play minigames is that youre left to focus entirely on the story  and this is a murder mystery that makes Scooby-Doo look like an intricately crafted masterpiece. Mind you, given the developers other offerings, it could have been a lot worse, so I wont complain about it too much.But I also wont rave about Vera Blanc: Ghost In The Castle, either. As I said, its basically the same as the first Vera Blanc, and seeing as you couldve have skipped that without missing anything, you can skip this one, too.", "date": "June 9, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
