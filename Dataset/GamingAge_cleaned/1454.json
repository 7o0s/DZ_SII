{"name": "Toukiden: Kiwami", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/04/toukiden-kiwami-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "I cant say I fully understand why Toukiden: Kiwami exists. Yes, I get that it has a little more content than the original Toukiden: Age of Demons that came out last year. And yes, I understand that by releasing it in both PS4 and Vita, instead of just Vita, it has the potential to reach a much largeroh, wait. Okay, I get it now.Not that I mind too much. After all, the original Toukiden was good  really, really good. So good that I almost definitely gave it far too low a review score a year ago. In fact, since it came out, Ive found myself going back to it again and again, always looking to finish just one more mission or one more quest. I only just deleted it from my memory card a few weeks ago  not coincidentally, right around the time Toukiden: Kiwami came out and I was able to trade one for the other.Is there a huge difference between the two? Not really. The fact this version contains the entire original game should clue you in to the fact that Toukiden: Kiwami is more Toukiden 1.5 than a full-on sequel. The general story  that youre a mysterious warrior helping protect one of the last non-demon-controlled villages in Japan  is the same, as are the controls. There may be more demons, weapons, missions and characters this time around (apparently meaning theres twice as much content here), but at its core, this game is all about the party-based monster hunting.And that, of course, is the one thing most will recognize about Toukiden: Kiwami. Its basically Monster Hunter, only with a enough changes to the basic formula that Capcom wouldnt feel too litigious about it. Tecmo KOEI has essentially admitted as much, saying that they made a Sony-exclusive franchise because Monster Hunter had become exclusive to Nintendo systems.I have to say, though, I kind of prefer Toukiden. Credit the presence of a second thumbstick, credit more interesting visuals, maybe even credit the fact that the monsters here look genuinely monstrous  whatever the reason may be, I find these games a lot more enjoyable than anything the Monster Hunter series has to offer. I realize thats kind of heretical to admit, and I have no doubt that some may scoff, but what can I say? When youre talking about games that are practically identical, simple, impossible-to-rationalize personal preferences can go a long way towards deciding why you like one instead of the other.", "date": "April 17, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
