{"name": "Treehouse Riddle", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/02/treehouse-riddle-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Its a good thing that Nintendo announced that Professor Layton is coming back later this year. If I had to endure many more puzzle games like Treehouse Riddle, that are inspired by the venerable professor but nowhere near as good, I think Id be ready to give up on the genre. Admittedly, thats a little unfair. For one thing, theres plenty of room for games to exist between top of the genre and so bad it shouldnt be a thing, and Treehouse Riddle fits in that vast space. Similarly, Treehouse Riddle has a passing similarity to Layton only in the sense its about an old man and a young girl solving puzzles. It doesnt necessarily need to have a complicated plot thats moved forward by timely puzzles,  la Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask or Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, so it shouldnt be docked too many points for focusing largely on puzzles. Of course, that assumes that Treehouse Riddle has puzzles on par with  or even at least close to  Professor Layton, and thats clearly not the case. The puzzles here seem to be either so ridiculously easy that you can solve them in a few seconds, or so obscure that youll need to read through all the instructions and hints just to get a sense of what the game expects you to do. It should also be noted that the further into the game you get, the more Treehouse Riddle moves from Layton-esque puzzles to straight-up math problems. As someone whose math skills have always been iffy, I cant say I loved those ones  but at the same time, I get why those would appeal to some people, so I wont dismiss them (or the game) just because theyre there.I would dismiss Treehouse Riddle, however, because its just not that interesting a game. It too often feels like youre just doing puzzles for the sake of doing puzzles, and, as other games have shown, theres ways of making that a lot more interesting than its done here.", "date": "February 20, 2023", "grade": "C"}
