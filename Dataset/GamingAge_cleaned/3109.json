{"name": "Strike Force Kitty", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/01/strike-force-kitty-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Even if Strike Force Kitty were the greatest game in the history of everything, Id have a hard time recommending anyone pick it up on the Switch. I mean, its a free Flash-based internet game thats been around for the better part of this decade, that you can play in your browser right now, at this very second  for, again, literally no money. I dont care how much you like buttons, free is a very hard price to beat.As it stands, however, Strike Force Kitty is most decidedly not the greatest game ever, which renders the discussion of Switch versus browser moot. I cant speak to what its like to play this game for zero dollars in Chrome or Firefox or whatever, but I can speak to the Strike Force Kitty Switch experience, and based on that, I feel confident in saying this game sucks.In the games defense, Ill admit that I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing, so I may have just been playing it entirely wrong. There are no tutorials, nor any manuals, so I just kind of figured it out as I went along. I may have missed some crucial gameplay element that would have made it GOTY material.In my defense, however,I dont think thats the case. I think that Strike Force Kitty really is just terrible. Youre given a team of four cats, you dress them up in various costumes that give them various powers, and then you set them free in a side-scrolling world to fight with other cats. Your part in the whole game is to jump occasionally, and, between levels, to train them up, though it never seemed like the training amounted to much. You also can change costumes after you win them from other cats; while the game prides itself on how it skirts around copyright infringement with puns and whatnot, I cant say that they added much to the game.In fact, if anything they underline just how lazy Strike Force Kitty feels. It always comes off as if the game is simply coasting on what others have done before it, whether its the costumes that rip off better-known characters, the graphics that feel like they were lifted straight from Scribblenauts, or the gameplay  which, again, only asks that you jump every so often, while the game plays itself.", "date": "January 8, 2020", "grade": "D"}
