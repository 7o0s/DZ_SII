Its an otome visual novel, which means that its designed to cater to players who like the escapism of boys trying to woo them. As such, any criticisms I have should be taken with a grain of salt.And yet, I feel like Ive played enough of these games that I have some idea of what a good otome looks like. And How to Take Off Your Mask Remastered just isnt that.Like any novel, visual or otherwise, the problem is that these characters arent that interesting. This issue is particularly acute here, seeing as there arent all that many characters to begin with. Somehow, all the characters come off as one-dimensional tropes, which is actually kind of surprising when you take into account the fact that most of them also have multiple personalities. Youd think this would make them seem a little more interestingbut if you think that, youve clearly never played/read one of these games before.I should also add that even by the standards of visual novels, stands out for being especially kawaii. Like, the main character is literally a cat girl, who ends all her sentences with nya. So if youre going to play it, youll need a strong stomach for that sort of thing.Again, I recognize that How to Take Off Your Mask Remastered is clearly not for me, so Im not going to complain too long or too loudly about this. But given that other, better otome games are out there, I just dont know why youd want to play this one instead.", "date": "April 23, 2021", "grade": "C+"}
