{"name": "Pokmon Smile impressions for iOS, Android", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/06/pokemon-smile-impressions-for-ios-android/", "text": "I dont like admitting this, but Ive always been borderline neglectful of my oral hygiene. Many a nights I would pass out for the night without brushing or waking and eating without brushing. After seeing my father have all his teeth removed because of his years of neglect have definitely made me reevaluate my laziness when it comes to dental care. Water picks, mouthwash and even a swear jar-like solution are steps that Ive taken in an attempt to ensure I enter my twilight years with a majority of my teeth intact. So when todays Pokmon Presents lead with Pokmon Smile, even though I doubt I was the intended audience, color me intrigued.Nintendo has had a weird history of putting out software which promotes good health. Wii Fit, Ring Fit Adventure and even a proposed heart beat sensor, the big N has never been shy about releasing oddball software. So its not quite shocking to see one of their child companies follow in the trend. Pokmon Smile is a mobile app that hopes to help children develop good oral hygiene behavior using their child friendly IP. Using your mobile devices front facing camera, the app scans and judges the effectiveness of your brushing. The amount of time you can set to brush can be as low as a minute, or as long as three minutes. During this timeframe, the app will instruct you on where to brush and on screen your partner Pokmon will help clear the grime in the onscreen teeth. The app will tell you to brush better if it detects that youve slowed down or arent brushing vigorously enough. Once the brushing is done you have an opportunity to catch a Pokmon. Mine was still covered in a thick purple filmperhaps it was the apps way of telling me I didnt brush well enough and lo and behold, the creature broke loose after I threw my pokball at it. Saddened, I opted to cheer myself up by decorating one of the photos the app took during my brushing session. After the photo is done you can visit your hat gallery to view your collected hats, your pokdex to see your Pokmon (if I had any!). The app will reward consistency and rewards include stickers, frames, and new hats that will adorn the player as they brush. Anyone whod like to brute force their Pokmon collecting are out of luck as the app seems to impose a 4 hour cooldown period before you can brush again.I will reiterate, I am absolutely certain that a 39 year old is not the intended audience for this app. With that said, my qualms with the app is the order in which one brushes is kind of all over the place, perhaps this is to keep kids engaged, its hard to say. The app probably does not take into consideration those who utilize electric toothbrushes, so I found the brush I used (a Quipand no Im not sponsored) ended its run cycle earlier than the apps.", "date": "June 19, 2020", "grade": null}
