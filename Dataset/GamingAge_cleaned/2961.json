Super Strikers is a pretty simple one. It takes soccer, and gives it a turn-based twist. While Im not crazy about turn-based games, I see where its coming from. After all, if you think about it, football (the US version, not the one youre playing here) and baseball are turn-based games at their core, so its not a huge stretch to apply that to soccer too.(Admittedly, that ignores the fact that one of the great things about soccer is its free-flowing action. Breaking the game down so that each player can make a total of two limited moves per turn kind of flies in the face of how the sport works. But seeing as the EAs FIFA series has essentially cornered the market on the real thing, it makes sense that some enterprising developer might want to try something different.)Unfortunately, even if the idea mostly makes sense, the execution leaves something to be desired. Part of the problem is that each turn feels like a roll of the dice. For each of your moves  dribble, pass, shoot, tackle  you match your number up against those of your opponent, except there doesnt seem to be any strong connection between player ratings and the stats on any given move. You can be a powerful player trying to dribble around a weak defender, but that doesnt mean anything for any given turn. While that makes sense in real life sports, where good players can occasionally get trumped by lesser ones, it doesnt work as well in a game thats built around turn-based battles.The bigger issue with Ganbare! Super Strikers, though, is the difficulty curve here borders on the insane. The first match in story mode (which is where youll find the meat of the game) does a good job of easing you in and showing you the ropes, but as soon as you start your second match, the challenge ramps up significantly. Opposition players are suddenly equipped with all kinds of special moves like Ice Passes (which freezes your defenders), sleep tackles (which knock your players right out), and shots that cant be stopped. Needless to say, you lose that second game pretty handilyConsequently, you soon discover that you just have to keep on losing that second match again and again until your players have accumulated enough experience to finally eke out a victory. Want to earn all three stars from the match to unlock useful goodies like equipment? Thatll be some more grinding. Then you repeat it again for the third match, and the fourth match, and so on. Basically, if youre after an experience thats heavy on the grinding, Ganbare! Super Strikers offers just that.As a soccer game, though, its not nearly as enjoyable. Much like the real thing, the best thing about soccer video games is seeing the beautiful game in full flight. Ganbare! Super Strikers has a lot of the same elements of soccer (and some enhanced moves that, in the right circumstances, could have been kind of neat) but as a package, it gets bogged down in its twist. Turn-based battles arent inherently incompatible with soccer, but the two certainly dont mesh well here.", "date": "June 15, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
