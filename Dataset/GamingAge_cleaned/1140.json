You could probably get away with using that dreaded sports game epithet  roster update  and not be that far from the truth. Most of the changes from last year represent little more than tinkering to some degree or another, whether were talking about the inclusion of Facegen technology (which gives all the real players in this game pictures that vaguely approximate how they look in real life), an expanded historical database that includes more than 150,000 minor leaguers, or a Historic Exhibition option that allows you to pit any two teams from any point in baseball history against each other. All of these new features certainly add to the games already ridiculously high degree of realism, but considering how realistic the game already is, it feels like a textbook case of gilding the lily.If I have any complaint about OOTP 17, its a minor one: my favourite feature in last years game was the inclusion of weird little biographical stories about players that popped up in your inbox from time. Stories like a player being suspected of having an affair because of where his car had been spotted around town, or someone becoming a cult hero thanks to his commercials for a local used car dealership. They obviously had zero bearing on how a season plays out, but they still added a little off-kilter colour to a game that can otherwise be a little dry. They seem to be gone from OOTP 17, replaced by stories of players getting benched for being habitually late for practice or getting into shouting matches with local media. I may have been alone in loving those strange tales, but I still think they added something oddly wonderful to the game.As with the minor improvements, however, were talking about a nearly imperceptible decrease of enjoyment. Just as adding more minor leagues to the 1962 season only enhances OOTP 17 by a matter of degrees, so to does removing silly stories from the newswire only take away from it by a minimal amount.", "date": "April 21, 2016", "grade": "A-"}
