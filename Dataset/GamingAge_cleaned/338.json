Its one of those games that just kind of exists.There are, to be sure, worse things for a game to be. After all, it means that it doesnt contain any game-breaking bugs, nor does it do anything so badly that youll want to turn it off in frustration. Being competent is undeniably an achievement that many games could only dream of attaining.But it also means that Super Mutant Alien Assault doesnt do anything particularly new or exciting. It describes itself as an arcade platformer-shooter, which is really just a fancy way of saying that it borrows liberally from Super Crate Box and doesnt add all that much. You have a space theme instead ofhowever youd describe SCBs aesthetic, but beyond that, its all the same. Crates full of random weapons, lots of guns and explosions, and a steady stream of enemies coming after you. With only 12 levels, its a little short I suppose, but if the options are too short or too long, Ill take brevity every time.Besides, its not like I have a burning desire to have more Super Mutant Alien Assault. Its about as generic as they come, and its not like I wouldve preferred even more blandness on top of whats on offer here. If you have a Super Crate Box-shaped hole in your PS4 library, it might be worth thinking about this game, but otherwise, your life will be neither measurably better nor worse in any way whatsoever if you give this a try or not.", "date": "December 5, 2018", "grade": "C"}
