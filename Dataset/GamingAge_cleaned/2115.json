{"name": "Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/02/rocketbirds-hardboiled-chicken-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "In a lot of ways, Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken isnt all that different from countless games that have come before it. For one thing, its a side-scrolling platformer/shooter  in other words, the sort of game you couldve played on even some of the earliest consoles (though, obviously, Rocketbirds has substantially better graphics). Further, its plot revolves around a soldier out for some ultraviolent revenge  again, so far, so 80s, especially since the games hero sounds suspiciously Sylvester Stallone-esque.The key difference: youre playing as a chicken striving to overthrow his penguin oppressors. Im thinking thats not a theme thats been used by very many games. On its own, thats enough to make Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken stand out from all the other side-scrolling platformer/shooters that have come before it.Of course, to say thats the only difference between Rocketbirds and games like Contra or Metal Slug would be to do the game a disservice. Its got plenty of other things that make it unique beyond the simple fact that youre a chicken trying to shoot your way out of a penguin-dominated world  and these things go a long way towards making the game a worthwhile purchase.Take the excellent world-building, for example. Developers Ratloop didnt just come up with a wacky premise and call it day. Rather, they stuffed the game full of details that show they comitted to the idea. This, in turn, takes Rocketbirds into all kinds of fascinating places, like a natural history museum that shows penguins as the final stage of bird evolution, or intraspecies bird racism that prevents the non-penguins from banding together to overthrow their penguin oppressors.The writing is similarly fantastic. The dialogue falls somewhere between a loving homage to cheesy action flicks, and a witty send-up of the tropes those movies employ. Overall, it manages to be hilarious without being condescending or overly snarky towards its source material, and it makes the game more compelling because of it.There are, of course, a few flaws. The controls, most notably, are a little awkward and imprecise; when youre running and shooting (that is to say, the vast majority of the game) this isnt so bad, but try timing your jumps just so, or pushing a box from one place to another, and youll probably get a little frustrated by it. Additionally, the games use of the Vitas accelerometer leaves a little to be desired; as neat as it is to see the background shift when you tilt the handheld one way or another, it also means that if you want to see the action head-on, you have to keep your Vita stuck in one position.", "date": "February 28, 2013", "grade": "A"}
