Horror franchises have to find ever more inventive ways of killing off characters. Action movie setpieces have to get more and more grandiose and breathtaking. It doesnt matter what media were talking about  games, movies, books  sequels have to take things one step further, or they risk looking like pale imitations of the originals.Case in point: Criminal Girls 2: Party Favors. The first Criminal Girls wassomething. Not necessarily something good, mind you, but it was, if nothing else, memorable. How else to describe a dungeon crawler in which you were a prison guard tasked with leading a group of young, delinquent girls out of Hell, and then punishing them if they didnt get in line with your demands? It seemed designed to appeal to a very particular fetish niche, to the point that if you werent part of that niche, you probably wouldnt get much out of it beyond disgust.Truthfully, I was kind of terrified  albeit in a slow-down-for-a-car-crash kind of way  to see how Criminal Girls 2 would top its predecessor for sheer creepiness. I mean, what does a game do for an encore when its already gone to the well of using shocks and whips to get barely-pubescent girls to bend to your will?Not much else, as it turns out. I mean, sure, now you can also fling white goo at the girls (not to mention scrub and spank them), but all things considered, once youve established that youre okay with torturing (sorry, disciplining) young girls, changing the method can only shock and titillate so much. Not that its not a pretty horrific premise if you think about it for more than a few seconds, but it turns out that one game is all it takes to inure you to this kind of thing.Criminal Girls 2 does try to be transgressive in other ways, of course. The main characters uniform, for example, with its red armband and peaked cap, certainly has echoes of late-1930s Germany. And it practically goes without saying that every female character in the game is dressed in ways that wouldnt be out of place in an over-the-top burlesque show, and that theyre regularly arranged in ways that dont leave anything to the imagination.But as I said, none of that is as shocking as it was the first time around (or for anyone whos ever played pretty much any of the Vitas vast JRPG library), which means that, even more than in the original Criminal Girls, this game has to stand on its own merits. And unfortunately, theres not nearly enough here for it to do that.See, take away its lewd and lurid trappings, and youre left with a pretty rote dungeon-crawler. Turn-based combat is turn-based combat, regardless of how the girls taking those turns may be dressed. The same goes for exploring every nook and cranny of each floor: in moments like those, it doesnt matter if youre covered from head to toe or wearing strategically-placed strips of fabric, its still just lots of wandering.", "date": "October 31, 2016", "grade": "C-"}
