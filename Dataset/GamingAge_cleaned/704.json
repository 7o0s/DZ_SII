{"name": "Still Time", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/10/still-time-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Judging Still Time appropriately is something of a challenge.See, its a bad game, but its not a traditionally bad game. It doesnt try and pound you over the head with the same bad jokes, repeated over and over again. Its not out to make you spend as much money as possible. Its not a boring, grind-heavy slog. Its not even unplayably broken.That last one comes closest to describing whats wrong with Still Time, though. Think of it asplayably broken, I guess. The game features an intriguing core mechanic  the ability to manipulate time and create clones to help you solve a series of puzzles  that doesnt actually work 100% of the time. In fact, it doesnt even work, like, 75% of the time. It works roughly half the time, and there never seems to be any rhyme or reason as to when it will work, and when youll be left uselessly holding down the rewind button.This is a shame, because otherwise, Still Time shows a lot of promise. On top of the neat (albeit somewhat theoretical) mechanic, it features a fun story about time travel, coupled with some charming pixel art graphics. In another world  which is to say, one where the gameplays main draw wasnt a mess  itd be easy to see this game turning into a quirky indie hit.", "date": "October 19, 2017", "grade": "D+"}
