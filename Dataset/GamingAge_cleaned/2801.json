Its a game about making donuts. You have machines pumping out donuts, you have end points, and in between you have sprinkles and frosting and jelly and cherries andmy mouth is watering just thinking about it.Whats weird is that its not like were talking about realistic-looking donuts. With its pastel colours, I dont think anyone is likely to see the action here and feel like Freshly Frosted is some graphical powerhouse. As you can see from the screenshots, photorealism isnt a priority here.But at the same time, Freshly Frosted is warm and inviting, and knows how to suck you in. Its got a narrator who manages to sound bright and calming at the same time. Its soundtracked by synth-y electro-pop thats simultaneously soothing and cheery.And, most importantly, its got a whole bunch of puzzles that are hard enough to be challenging, but not so hard that the game is going to be unreasonably hard for most people. It certainly requires a bit of logic, but its not stingy with the hints if you need them, making it one of those puzzle games that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone.Plus, I mean, its about donuts. Its not too often a game will work your brain and whet your appetite, but Freshly Frosted manages to achieve that rare double feat.", "date": "February 13, 2023", "grade": "A"}
