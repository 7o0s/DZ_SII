{"name": "Titanfall 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/11/titanfall-2-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "I wasnt necessarily a fan of the first Titanfall, mostly because I didnt try jumping into the game until way after it released. When I played, I was absolutely outclassed by the online community, and couldnt muster the time or attention to try to improve. I appreciated the movement, the look of the Titan mechs, and the overall map design, but I had little fun with it.Thankfully, thats not the case with Titanfall 2. I point this out, because if youre strictly a PS4 player, youll likely be experiencing the series for the first time, and this game is absolutely fine as an entry point to the series. Better, in my opinion, because its a more fully formed game, with the addition of a remarkably good single-player campaign on top of the excellent selection of multiplayer modes.Seriously, the campaign is very good. Right up there with Doom as far as shooter campaigns of the year go. Thats not to say its similar to Doom, it isnt, but when it comes to overall quality, I think Doom is the only thing that surpasses it. A lot of that stems from the overall variety in what youll do during the campaign. And Im not just talking about wall-running and double-jumping. Theres a surprising amount of platforming going on here, with some mid-game mechanics introduced that are generally unexpected. Id even go so far as to liken some of those moments as very Portal-ish, which is certainly a good thing.The multiplayer in Titanfall 2 is no slouch either. Theres a decent number of modes, with Attrition returning amongst others. Theres some standard stuff here, like Capture the Flag, but for the most part the modes are pretty unique. Bounty Hunt, for instance, has you racking up a currency score with each successful kill/assist, but you need to bank that score before being killed or youll lose a percentage of it. This can only be done during limited moments at a handful of bank stations, which can make for a pretty harrowing experience.Coliseum is another MP mode, which you can only play if you have a ticket to enter. Yes, unfortunately, tickets are partially tied into promotions with various other companies, but you can (slowly) earn currency to buy tickets in-game as well. This is a best of 5, pilot vs. pilot, 1 vs.1 mode with rewards that provide skins and other custom items.And then of course theres the previously mentioned Attrition, returning from the original game. This mode features a series of A.I. controlled grunts in addition to two teams made up of actual players. Youll get 1 point per kill for the A.I. characters, and 5 per player kill. Its a neat simulated battle mode that Im glad to see included here, since it was certainly one of the more loved things about the original Titanfall.Visually I think Titanfall 2 looks solid, but isnt quite as remarkable as other releases this year. The actual design of the world, and Titans in particular, is great, but character faces look a little bland and less detailed overall. The environments, particularly the campaign levels, fair a little better in that regard, with some neat indoor industrial sections, one of which will likely be a stand-out moment for most that play the game.", "date": "November 2, 2016", "grade": "A"}
