Dont get me wrong, as a child of the 80s Im well aware of how much fun it can be to gather a couple of friends on the couch, but at the same timewell, we have online multiplayer now, and even if its not something I want all the time (or even most of it), its nice to have that option when you dont have anyone around to play a game with.I bring this up in the context of the cheekily-named Fluster Cluck because, obviously, its the latest PS4 game to be willfully ignorant of the wonders of the internet. Like Sportsfriends and Towerfall Ascension before it (along with Nidhogg, judging from the unfortunately empty online lobbies), its a multiplayer game that expects you to be at least a little bit popular, with a single-player mode thrown in almost as an afterthought.Now, Ill confess right now that I only played Fluster Cluck in single-player, which presumably means I missed out on playing the game as it was meant to be played. I didnt get to experience the joy of taunting my friends as I shot down their ships and turned them into chickens. I didnt get touhactually, that chicken thing is about it, come to think of it. Fluster Cluck isnt what youd call a deep game.Which means that even if I didnt play it as it was intended to be played, I think I still got a pretty good handle on the overall experience. And all I can say from that ismeh.Does meh sound too negative? Its not meant to be. Rather, think of it as a indifferent shoulder shrug. By no means is Fluster Cluck a great game, but its also not the second-worst PS4 game ever.Its definitely pretty shallow, though. It has a bunch of game modes, but theres not a huge amount of difference between them, since the core mechanic of shooting down your enemies and dragging them to the chicken-making holes never changes. Its also lacking in the graphics department, with all kinds of garish colors and an overall aesthetic that seems like its left over from the 90s. And strategy? Dont even think about it  it doesnt take long to realize that all the action centres around those chicken-making holes, which means that the game quickly devolves into all four spaceships flying in circles shooting around each other, with the winner being whoever is able to spam the shooting buttons the most.", "date": "October 28, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
