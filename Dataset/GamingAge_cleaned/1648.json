Its flaws will be readily apparent to anyone who plays it for more than a few minutes. And yetits definitely in the running for being my own personal GOTY.First, though, the flaws. Most obviously, the load times are insanely long. Like, long enough that every time I started a level, Id get out my phone and start surfing the internet. Long enough that my screen would occasionally dim thanks to my PS Vitas power-saving settings. Long enough thatwell, you get the picture. Bottom line, Counterspys got long load times.On top of that, its also pretty short. Thats not inherently the worst thing in the world, of course. Indeed, if youre like me and youve got a massive backlog and not nearly enough time to play everything, that might even be welcome. Plus, the way the game is set up  with lots of short, bite-sized levels  makes it conducive to on-the-go gaming. Still, Counterspys the sort of game youll be able to beat the game in a couple of hours, and Im sure there are people for whom that will be a problem.Not me, though. As I said, this is easily one of the most enjoyable games Ive played this year. The gameplay is fun, a perfect mix of platforming and stealth that rewards having an adaptable play style (and has just enough explosive objects laying around for no good reason other than to launch unsuspecting enemies into the ceiling). The graphics are stylish, a wonderful mix of Soviet-era iconography and Team Fortress, with a dose of Pixar thrown in for good measure. The music is equally retro-tinged, capturing feel of a 60s spy comedy. Even the writing is top-notch; while theres minimal dialogue here, whats included is always fun, and thats without even going into the little flourishes like the names of top secret documents that are scattered throughout the levels (not to mention the little tidbits of Cold War trivia the game helpfully doles out during those interminable load screens).", "date": "September 4, 2014", "grade": "A"}
