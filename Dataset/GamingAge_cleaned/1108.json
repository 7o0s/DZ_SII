{"name": "Dreii", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/06/dreii-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "I fell in love with Dreii from the very first moment I started playing it.This is probably an odder admission than it should be, in more ways than one. First off  at least from my perspective  it doesnt seem like it should be an easy game to love. Dreiis graphics are sparse, its gameplay minimalistic, and its soundtrack off-kilter and dissonant. If anything, it almost seems designed to be as off-putting as possible to new players, as if it wants you to have to take some time before you can become accustomed to its off-key rhythms.As I said, though, in my case, it was love at first sight. The soundtrack may be a little atonal, but I loved it anyway  something about the random squawks and squeaks just made it seem more heartfelt, in my ears. Likewise, while the graphics may consist primarily of shapes on top of solid pastel backgrounds, I thought it popped off the Vitas screen, with the added bonus of the relative lack of clutter being well-suited to the smaller screen size. Most importantly, the gameplay  which consists of balancing those aforementioned shapes on top of each other in order to reach specific dots on the screen  is an ideal match for gaming on the go, with short levels and a control scheme that makes use of the Vitas combination of touch and button controls.None of those things, admittedly, are that odd. While I cant imagine a world in which Dreii became a mainstream hit, Im not going to pretend that its so quirky or idiosyncratic that I cant imagine anyone else liking it.What I do doubt, however, is that anyone else who loves Dreii played it as incorrectly as I did.See, at its heart, Dreii is a multiplayer game. Youre supposed to solve its puzzles with other players, but without the benefit of verbal communication. In this respect, its a little reminiscent of Ibb and Obb, that odd little PS3/PC platformer from a few years ago whose big hook was that you had to wordlessly collaborate with other players.I somehow didnt know this at all. I played it entirely solo, solving the puzzles all by my lonesome. Occasionally I found the odd level to be a little challenging, but it was never so hard that I felt like it was impossible. I only learned Dreii was supposed to be played with other people when I sat down to write this review  which, I admit, is a major oversight on my part.", "date": "June 1, 2016", "grade": "A"}
