{"name": "Ys Origin", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/03/ys-origin-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Ive long had a soft spot for the Ys series. Going back to Ys Seven on the PSP  about a decade ago  Ive always found time to sink a fair amount of hours into each new game in the series, and that includes Ys Origin when it was rereleased on the Vita about four years ago.In other words, I went into Ys Origin on the Switch pretty much knowing I would like it. While the game departs a little from the usual Ys formula  more on that in a moment  its still exactly what youd expect from a modern Ys game, and, consequently, it cant help but be a solid action RPG.As I said, though, it is a little different. Rather than fighting through wild lands with Adol and Dogi, Ys Origin takes place hundreds of years before the first game in the series  which means, of course, no Adol and Dogi. It takes a little getting used to the new characters here, especially since one of them is a mage rather than a warrior, but eventually the game settles into a solid rhythm.If youre going to nitpick, you might even say that the game settles into too much of a rhythm. One of the joys of modern Ys games is that the maps seem genuinely huge. In Ys Origin, by contrast, it sometimes feels like youre fighting in dungeon after dungeon, without any real variety to break it up. I mean, its a dungeon-crawler, so thats kind of the point, but it still feels a little same-y in places.Still, even without some of the series usual trappings, Ys Origin cant help but be fun. It may be a slightly different take on what the Ys series has offered in recent years, but for fans of the series, its well worth checking out.", "date": "March 5, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
