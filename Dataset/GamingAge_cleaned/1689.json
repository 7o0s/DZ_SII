{"name": "Sacra Terra: Kiss of Death", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/07/sacra-terra-kiss-death-review-ps3/", "text": "I feel a little ashamed to admit this in civilized company, but Im starting to consider myself something of a connoisseur of Alawars PS3 hidden object games. Mountain Crime: Requital? Fun, if a little overambitious. Twisted Lands: Shadow Town? Still fun, if a little nonsensical. And their release before Sacra Terra: Kiss of Death, Forest Legends: The Call of Love? A horrible case study in what happens when you remove hidden objects from a hidden object game.(Side note: Boy, do Alawar ever have a thing for titles with colons in them.)Which brings me to the aforementioned Sacra Terra. Its good. Great, even, if were comparing it to Forest Legends, since, again, a hidden object game without hidden objects isnt much of anything. In fact, not only does it have hidden objects to find, it also improves on that last game by featuring puzzles that are actually moderately difficult to solve. I know this is a low bar to clear, but its all worth mentioning, at the very least.In other words, Sacra Terra is good in a relative sense. But is it good on any kind of absolute level? Thats a slightly harder question to answer. See, its still a hidden object game, and by their nature, those are seldom very good or very bad. If youre going into it hoping for a mind-blowing experience, youll definitely feel a bit let down.If, on the other hand, you just want a decent adventure game, then it should do the trick. The puzzles  hidden object and otherwise  are just challenging enough to be fun, but not so hard you end up spamming the hint buttons. Equally importantly, its got a fairly (well, relatively) easy-to-follow story: youre trying to rescue your boyfriend (take that, trope!) from the clutches of an evil demon, and to do that you need to go through some portals to the past to help other lovers solve their problems. Its not exactly Shakespeare, but considering how convoluted the plots have been in other Alawar games to date, the straightforwardness on display here is refreshing. Likewise, the graphics are significantly better; Alawar still have significant problems when it comes to making faces that dont look like abominations, but otherwise the game is surprisingly nice to look at.(Though speaking of abominable, it should be noted that Sacra Terra features the worst voice acting ever. Just freakishly awful in every respect.)", "date": "July 22, 2014", "grade": "B"}
