{"name": "Alien Shooter", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/06/alien-shooter-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Not too long ago, I was raving about how far 8floor had come in terms of developing games for the Vita. Theyd limited themselves to casual games, sure, but over the course of about a year theyd gone from releasing very poorly made mobile ports to ones that looked and played really well. Consequently, I was excited  albeit in a small, low stakes kind of way  for Alien Shooter, since it represented their first Vita game geared towards a more hardcore gaming audience.I probably shouldve tempered my expectations. While Alien Shooter isnt anywhere close to being as bad as their earlier efforts, its still not really worth checking out unless youve got a desperate need to play a mediocre twin stick shooter.In fact, even then, youd better really want one of those, because you its hard to see what youd get here that you couldnt also get out of replaying Age of Zombies or Ultratron or Pixeljunk Shooter a few more times. Its not that Alien Shooter is bad, either  its just that its so profoundly uninspired. As the title implies, its a game where you shoot aliens andwell, thats it. Just mowing down dozens upon dozens of aliens, until the metal ground under your feet is slick with bits and pieces of them.If that description makes the game sound cool, it really shouldnt, since the reality of Alien Shooter is much, much more bland. The environments are interchangeable, all ugly, metallic labs with zero personality. The aliens are equally forgettable, looking for the most part like mutated crickets  occasionally you get them in different colors, but thats about as inventive as the character designs get.It should come as no surprise that the gameplay is about as rote as you could imagine, too. Just think of a no-frills twin stick shooter, and you now know everything there is to know about Alien Shooter. The weapons are boring, the goals are straightforward, and at no time will you run any risk of being surprised. The only thing different about the game is that it doesnt include a minimap  and considering that a) you need to clear every room before moving on, and b) the levels become pretty big pretty quickly, thats hardly a point in its favor.", "date": "June 9, 2015", "grade": "C+"}
