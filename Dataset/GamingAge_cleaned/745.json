{"name": "Hell Pie", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/09/hell-pie-review-for-xbox-playstation-switch-pc/", "text": "I have no doubt that Hell Pie will be some peoples new favourite game. Of course, by some people, I mean people who love gross-out gags and lots of gore  because those are two things that this game has in abundance. I mean, just pick anything in this game at random, and youll either be in love with it or be grossed out and/or offended. You upgrade your abilities by tearing horns out of sheeps heads. You attack enemies by swinging a morbidly obese naked angel-baby at them. You bounce off the entrails of dead demons and humans, as flies buzz around the gore. You fight off Nazi pieces of poop (named the Shit Staffel), whose home is filled with used toilet paper and the dismembered and exploded remains of their foes. Theres an insane amount of vomit and blood and genitals.I suspect its all very thrilling if youre a 14-year-old edgelord.If youre not, the good news is that Hell Pie is still a decent enough 3D platformer. The star of the game, Nate (a demon, obviously) zips around this obscene world with a surprising amount of gracefulness, using double-jumps and flips and rockets to soar from platform to platform. There are a couple of worlds here to explore, and plenty of objects to collect  which makes sense, since youre on a mission to gather ingredients for Satans birthday cake. Mind you, that last bit is a reason why you might not enjoy the game even if youre okay with the puerile humour. Hell Pie is a throwback to the platformers from a few decades ago, which means at time it feels like a pointless collect-a-thon, as youre gathering random objects just for the sake of having them all. If youre a completionist, it might get a little overwhelming.Then again, if you can stomach all the gross-out gags, finding a few extra random objects shouldnt throw you off too much. Hell Pie clearly isnt for everybody, but if youre the sort of person who loves pushing boundaries  and your definition of boundaries havent changed much since you were in high school  then it might just be the game for you.", "date": "September 16, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
