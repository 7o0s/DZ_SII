{"name": "Hob: The Definitive Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/09/hob-the-definitive-edition-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4/", "text": "As I wrote recently, I have a strange preference when it comes to Zelda and Zelda-like games. Ive never been able to get into any Zelda  be they the original games on the NES, all the way through to Breath of the Wild. Give me a Zelda-ish game, however  say, Oceanhorn, or Yonder  and I cant get enough of it.While I wouldnt say that Hob is a direct copy of anything from the Hyrule universe, its certainly close enough enough that some comparisons are inevitable. And, unsurprisingly, I love it.Mind you, I wouldnt say that I love it because of how much it reminds me of those other games I like. Rather, I love it because of how well it works. Its a game built around exploring a mysterious world, and even though it makes no attempt to explain anything to you (seriously, the map is both huge and kind of useless), it makes exploring a breeze. Your character moves around the world with ease, and whether youre walking, running, or jumping, you always feel in control of what theyre doing. Likewise, combat works well, with both a sword and some kind of power-punch at your disposal.Its also worth noting that the game works phenomenally well on the Switch. Whatever performance problems may have plagued it on the PS4, none of those are present here. It simply runs smoothly, without any noticeable issues.I should probably also add that simply calling Hob a straight-up Zelda clone does it a grave disservice  its clearly more than that. The better description, perhaps, might be The Legend of Zelda filtered through Diablo (or Torchlight, if you want to reference it to one of the developers previous games), with its quasi-isometric view and its slightly more linear approach to action.However you want to describe it, though, theres no denying Hob is great. Its an action-adventure game that has an abundance of both of those things, and if you want some Zelda-adjacent action on your Switch, youll find plenty to love here.", "date": "September 20, 2019", "grade": "A"}
