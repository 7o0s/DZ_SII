{"name": "Race The Sun", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/11/race-sun-review-ps-vita-ps4-ps3/", "text": "Some ideas are so simple and obvious, its hard to believe that no one has had them before. Take, for instance, Race The Sun. Its essentially an endless runner with a futuristic sheen, and thats it. Not many bells or whistles; basically, imagine Raymans Jungle Run or Temple Run with an F-Zero makeover, and you have the essence of the game. Its the kind of thing that sounds like it should have already been done to death.As far as I know, though, its hasnt been. Or, at the very least, it hasnt been done to death on PlayStation platforms, which is where I do the bulk of my gaming. And now that it is here, Im wondering where its been all my life.Now, before I get too hyperbolic about Race The Sun, Ill admit that the game isnt essential by any means. It is, after all, an endless runner, and no amount of sleek spaceships or geometric cityscapes will change that. When you get down to it, its still just a game to whip out when you have a couple of minutes to kill.But you know what? For those few minutes at a time, its pretty close to perfect. The gameplay is fast and simple, the sort of thing thats really easy to pick up, but incredibly hard to master. You just swerve from side to side, dodging objects that come at an increasingly fast and frantic pace, trying to keep your solar-powered battery charged by the ever-setting sun. There are power-ups to be acquired and achievements to, er, achieve, but really, those are secondary to the games core mechanic of getting as far as you possibly can until you slam into a wall and explode. (And, of course, Race The Sun does also have those achievements and power-ups, along with high score leaderboards, so if replayability is your big concern, it shouldnt be.)", "date": "November 3, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
