{"name": "New Super Mario Bros. 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/08/new-super-mario-bros-2-review-for-3ds/", "text": "New Super Mario Bros. 2 feels like a case of Nintendo playing it safe with their core franchise, which does lead to the overall experience being a little bit disappointing. Im not going to waste your time explaining what the game is about, as it follows the typical structure of Peach being kidnapped, and the brothers going to save her. It does feature the Koopa Kids once again, which I certainly appreciate more than Bowser Jr., but if youve played a Super Mario title before, youll have a pretty good idea of what to expect here.The most disappointing aspect of New Super Mario Bros. 2 is that its remarkably easy, and doesnt really elevate the series past what New Super Mario Bros. Wii managed to do. The original DS title that kickstarted this line of Super Mario games was pretty solid, and was certainly a breath of fresh air considering we hadnt seen a new 2D Mario adventure in quite a while. Say what you will about the art style and music, as I know that those two things dont seem to appeal to everyone, the core gameplay and level design was still a lot of fun and fairly fresh.New Super Mario Bros. Wii ratcheted that up another level, featuring more worlds, four player co-op, and some actual difficulty to boot. Granted, it didnt get tougher until the later stages, but if you factored in the optional secret world, NSMB Wii could really give you a run for your money.And in that regard NSMB 2 feels like a step backwards. The concept of revolving around coin collecting is certainly a fun idea, and I appreciate that the developers tried to do something with that here. But I feel like it fell a little short in concept, and instead just piles on the extra lives with no other real incentive for collecting coins. As you might have heard by now, the reward for collecting one million coins isnt all that, so outside of challenging yourself with high score runs, the focus on coin collecting does little more than make an already easy game that much easier. I had really hoped that there would be more to unlock, giving me more of a reason to collect all these coins, but that doesnt seem to be the case so far unless something is introduced down the line via DLC.But even though the game is remarkably easy, that doesnt mean that its not a lot of fun. While the challenge might be gone, the core gameplay that makes most of Marios 2D adventures so much fun is still present. Theres enough enemy variety, clever level layout, and fun boss fights to keep most fans entertained. And while the core map of six worlds might seem a little light on content, there are a few others that youll be able to seek out if you look hard enough. And then theres the three big coins hidden throughout each level, like the NSMB predecessors had, and locating these can be a bit of a hunt. Theyre generally not hard to reach, but can be a little tough to find, usually prompting you to do multiple runs through a single stage, offering up a little replay value for the game.Besides the main game, NSMB 2 introduces a new mode dubbed Coin Rush. Coin Rush is really where youll find some semblance of challenge, as it features a single life run through three randomly picked stages culled from different levels. There are different packs featured here, meaning that one pack will pull levels from Worlds 1 and 2, while another pulls from 3 and 4, and so on. Not only are you limited to a single life on these runs, but the time limit for each stage is also generally restricted to 100 seconds. I had a whole lot of fun with this mode, and its really the biggest reason to pick up and play the game once youre finished with the final boss fight.", "date": "August 15, 2012", "grade": "B"}
