{"name": "Resident Evil Revelations 2: Penal Colony Impressions", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/02/resident-evil-revelations-2-penal-colony-impressions/", "text": "The first episode in Capcoms Resident Evil Revelations 2 launches this week, dubbed Penal Colony, for PSN and Xbox Live. Ive been provided with codes for this episode, and future episodes (along with the two bonus episodes). The publisher is suggesting that scored reviews be held for the final, combined product, while encouraging impressions of the weekly episodes as they release, which is what youll see below. Im OK with this, since we have access to the whole thing, and playing past episode 1 will clearly influence my opinion of that chapter in a way that I cant describe until the later installments release. So check out my thoughts on Episode 1 Penal Colony below, and come back the same time next week (and every week thereafter) to see how things progress for Resident Evil Revelations 2.While I remember enjoying Resident Evil Revelations when I originally played it on the 3DS, Ill freely admit that I cant remember a damn thing about the story. I recall the setting, and characters involved, but I found myself drawing a complete blank when recalling the previous events in this spin-off series. That said, nothing in the first episode of the sequel to Revelations makes that seem important, at least not in a way that immediately stands out.At the onset of this episode, Penal Colony, we are reintroduced to Claire Redfield of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Code Veronica fame. Its been a while since weve seen Claire in action, and if youre expecting to catch up on where Claire has been, prepare to be disappointed. Instead were introduced to Claire as some sort of boss/manager of a company called Terra Save, which appears to deal with biological terror clean-ups, explained through an overly cheesy commercial at the onset of Claires chapter. Were also introduced to her partner character for this section, the daughter of Resident Evil 1s Barry Burton, Moira Burton.Things quickly go south for Claire and Moira, who are both kidnapped, and then awaken to find themselves the sole inhabitants of a run-down prison in an undisclosed location. Youll immediately take control of Claire, with Moira joining shortly thereafter. Thats right, Resident Evil Revelations 2 incorporates a partner system similar to Resident Evil 5. The biggest difference here is that your partner in both Claire and Barrys chapters takes on a sort of support role, as opposed to being an active combatant. For instance, Moira controls a flashlight, helpfully pointing out hidden objects. She also wields a crowbar, useful for opening certain doors and stunning enemies. Finally, Moira can also pick locks, used for unlocking crates that contain various goods.Partner A.I. seems competent enough, especially so when it comes to avoiding hazards. Youll have a helpful pop-up displayed onscreen that lets you know where your partner is at any given moment, and the amount of time spent apart is minimal at best. Youll gain the ability to switch between the two on the fly early in this chapter, but its rarely necessary to do so until you meet the aforementioned locked crate or barred door.Combat feels similar to modern day Resident Evil titles, in that its still pretty focused on action mechanics and shooting as opposed to ammo conservation and avoidance. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, but for anyone hoping that this is more Resident Evil 1 through 3 and less 4 through 6, then Revelations 2 isnt what youre looking for. Its a tad disappointing, because there were aspects of the original Revelations that felt closer in tone to RE1 than anything in the series has for the past decade, but nothing about this first chapter of Revelations 2 gives off that same vibe.Still, there are some very Resident Evil-y things about Penal Colony. At a certain point in Claires chapter the prison opens up a bit, giving you multiple paths, doors, and enemies to contend with. The enemy variety here is mostly zombie type foes, with some alterations for Barrys section of the story, and some lumbering, tougher monsters that Claire has to contend with. Again, ammo conservation isnt really a thing, but you dont want to just spray and pray either. The weapon selection at the onset of the game is right out of the Resident Evil handbook, with Claire sporting a shotgun and pistol, while Barry has the pistol, magnum, and assault rifle.Theres some light puzzle solving, which equates to turning on power switches, hunting down one object thats pointed out immediately by your A.I. controlled partner (despite being easily visible), and a somewhat harrowing finale on Claires end thats reminiscent of older Resident Evil titles. Basically, while there are things here that feel like a Resident Evil game, theyre presented in a way thats likely meant to be accessible, but done in a way thats going to disappoint longtime fans. Its unfortunate that Capcom cant strike a better balance than what Episode 1 manages to do in that regard.Also disappointing are the two major areas that Claire and Barry get to play around in. The prison area is the better of the two, which Claire spends most of her time in. But even the prison has some wasted designs, with non-interactive doors that serve as window dressing, a strangely haphazard layout, and waypoints that make exploration mostly pointless. But this doesnt hold a candle to how poorly designed Barrys outdoor section is, especially the darkly wooded area that you just sort of wander through for 10 minutes, and the subsequent lumber mill with its handful of monstrosities to contend with.", "date": "February 24, 2015", "grade": null}
