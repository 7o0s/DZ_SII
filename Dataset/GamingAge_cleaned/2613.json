{"name": "Scarlet Nexus", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/07/scarlet-nexus-review-for-xbox-series-x-ps5-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "I have zero interest in anime. Even though Ive played an absurd number of visual novels and other quirky Japanese games for this site, that hasnt translated into me ever seeking out or watching any Japanese cartoons.Im mentioning that right off the bat because its relevant to Scarlet Nexus in a couple of ways. First, this is a very anime-heavy game. Yes, theres action  and Ill get to that in a moment  but for every bit of monster-fighting you do in this game, youll spend just as much time watching lengthy cutscenes. Given my aforementioned lack of interest in anime, you might think that this meant I hated the game  or, at the very least, found it impossible to get into.Now, Im not going to lie: I lost interest in those cutscenes very, very quickly. As soon as I realized it was your standard teens join some weird version of the military, have to save the world trope, everything went in one ear and out the other, and I didnt retain a single moment of it.But heres the thing (and this would be the second key point related to me not caring about anime): I still loved Scarlet Nexus. Even if I couldnt tell you a single characters name, it was still incredibly easy to get engrossed in this game thanks to the fantastic combat. Those militarized teens also happen to have extra-sensory powers, which is a fancy way of saying they can move stuff with their mind  and, in combat, use those powers to pick up items from your environment and hurl them at your enemies.Let me tell you: theres something insanely satisfying about picking up a truck and smacking a monster in the face with it. Like, if the battles were just your standard hack and slash fights, the game would be okay, but adding in psychokinesis  not to mention being able to mind meld with your teammates and send them on the attack  raises Scarlet Nexus to a whole other level.Obviously, your enjoyment of Scarlet Nexus will likely be greater if you actually do enjoy anime (or maybe not  or all I know, this games story may be horrifically bad!). But if youre indifferent to the genre, you shouldnt let that stop you from enjoying a very fun action game.", "date": "July 2, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
