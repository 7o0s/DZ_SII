{"name": "Fable Heroes", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/05/fable-heroes-review-for-xbla/", "text": "Fable Heroes isnt quite your standard Fable adventure, and bears a more striking resemblance to old-school Konami arcade beat em ups like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, X-Men, or The Simpsons. That said, its also not quite as enjoyable as any of the above mentioned games, but its not entirely devoid of some charm.The art style of Fable Heroes adopts a puppet look to the various heroes youll get to control, which are all taken from the Fable series and should be instantly recognizable to fans. I actually really liked the design of the characters that you control, but thought it odd that the look didnt carry over to the enemies featured in the game. The enemies, along with the stages, are also cribbed from the Fable universe, but are really just miniature representations of the foes youd face in Fable 1, 2, and 3.Fable Heroes is a multiplayer focused adventure, featuring up to four players with drop-in and drop-out online or local multiplayer. The premise is simple enough, guide your selected hero through a series of stages and whack your sword against everything else that moves. As you do so, enemies will literally explode into a shower of coins, which can then be spent on character upgrades. There are a lot of characters to choose from, and a few more which are locked away until the release of Fable: The Journey, so if youre at all interested in maxing out the entire roster, it might take you a while to do so.The character upgrade system is a little odd though, and not really to my liking. Instead of just giving you a list of skills to purchase with your gold, at the end of every level youll be presented with a game board and will be able to roll a certain number of six-sided die based on your performance in the stage that was just finished. Each space on the board represents about three different upgrades, like increased damage against certain enemies, additional emotes for your character faces, a different style of weapon, percentage increases to gold gained, and so on. This system becomes troublesome as you advance though, because eventually youll get stuck wasting dice rolls landing on spaces where youve already acquired all abilities available. This means when youre down to the last five or six slots to fill, youll often need to replay stages again and again in the hopes of getting lucky enough to land on the scant few spaces you need.And since I didnt find the combat or stages particularly satisfying, it really starts to feel like a grind-fest pretty quick. Combat is little more than mashing the hell out of the X button, and occasionally tapping Y for a flourish attack which seems to do little more than have a long wind-up time associated with it. Theres not much of a satisfying impact effect when striking enemies, and the screen often gets so busy with different effects, creatures, and gold flying around that its actually easy to lose track of where your character even is. Combat also fails to be challenging on the normal difficulty setting, but bumping up the difficulty just prolongs the already lengthy stages and further emphasizes the lack of abilities these characters have. Theres even little to differentiate one character from another other than the fact that some are focused on ranged attacks while others are for melee.", "date": "May 10, 2012", "grade": "C-"}
