{"name": "Pokemon Conquest", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/07/pokemon-conquest-review-for-nintendo-ds/", "text": "Im not sure who had the idea to toss together Tecmo Koeis Nobunagas Ambition in with Pokmon, but its actually made for a surprisingly good fit. When it was announced I literally had no idea how this would work out, but having played through the game now Im happy to say that it makes for a really entertaining SRPG that manages to make use of both licenses quite well.As the game begins youre tasked with command over a single kingdom in the Ransei Region, set in a similar time period to classic Nobunaga Ambition titles. Pokmon are apparently abundant here, and theres a legend that says if all the kingdoms in Ransei are united, the legendary Pokmon that created Ransei will appear. Thats the driving ambition for the cast of the game, which sees you battling it out against opposing nations, taking them over, and then using their Pokmon and resident Warlords as your own. If you take a step back and really think about the concept, its actually kind of jacked up in a war mongering sort of way for any kid-themed Pokmon title, but it never gets to be overtly serious or tries to explore any moral quandaries associated with the concept, so youre better off not giving it a whole lot of thought.The first four kingdoms youll take over work a bit like an extended introduction to the game, and at the onset Pokmon Conquest tends to hold your hand a little too long, which is a common issue with a lot of modern games, and more so for games that are meant to be kid friendly. If youve ever played any kind of strategy RPG before, like Final Fantasy Tactics or more appropriately Nobunagas Ambition itself, youll pick up on what to do in Pokmon Conquest after about 15 minutes of play. So the fact that youre stuck with training wheels for about an hour and a half is kind of a bummer, and makes for a slow burn.But once you start getting into the swing of things with conquering neighboring countries, Pokmon Conquest starts to step things up a bit. It never gets to be incredibly difficult, and if youre having any trouble with beating a particular Warlord you can grind your way to victory by trying to max out your links with Pokmon, but its not so much the challenge that keeps you coming back for more. Instead, its the smart use of Pokmons rock/paper/scissors style of gameplay mixed in with the battlefields of strategy RPGs, along with the random encounters thatll grant you exceptionally rare Pokmon to check out and try. Theres a feeling of just one more battle that youll find yourself needing to participate in right when you think youre ready to put down the DS, and it becomes a pretty addictive experience quickly.As you expand past the four initial kingdoms, youll gain additional functions to make use of throughout the game. One of these involves assigning recruited Warlords tasks to perform in between stages, which can involve improving resident Pokmon, recruiting more Warlords for your cause, or searching for gold which can then be used to buy various items.Youll also need to think about whom you station where and why, as you can come under attack by neighboring countries on occasion, and being caught unawares can lead to you losing a location or two. This is less of an issue throughout the initial campaign, but optional end-game content makes better use of this possibility and at times it can feel like an intense game of cat and mouse with a few rambunctious neighbors.Along with this, youll also gain the ability to recruit and add wild Pokmon that arent attached to un-recruited Warlords. You characters can all have control of a number of Pokmon at a time, and making an eclectic mix for some of the late-game fights youll get into is definitely a good idea. And since youll surely want to level up, and evolve those Pokmon, be prepared to spend a fair amount of time with the game if youre at all interested in seeing everything the game has to offer.The core campaign can be kind of short if you just blaze through the content, but theres so much end-game and post-game stuff to see that youll find a surprising amount of stuff past just the initial campaign. So while this might not have the legs that a typical Pokmon RPG from Nintendo tends to have, its still pretty robust.Visually the game isnt what Id call outstanding, and Id definitely say that something like Pokmon Black and White, or their upcoming sequels, has a better overall design and look to it than conquest. Im not a huge fan of the animations in conquest, and art style is a little too generic for me to really enjoy. The stage designs that youll fight in do get a little inventive though, especially when invading a new location, so thats nice to see.", "date": "July 3, 2012", "grade": "A-"}
