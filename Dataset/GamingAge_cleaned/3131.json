{"name": "One Night Stand", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/12/one-night-stand-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "As someone who was never big on partying, drinking, or casual relationships, One Night Stand doesnt exactly speak to me on a personal experience level. After all, its a game thats about a man and a woman chatting in her bedroom following, as the games title implies, a one night stand. Playing from the mans point of view, your recollection of the previous night is hazy, so its up to you to decide how honest you want to be, and where you want the conversation to go.As I said, literally no part of that resonates with anything from my own life. But, much like I can enjoy Arkham games despite never being a playboy billionaire vigilante, or I can play the heck out of the MLB The Show series despite being mostly lacking in athletic ability, Im able to appreciate One Night Stand because of the way it treats its characters, its story, and its entire approach. Its thoughtful, and engaging, and mature, all in ways that very, very few other games are, even in this post-games-as-art age.Its hard to talk about what exactly happens in One Night Stand, since there are a dozen different endings, and I dont want to give away any of them. I will say, though, that as much as this is a game that rewards you for being inquisitive and pleasant, conversations can take all kinds of strange and awkward turns, so it demands that you play through it several times in order to get the full experience.To some extent, this means that youll probably get a little tired of seeing some of the same scenes over and over again. While there are quite a few ways for the game to end, youll end up seeing many of the games component scenes several times along the way. Thankfully, One Night Stands developers were nice enough to include a fast-forward button, which means that you can always zip through dialogue sections youve seen one or twice (or seven or eight or nine) times before. You can also make a few timely saves, which allows you to double-back after some challenging decisions and see how else your morning could play out.What really makes One Night Stand worthwhile, though, is that despite its name  and the fact you find yourself in bed with a naked woman right off the bat  its not interested in being sexy (or, seeing as its a game, sexy) or titillating. Its just a short, somewhat awkward, occasionally charming and funny (depending on what choices you pick) game about a pair of twenty-somethings having a mature conversation. There really isnt anything else like it, and its worth checking out if youre in the mood for a game about talking.", "date": "December 4, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
