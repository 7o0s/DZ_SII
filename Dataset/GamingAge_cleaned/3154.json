{"name": "Into the Dead 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/11/into-the-dead-2-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Whatever else there is to say about Into the Dead 2, this seems like it should come first:I know, I know: the Switch version doesnt include in-app purchases, some of which run as high as $70 on mobile. But even if the mobile version has more than a hint of pay-to-win about it, it doesnt erase the fact that youre still paying $35 just for buttons. Even as someone who likes buttons, that seems almost indefensible.It also doesnt help that even with the in-app purchases taken out of Into the Dead 2, theres still a giant, IAP-shaped hole where they used to be. The game is geared towards separating players from their money at every opportunity, and it does so by doling out XP at the most miserly rate imaginable. In the mobile game, your options are to either tough it out and grind your way through level after level, over and over again, very slowly earning the XP you need to upgrade your guns  or, alternatively, you could buy gold, and take a shortcut.The Switch version doesnt have the shortcut, as far as I can tell, but it still only gives you tiny amounts of XP for every level you finish. You get useless, single-use power-ups. Your scant amounts of ammo carry over from level to level, including if you restart a level. The only way here to get marginally better guns is to do the same thing overand overand over.And make no mistake, Into the Dead 2 is already a game thats built around repetition. Its an auto-runner where your goal is to run a certain distance, avoiding and/or obliterating zombies all the way. Theres some story that tries to tie it all together about saving your loved ones, but thats beside the point: every level is all about getting from point A to point B, ideally shooting enough zombies to get an extra star, with the rare detour into very short turret gun sections. Doing these levels one after the other after the other will make you feel like youre playing the same level on repeat; literally doing the same level over and over again, and then doing the next one over and over again, and so on and so forth just to upgrade a few guns just feels torturous.The odd thing is, if you just ignore what the game is trying to make you do and just have fun with it, Into the Dead 2 becomes passably decent, at least for a little while. If you simply focus on running, rather than on shooting, youll find that the game conveys that feeling of momentum, of striving towards those endpoints, surprisingly well. You almost feel like youre moving forward, and it feels kind of cool. Eventually, of course, youll reach a point where you need more firepower and youll just have to go back and do those levels over again until youve marginally improved the options at your disposal, but if only for a few moments, the game isnt all bad.", "date": "November 14, 2019", "grade": "C-"}
