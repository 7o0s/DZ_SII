(Side note: I seriously cant believe its been ten years since I first played this game.) Id be hard-pressed to give you any specifics, but I definitely remember racing around the fictional Seacrest County, slamming cars off the road as both a street racer and a cop, and generally enjoying all the crazy vehicular carnage.Now that Ive returned to the game via Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered, however, I may need to revisit my opinion of it a little.Dont get me wrong, its still fun. Whether youre a cop chasing down street racers, or a street racer shunting cop cars off the road, theres something immensely satisfying about the way everything slows down, you feel the crunch of metal, and you watch as the victimized cars slowly flip through the air. Add in the EMPs and the blockades and whatnot that you get when you play as the police, and you have a recipe for a great vehicular combat game (albeit one that, given the political narrative around use of force and massive police budgets, seems like itd be much more controversial if it first came out today).What Id forgotten, however, is just how much of NFS Hot Pursuit is spent not crashing cars. The game features way more levels that are either time trials or straight-up racers than I couldve possibly imagined, and even if theyre entirely what youd expect from a Need for Speed street racing level  which is to say, plenty of winding highways and gorgeous scenery  they dont feel that different from most of the other games in the series in recent years. On top of that, even within the levels that are theoretically built around crashing your opponents, theres much less of it than I remember. The roads are mostly pretty empty, the cars that arent meant to be crashed are surprisingly robust, and because you have so few opponents on the road, youve got to focus more on the quality of the few crashes you get, rather than the quantity. And even if the quality is great, the quantity is what makes them fun!To be fair, of course, if youre looking to Hot Pursuit Remastered as a racer, rather than a crash simulator, its probably significantly better. The game conveys the feeling of speed incredibly well, and regardless of whether youre racing through the desert or along the coast, you can practically feel the wind in your hair.But you can basically get the same thing from any number of Need for Speed games in recent years. As far as Im concerned, what set Hot Pursuit apart was the combat  and honestly, if youre after high speed racing, big crashes, and a remastered game from a decade ago, I dont know why you wouldnt just get Burnout Paradise Remastered instead, since that blended them a lot better. Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is still above-average as racers go, but if youre like me, youll probably come away from it feeling like its not quite as great as you may remember.", "date": "November 6, 2020", "grade": "B"}
