{"name": "Donut County", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/01/donut-county-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Im not one to replay games. For the most part, once Im done with them, thats it for me  regardless of whether or not I liked it, Im on to the next game in my ever-expanding backlog. But when Donut County came out on the Switch, I jumped at the chance to play it again.Why? Simple: because I had so much fun playing it the first time around on PS4, I wanted to confirm that the fun translated to other systems.Short answer: it does!This really shouldnt come as a surprise. After all, Donut County is a pretty short game, which means that I didnt have a chance to get sick of it when I played it on PS4. The characters are all delightful, the script is funny and well-written, and the game play  which consists almost entirely of sucking the titular county down a hole, and occasionally launching things back up in the air  never gets old. There may not be anything new here, but what there is stands up well enough on it own that there doesnt need to be.Mind you, because it doesnt add anything new, my biggest complaint about the game still stands. It feels like so much more could have been done with this premise, so once youre finished the game, youll be left wanting more.But if my biggest complaint about a game is that I desperately want a sequel, that should be a sign that its doing something right. I dont know whether one of those will come, but even if it does, Im still glad that Donut Countys release on new platforms means that I  and, I hope, many other people  will get to chance to either experience it again, or experience it for the first time. Regardless of whether camp you fall in, its fun enough that it wont disappoint.", "date": "January 9, 2019", "grade": "A"}
