{"name": "Amnesia: Memories", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/10/amnesia-memories-review-for-ps-vita-pc/", "text": "What is it with visual novels and obnoxious characters? Steins;Gates protagonist was a thoroughly unpleasant jerk. The Xblaze games are packed full of people who cant stop bickering with each other. Even Hatoful Boyfriend wasnt immune to it, with many of its avian characters proving that just because youre a bird, it doesnt mean youre less obnoxious than a human. I freely admit that Im not versed in anime tropes, so maybe Im missing out on something crucial, but I just dont get why game built entirely around human interaction have so much trouble showing them interacting in any kind of believable way.It doesnt take long for Amnesia: Memories to reveal that it embraces this tradition. The game is barely a few moments old when all of a sudden you find yourself stuck in a conversation with someone who cant stop insulting you. You soon discover that a) youre fresh off a major head trauma and b) the person youre talking to may or may not be your boyfriend, but neither of those things stops him from constantly telling you how stupid you are. It should come as no surprise that the rest of this game follows in a similar vein, with everyone you meet first remarking on your head injury, and then making fun of you for being slow.Whats baffling about this is that the game doesnt seem like it should be so abrasive towards its main character. After all, Amnesia: Memories is ostensibly as much a dating simulator as it is a visual novel. Youre tasked with determining your relationships with five different men/teenage boys, and pursuing one of them to a happy ending. Not only that, most of the dialogue has a breezy, carefree feel, and the game doesnt take itself too seriously most of the time  I mean, the reason youve lost all your memories isnt just the head trauma, its also the fact an alien spirit accidentally knocked out your memories. Youd think that the factors would cause the game to embrace the cheesy romance factor, rather than make you wonder why the character wants to pursue any of them, when there are presumably guys out there whose romantic game doesnt begin and end with negging.Having said that, when Amnesia: Memories focuses on the story rather than the relationships, its kind of interesting. Treat the game as a mystery in which youre trying to figure out the circumstances behind your injury, and it doesnt do a bad job of meting out the facts in a way that will get you hooked. Were not talking an Agatha Christie-level whodunit or anything, but at the very least it approximates a fun Choose Your Own Adventure mystery.", "date": "October 14, 2015", "grade": "B"}
