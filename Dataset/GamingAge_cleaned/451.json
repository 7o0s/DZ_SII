{"name": "Sling Ming", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/07/sling-ming-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Ive been working on my review of Sling Ming for a couple of weeks now. Heres what I have so far:*ahem*Perhaps the most surprising thing about Sling Ming is that its not a mobile game thats made its way over to the Switch.Seriously, thats literally the only impression I have of the game after playing it off and on for a couple of weeks. Its not good enough to leave a lasting impression, and its not bad enough to make me lament its existence, either. In every way imaginable, its adequate.It really does seem like a mobile game that made the jump to the Switch, though. The controls  assuming you dont use touch controls  are incredibly simple, and require you to move the titular Princess Ming along rails to the exit. Sometimes you have to move those rails around to avoid obstacles, and other times you need to rely on motion and momentum to give her that extra bit of oomph to get around a corner (though, as far as I could tell, the game doesnt actually feature motion controls, which seems like an oversight).If Sling Ming has any kind of distinguishing feature, Id guess it would be insane difficulty spikes, coupled with shockingly hard challenges on every level. Luckily, the challenges are optional, which means you dont need to devote hours to grabbing one extra coin or shaving a millisecond off your time just to move on to the next level. Even so, while the controls are simple theyre also lacking in precision, which means that youll be looking at a world of frustration if you devote yourself to beating some of those challenges.I wouldnt advise it, though. Given how profoundly forgettable Sling Ming is, it doesnt seem like you should be getting all worked up just for your own personal satisfaction. If youre not super into mobile gaming but you want to recreate the experience on your Switch, then it might be kind of worth checking this game out, but its not going to be the end of the world if you miss out on it, either.", "date": "July 31, 2018", "grade": "C+"}
