Somehow Shinrai  Broken Beyond Despair manages to be both.First, the bad creepy. Shinrai is a visual novel that seems to be set in Japan, full of Japanese characters (or, at least, characters with Japanese names), who occasionally speak in broken Englishexcept it wasnt made in Japan. The developers seem to be German, as far as I can tell. Im not someone who immediately jumps at using phrases like cultural appropriation, but it kind of fits here. At best, it seems like a misguided way to demonstrate a love of Japanese visual novels  and the less inclined you are to be charitable, the more offensive it feels.That said, Shinrai is also has some of the good kind of creepy, too. Its a visual novel featuring a murder mystery with some nods towards gory VNs like Corpse Party, and  weird cultural references aside  it all flows pretty well, right down to the different branching storylines that lead in different directions.On top of that, Shinrai is more than just an endless series of dialogue trees. It also gives you the chance to explore crime scenes and piece together evidence, and it does a good job of making you feel like your choices make a difference.But again, its very easy to give Shinrai a pretty hefty dose of side eye. It may have been made with the best of intentions, and it does an okay job of being an homage to its influences, but the route to get there could have been a lot less off-putting.", "date": "May 18, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
