Its a point-and-click adventure that places a huge emphasis on its story, yet it often feels like the game is in such a hurry to get from Point A to Point B that it omits huge chunks of the narrative, to the point that it barely makes sense. On the one hand, I kind of wish the game had actually told the story that it was seemingly trying to tell. On the other hand, however, what is here is so lousy, I cant say I wouldve welcomed the game being any longer than it was. Its a real dilemma.Then again, who am I kidding? Its really not. Just Ignore Them has enough problems that even with a complete story, I cant imagine it would be any more worthwhile. The puzzles arent particularly challenging or interesting. Theres none of the bonkers logic that typifies some games in the genre  as easy as it can be to complain about combining random objects to solve nonsensical puzzles, at least they give their games some personality. Just Ignore Them has none of that.Its not very scary, either. While the game starts off with the protagonist as a young child trying to avoid monsters, it gives up on that pretty quickly, and instead goes all-in on the story and takes the main characters completely out of danger.Which takes us back to the central problem of Just Ignore Them, which is that, as a story, it sucks. The characters are flat, bland and boring, feeling like horror movie tropes who barely even justify being called stereotypes. The dialogue feels more like someone took a script, ran it through Google Translate a few times, chopped out random sections, and then plopped it in here. Theres a beginning, a middle, and an end, except they have so little connection to each other, its hard to care.Ill note that Just Ignore Them might, bizarrely, be the victim of censorship. I found a PC playthrough that seems to be a tiny bit longer than the console version, which a) contains the occasional risqu line, and b) fleshes out the dialogue enough that the game wouldve had a little more cause and effect going on  or, at least, would have at least explained some parts of the story so that they didnt seem to come out of nowhere (though it still wouldve seemed fairly disjointed). Im not sure why they would have been excised, since the random bits of vaguely suggestive dialogue were no racier than any of the dialogue thats included in the console version of the game  plus were talking about a game that already has an M rating. Nonetheless, theyre not here, and the game is the slightly worse for it.", "date": "January 27, 2020", "grade": "D+"}
