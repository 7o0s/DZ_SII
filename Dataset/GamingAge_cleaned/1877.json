{"name": "Battlefield 4", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/11/battlefield-4-review-xbox-360-ps3/", "text": "As I begin this review I must say that the Battlefield series probably never intended to be at war with a competing title when they launched with Battlefield 1942. It doesnt take a rocket scientist for publishers to figure out there was gold in them there hills when they looked at the insane sales that Activisions Call of Duty series racked up for the last few years. Honestly with Call of Duty having such an amazing following one would argue if it were even worth trying to go head-to-head with the FPS juggernaut knowing that going in it would be an uphill battle. Nevertheless EA and the team at DICE believed that they could not only supply the video game masses with a solid military FPS, but in many ways could even out do CoD in some of their online implementations. So the developers are determined to keep up the good fight, which brings us to this years incarnation of the Battlefield franchise  Battlefield 4.While this review is based solely off the Xbox 360 and PS3 version supplied by EA, you have to keep in mind that there are technical issues, bugs, and flaws that may not rear their ugly head on the PC or the upcoming PS4/Xbox One versions that they most certainly built this game for. I must also mention that many of the inconsistencies and visual flubs oddly came from the single player mode but not so much from the online portion. This makes things clearly evident that the developers really were gunning hard to take on their rivals since online is their main focus as well.I will get the bad out of the way first which deals with the games lackluster single player campaign. The games single player mode fails the gaming public in many areas including a shallow 5 hours of game play and a stale storyline. While I can foresee playing this in the not too distant future on my Xbox One and with the obvious graphical enhancements maybe finding a small glimmer of excitement with making my way through the campaign one more time, I cant in all honesty say that the games campaign didnt provide anything I havent seen numerous times before in other war shooters or films. No matter if it is on the land, in the sea, or in the air, I just never had a moment that made me go wow! In many ways I felt like I was sleep walking through this journey as if I had already been here before, even though it is an entirely new adventure. If you are not taking the next gen leap, however, keep in mind that there are some very bothersome texture and player models and effects that come off looking quite silly and unrealistic. Not only does this come from the architecture of buildings collapsing, and players being blown to hell and even disappearing, but even things like rain will for some reason become all funky and distorted over time. This doesnt all necessarily come from the Frostbite engine, but more from the conversion and downgrading trying to get this game to fit on our 8 year old tech contained within the Xbox 360 and PS3. I will say that there are times the game does look downright brilliant, but more times than not it fails to just keep up and is mostly inconsistent in its technical presentation.Where Battlefield 4 shines like a Medal of Honor is the amazing online modes that more than make up for where the game lacks in solo missions. After a long night of taking guys out of the online Battlefield, you will know where your 60 dollars were well spent. Not only are the visuals online as impressive as offline (with the texture install of course) with full damage to the environment and physics damage provided by the Frostbite engine, but it seems to be more stable than what was seen in the glitch filled single player mode. You have a great wealth of modes to play through online, including Conquest, Team Deathmatch, Obliteration, Rush, Squad Deathmatch, Domination, and Defuse, but the maps designed for each mode are incredible in both detail and scale. Here you also have a great number vehicles at your disposal that you can either man or take part as a gunner, both of which are equally enjoyable on the road to victory. Impressively, the knowledge that your role in the fight isnt broken down to the simple sniper or shotgun roles from the past, as you have a deep customization for your soldier to allow for mid range weapons and gadgets so you can do your part with the proper equipment. The most ingenious difference between Battlefield 4 and other FPS of its kind is how not only do you earn XP, but how it correlates and creates a significant difference between squad soldiers and commanders. If you are in a squad, you are rewarded with more offensive options for your leaders to deploy, and these commanders can call for those reinforcements, overhead air raid attacks, and most importantly, gain the loyalty of the team to do the best they can in each battle. Each multiplayer mode utilizes the games maps and options a little differently, but none of them take a great deal of learning to be able to jump right into.", "date": "November 4, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
