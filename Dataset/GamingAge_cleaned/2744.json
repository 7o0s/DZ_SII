SEGA has slowly rendered this excuse moot as they have collectively re-released the titles on the 8th generation of consoles and PC. While the PlayStation consoles got these titles first, SEGA nearly brought parity across the three platforms in the west as it finally released The Yakuza Remastered Collection on PC and Xbox (Currently the only hold out is Yakuza 6: Song of Life and Yakuza: Dead Souls).The Yakuza Remastered Collection consists of Yakuza 3, 4, and 5. Yakuza 3 deals with series mainstay Kazuma Kiryus life outside of the Yakuzabut somehow he gets pulled back in Yakuza business. Yakuza 4 sees additional protagonists added to the mix as the ramifications of a mob hit that occurred in 1985 boil over in the present day. Yakuza 5 sees Kiryu and others embroiled in another Yakuza conspiracy also players will finally take control of a female playable character, Kiryus ward Haruka as she navigates another seedy industrythe idol industry.Unlike the two Kiwami titles, the titles in the remastered collection only got resolution and refresh rate enhancements (1080p and 60fps). Visually and mechanically it will be a bit jarring for players who cut their teeth on the series with 0 and the 2 Kiwami games. However those who can forgive these shortcomings, this collection is still quite a value. With 3 titles whose play time can clock in around 20 hours each and even more if you indulge in the plethora of mini games and substories, its an absolute steal that the bundled price is $40. The value is even better as this package is available to members of Microsofts Game Pass program.Would it have been better if these titles got the Kiwami treatment that the first 2 titles did? Yes! However Im sure this work would have hindered the studios ability to work on the post-Kiryu titles. Its a small sacrifice which would enable a greater good and frankly this move will enable titles that never saw western releaseseven if theyre not Kiwamid.", "date": "February 2, 2021", "grade": "B+"}
