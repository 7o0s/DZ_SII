{"name": "Tales from the Borderlands Catch a Ride", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/06/tales-from-the-borderlands-catch-a-ride-review-for-pc-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "Despite clocking in at roughly the same running time as previous episodes, the third episode in Telltales Tales from the Borderlands series feels remarkably epic. Theres all sorts of angles being worked in Catch a Ride, and some surprising callbacks to both the original Borderlands and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. We get to see some more familiar faces, along with new ones, as we continue down the somewhat bumpy path laid out before Rhys and Fiona.This episode picks up with the cliffhanger of episode 2, with Rhys, Fiona, Vaughn, Sasha, and Loader Bot at the mercy of Vasquez and his hired goons. Your decision at the end of the last episode directly affects the beginning of this one, and things start out with a bang as the group attempts to make a daring escape, and runs smack dab into who I assume is meant to be this storys big bad. The introduction of this new villain gives some promise of a legitimate threat to the group, more so than the overconfident actions of Hyperion goon Vasquez.Events at the beginning of this episode also lead to a new teammate of sorts for the group, who might be one of the most purely positive, and likely the nicest character Ive ever seen in a Borderlands branded game. At one point Rhys makes the comment that this character is refreshing, and I couldnt agree more. Also, some of the best laugh out loud moments come courtesy of this characters interaction with the group, so I certainly believe this individual to be a welcome addition here.But along with new faces, we get a couple familiar ones as well. The aforementioned Borderlands and Pre-Sequel ties come into play during the final sequences of this episode, and for long-time fans I think the showdown featured here is pretty cool. I wont go into great detail on this, so hopefully you dont mind some general vagueness in regards to the last moments of Catch a Ride.A couple other things to note. This episode seems pretty action-heavy to me, theres still a number of quiet moments and dialogue options to wade through, but theres also a whole lot of QTE segments. Thankfully, those segments arent frustrating or difficult to complete, I just noticed throughout that I couldnt really put the controller down for long without some sort of prompt appearing on screen. Also, playing this via PC, this is one of the most technically sound episodes of a Telltale game Ive played in quite some time. No weird stuttering, no missing models, no issues with previous choices carrying over, everything ran really smooth and without a hitch.", "date": "June 23, 2015", "grade": "A"}
