The best games the genre has to offer are the ones that you keep replaying in your head the moment you close your eyes. Tetris, of course, is the obvious example, but there have been plenty of other games over the years that fit the description. Personally, lately Ive had Subara City on the brain, to the point Ive even had the odd dream about it.SEN is not the kind of game that sticks in your brain. Partly, I think, this may be by design. It prides itself on being a minimalistic puzzler that almost never explains anything thats going on, so theres a certain degree of complexity built in that other, simpler games dont have. SEN isnt exactly impossible to figure out  indeed, the early levels are as basic and easy as they come  but it never makes things totally obvious.On top of that, the nature of the game means that its not the kind of thing that sticks in your brain as easily. You have a series of dots, some numbered, some not, and you have to link them in order. Again, while the early levels are pretty basic, around halfway through the difficulty ramps up, to the point you have to really plan everything out. In other words, its not the kind of game that lends itself to obsessing over in the same way that you would a Tetris. Youre not making move after move after move; youre sitting there, staring at the game, until you finally make one or two moves to finish the level.The game also has a weird attitude toward saves. Basically, you cant stop partway through a series of levels: you either finish all of them, or you start them over from scratch, with no picking up where you left off. Even if none of the levels are that long, it still makes it harder to get into SEN. Again, if you think of the classic puzzle games, you think of ones that are designed to pick up and play  not ones that force you to play through an entire level, with the threat of redoing whole levels if you dont finish them.", "date": "February 19, 2020", "grade": "B"}
