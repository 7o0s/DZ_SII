{"name": "The Innsmouth Case", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/05/the-innsmouth-case-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Youd think that The Innsmouth Case would be one of the more unusual games Ive ever played. I mean, not only is it based on the works of HP Lovecraft, its also a choose your own adventure-style visual novel thats presented as a book. How many other games fit that description?Turns out, at least one other: that exact same description could also be applied to Omen Exitio Plague, which came out a little while back for the Switch (and a few years before that on PC). So, niche as that description may be, its now a subgenre of at least two.While both games are good in their own ways, if I had to choose between playing/reading one or the other, Id likely pick The Innsmouth Case every time. Why? For the simple reason that its a lot funnier.Dont get me wrong, its also got its fair share of cosmic eldritch horror. The game boasts of 27 endings, and in true choose your own adventure tradition, many of them end up with your character dying, often in fairly grisly ways. So even if there are plenty of goofy trappings and one-liners, this game isnt entirely for the faint of heart.But the thing that really sticks with you  and the thing that really makes the game stand out  is the comedy. At every turn, The Innsmouth Case allows you to lighten the oppressive mood with a silly one-liner, a funny insult, or a self-aware wink. In one playthrough, for example, my detective found himself in an arcade, where he ended up playing a mash-up of House of the Dead and Resident Evil. Rather than immediately getting into shooting zombies, I opted to continue reading about the games opening cutscene  which led to an amusing digression about the detective and the other arcade-goers getting engrossed by the story of a pharmaceutical companys backstory before it accidentally created zombies.(Trust me, its a lot funnier the way the game tells it.)This is emblematic of The Innsmouth Case as a whole. While you can certainly play it straight, its a lot better if you take all the weird detours it offers  and the end result is a game that, even if its not 100% unique, is still well worth checking out.", "date": "May 27, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
