{"name": "Oddworld: Strangers Wrath HD", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/01/oddworld-strangers-wrath-hd-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Having played nearly every game thats come out on the Vita to date, I feel comfortable saying this: I dont think theres anything on the system that fits it more perfectly than Oddworld: Strangers Wrath HD.Dont get me wrong, there are certainly better Vita games. If I were putting together a list of must-haves, I dont think Id put Oddworld alongside the likes of Gravity Rush, Persona 4: Golden, or Uncharted: Golden Abyss.But in terms of games that that showcase the Vitas graphical capabilities, and at the same time provide an experience tailor-made for on-the-go gaming? Oddworld combines those two things more capably than anything else Ive played.Oddly enough, what makes it work so well is its relative lack of plot. I mean, it has one, of sorts: you play as Stranger the bounty hunter, and youre collecting bounties so that you can pay for some mysterious surgery. But  notwithstanding a bit of a twist near the games end  thats about all there is to it. Strangers Wrath doesnt mess around with subplots, or romances, or anything else that could bog it down. Youre just running from town to town an Old West-influenced world, capturing bad guys dead or alive.In other words, its a plot that lends itself to quick, short(ish) missions  something you can play on your Vita in short bursts, something that wont require you to remember back story or complex gameplay mechanics when you whip out the device for some quick gaming. Its easy to imagine Oddworld becoming horribly repetitive if you were to sit down on the couch and expect it to sustain you for hours on end, but in this kind of context, it works quite well.The game is helped, too, by the fact it looks and sounds fantastic. Everything about Oddworld is richly imagined, from the wide-open spaces and vast canyons, to the towns filled with quirky townsfolk. Even if the plot probably wont draw you in, its setting does a great job of putting you in the right mindset to enjoy the game as soon as you pick it up.", "date": "January 23, 2013", "grade": "A"}
