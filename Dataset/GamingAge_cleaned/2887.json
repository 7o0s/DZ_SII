If you look at its individual parts  anime-inspired graphics, 2D metroidvania platforming, turn-based combat, party management  literally none of it appeals to me. But when you put all those pieces together in this package, magic happens and its suddenly one of my favourite games of the year so far.Part of it, I suspect, is the games sense of humour. While Indivisible is by no means a joke game, its definitely one of the funnier games Ive ever played. The characters are all quick with solid one-liners, and they manage to be snarky and sarcastic without being obnoxious about it. Thats a tough balance to strike, but its pulled off here expertly.That said, I think the even bigger part of why the game works so well is because all those elements I usually dislike are done really well in this instance. Take the graphics. Sure, theyre indebted to anime  main character Ajna has a pet that looks like it belongs in Ni No Kuni  but like, say, Studio Ghibli, the game is understated in a way you dont usually associate with the genre, if that makes any sense.Similarly, the platforming here is done well enough that you wont mind all the backtracking and constantly checking maps. The way the worlds here are laid out it feels like youre progressing naturally, rather than going through the usual metroidvania loop of new ability-new area-repeat. As for the turn-based battles and the party managementthey dont bring anything new to the table, but I still liked them, perhaps because theyre so closely linked. The gist of Indivisible is that Anja keeps encountering new people, who then get sucked into her head (sorry, her inner realm), and she can then use those people to fight alongside her. Even as the cast swells, the game does a great job of differentiating the characters, not just by their abilities, but also in how they react  which goes back to why humour is such an important element of the game.", "date": "September 3, 2020", "grade": "A"}
