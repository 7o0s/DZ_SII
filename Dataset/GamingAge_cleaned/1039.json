After all, its predecessor, SteamWorld Dig, was a decent-sized hit across a multitude of platforms. Lots of people, myself included, were eager to see what Image & Form would do next with the franchise. And in response to that anticipation, the developers released a follow-up that has absolutely nothing in common with their first game. It was a pretty bold move on their part  one that, to their credit, absolutely paid off.My colleague Dustin Chadwell covered SteamWorld Heist when it first came out on the 3DS last year, and truthfully, pretty much everything he said then goes double for the PlayStation versions. Its still a unique take on the turn-based strategy genre. Its still got an enjoyably intuitive combat system. And its still got oodles of steampunk charm.For what its worth, I think SteamWorld Heist is actually far superior to the first SteamWorld game, for the simple reason that its a much more focused experience. Whereas Dig had a fairly open-ended approach, and just encouraged players to go out there and dig as far down as they possibly could, Heist has a more linear narrative structure and a more straightforward approach to exploration. It lays out its interstellar world in a clear, easy-to-follow manner, and theres no guesswork as to what youre supposed to do next.It applies this straightforward approach to individual missions as well: when your ship docks at a new station, you know exactly what your goals are. Whether its eliminating all your enemies, capturing all the loot, or doing any number of other tasks, you never have to double-back and wonder whether youre missed something important. For those people who just want open-ended exploration and digging, of course, this may come as a letdown, but if you want to see the SteamWorld aesthetic applied to a coherent story, this is the game for you.", "date": "August 29, 2016", "grade": "A+"}
