But even by those low standards  and were talking about a standard that includes a game that you could Platinum simply by moving right  DonutsnJustice is pretty lacking inwell, pretty much everything.For starters, it only has six short levels, so were not talking about one of those Ratalaika games where the Platinum pops much too early. You have to beat the game, but that should only take you half an hour  15 minutes if youre playing on Thumbsucker difficulty.On top of that, virtually nothing in this game is memorable, save for the very last boss fight. (Im not going to spoil what happens there, but I will say that it takes part of the games name to a weirdly literal place.) Up until that point, DonutsnJustice is nothing more than your standard side-scrolling beat-em-up/shoot-em-up game, where you (and a friend, if you want), keep going right as wave after wave of bad guys tries to take you out. You dodge around the screen for a few minutes, shooting at enemies and picking up guns and donuts (the latter giving you a health boost), and then you reach the end and face down a fairly easy boss. Repeat that six times, and youve got your game.Honestly, it took me more time to write this review than it did to finish DonutsnJustice. If you feel like spending 20 minutes with a game youll forget within moments of finishing it, heres the game for that, but I dont see why youd want to bother.", "date": "July 14, 2021", "grade": "D+"}
