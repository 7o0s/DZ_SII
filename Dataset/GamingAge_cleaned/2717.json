Most of them  at least in my experience  tend to be either love story or slice of life, usually with a bit of sci-fi and/or mystery thrown in.Swordbreaker has a bit of sci-fi, and a bit of mystery, but thats where the similarities end. Instead of the genres usual tropes, this is a game where you do come across orcs, giant cockroaches, and succubi. Where you have the option of aligning with an evil necromancer named Belchiflatus (which should also give you an idea of the games maturity level). Where, in one of the many branching storylines, you have to choose between going to see Fred Crocker, a doctor who looks exactly like Freddy Krueger, or visiting a gynecologists office. Where, for no reason whatsoever, you come across an alien spaceship that crashed into the castle.And, above all else, where the game strongly encourages you to kill literally everything you come across. It doesnt matter if theyre good or evil, trying to harm you or trying to help you, it inevitably seems like one of your options is killing whatever or whoever youve just met.Naturally, they can kill you too, which means that nearly every choice you make in this Choose Your Own Adventure-style game isactually not that far off from the original CYOA books, if my memory serves me correctly.It goes without saying that the whole thing is pretty silly. But thats not necessarily a bad thing, given how incredibly serious so many visual novels take themselves. I wouldnt say that Swordbreaker is a beacon of hilarity or anything, but because its not trying to say anything deep or pretend to be more than it is, its actually kind of fun.To be sure, youll need to be fond of visual novels if youre going to play it. No matter how many monsters you slay, youre still only reading it here, not actually doing anything. But if youre looking for a visual novel thats like nothing else the genre has to offer, Swordbreaker The Game may be right up your alley.", "date": "March 9, 2021", "grade": "B+"}
