{"name": "Dishonored Definitive Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/dishonored-definitive-edition-review-for-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "I guess calling this version of Dishonored a Definitive Edition isnt entirely inaccurate, provided youre willing to ignore the PC release of the original. Recently released for PS4 and Xbox One, it features some slight graphical upgrades, all the DLC and retailer bonuses from the previous releases, and of course the original content that hit PS3 and Xbox 360 back in 2012. And, much like it was in 2012, Dishonored is a fantastic experience, one of the best stealth-action titles of last-gen, with even less competition in that space for current consoles.But nothing about this Definitive Edition really stands out as exceptional or interesting. The improved textures seem mostly insignificant. Dishonored was a pretty good looking game back in 2012, thanks in large part to the art style used. Here it looks a little sharper, a little clearer, but by and large youll be hard-pressed to see much of a difference between the two versions. Even more so if you go back and compare this to the PC release, which on a decent rig can look quite nice, and can exceed the 30 frames per second that youre still locked into here.Thats not to say that Dishonored itself is particularly marred by this version of the game. The adventure of Corvo throughout Dunwall is still just as engaging and fun as it was in 2012. Corvos unique mix of ever-expanding abilities provides one of the most interesting stealth experiences youre likely to have ever played. The ability to zip around from location through location by teleporting, the sensical cover and line of sight mechanics, and the freedom of choice in how you tackle the various encounters are all masterfully presented. And the Definitive Edition doesnt mess that up, it just doesnt add anything of note outside of the DLC packs (all of which are worth playing).If you skipped out on Dishonored when it originally released, or dont have the option of playing on a PC, then the $40 asking price for Dishonored: Definitive Edition isnt that steep. You get a great game, some solid DLC, and a technically sound representation of the 2012 experience. But if youre looking for something on par with other remakes or ports in the past few years, youll do best to temper your expectations a bit. Again, this is still a great game, but its a port that unfortunately feels largely unnecessary.", "date": "August 31, 2015", "grade": "B"}
