{"name": "Element4l", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/05/element4l-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "It says something about Element4l that Ive been playing it on and off for about a month now, and I still have no idea what I really think about it. Is it a gorgeous, artsy platformer? An ultra-pretentious game thats nicer to look at than it is to play? I honestly dont feel comfortable saying either way.What I can say, though, is that my confusion stems from how incredibly difficult Element4l is. If Im being charitable, Id say that this is because its got a fairly unique control scheme, one that forces you to go beyond your usual expectations of how to control platformers into a more holistic way of thinking. Theres no forward, back or jump buttons; instead, as the title implies, you rely on your mastery of the elements to guide you. Youre not jumping from one ledge to another here. Rather, youre puffing yourself as an air bubble, pushing yourself forward as you change into a quick burst of fire, thumping yourself back down at the ground as a rock, and then gliding up and down inclines as an ice cube  and then, hopefully, landing on the other side of a gap or at the top of a very tall hill. Its tough  very, very tough  but at the same time, its a control scheme that seems fairly new and innovative.If Im not being charitable, though? Its a control scheme thats frustrated me to no end. Outside of the first tutorial, theres no such thing in this game as beating a level on the first try, because getting from Point A to Point B requires knowing every little dip and climb in between, so that you can plan out your moves accordingly. Theres also zero room for error, which means youd better constantly be on, or else its back to the checkpoint for you.Its a shame that the control scheme is so hit and miss, because otherwise thered be plenty to like about Element4l. It looks gorgeous, with the sort of muted, shadowy colour palette thats so common to artsier platformers these days. Theres alsoummerrokay, so its just the cool look and the interesting control scheme. But thats not nothing! Its certainly a lot more than many other games have.", "date": "May 11, 2015", "grade": "C+"}
