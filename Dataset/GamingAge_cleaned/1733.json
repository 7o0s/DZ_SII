{"name": "Titan Attacks!", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/05/titan-attacks-review-ps-vita-ps4-ps3/", "text": "Titan Attacks! is not a game that tries to hide its influences. Basically, its equal parts Space Invaders and Galaga.And thats it, really. There are upgrades and powerups and whatnot that may or may not have been around in the early 80s, but at the end of the day, the gameplay in Titan Attacks! will be familiar to virtually everyone under the age of50? 60? After all, Space Invaders and Galaga are two of the most widely-played, influential games ever, and its hard to imagine theres anyone out there with even a passing familiarity of gaming thats not acquainted with how those two games work. Aliens move sideways across the screen, getting closer and closer to the bottom, while you  as a tank  shoot them down. Like I said, its something everyone is familiar with, and if youre notI just have so many questions as to how you came to be reading this review.Because Titan Attacks! is so heavily indebted to those two games, Im not really sure what there is to say about it. When youre basically directly copying one of the archetypal ways of gaming, theres not a whole lot you can do wrong. The aforementioned powerups add a little bit of variety, but they still dont fundamentally change what youre doing. As youd expect (seeing as there have been all kinds of advances over the last thirty years), it looks a whole lot nicer, with vibrant neons combining with moody darker colours to give it a retro sci-fi feel. Titan Attacks! also sounds like a combination of old and new, with old school pew pew laser noises sitting alongside distinctly more modern downtempo electronic music.Obviously, thats about the only thing new going on in Titan Attacks! By any standard, its the very definition of an old thing getting a new coat of paint, so if youre going into it hoping for something new and fresh, youll be sorely disappointed.", "date": "May 6, 2014", "grade": "B"}
