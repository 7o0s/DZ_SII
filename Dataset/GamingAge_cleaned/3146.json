{"name": "Agent A: A Puzzle In Disguise", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/11/agent-a-a-puzzle-in-disguise-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "If you were to watch the trailer for Agent A: A Puzzle in Disguise, you might expect that its a jaunty, retro-fuelled spy game, where youre solving puzzles and engaging in a cat-and-mouse battle of wits with an evil super spy. And, if youre anything like me, youre super-excited by the prospect of playing a game like that.Unfortunately, Agent A is not that game. What Agent A is is hinted at right in its full name: its an adventure game with a bunch of puzzles, which are loosely tied together by a spy story thats told through a couple of cutscenes here and there. Its definitely got a sense of style, but when you get down to it, its basically all go to this room, get that object, go to another room, use the object to solve a puzzle, get a new object you can use back in the first room. Repeat that for a couple of hours, and you have a good idea of whats in store for you here.That, I admit, sounds much more negative than it probably should. Agent A is by no means a bad game. Indeed, the puzzles in has on offer are enjoyably varied, and require you to keep separate notes to help you keep track of important patterns and numbers. Its all fairly linear and set in a fairly small environment, too, so even if theres some backtracking, it feels reasonable enough (though make no mistake, youll be seeing a lot of the same rooms over and over again).Plus, as I said, its a fairly stylish game. Notwithstanding my complaints about its somewhat misleading trailer, the score (which is silent far too frequently) and art all do a good job of evoking Saul Bass, which is what I assume they were going for.Still, if you want anything more than a few nice-looking puzzles, you wont really find that in Agent A. Its a fine little puzzle game that you can fly through in five hours or so, but if you expect anything more than that youll be disappointed.", "date": "November 21, 2019", "grade": "B"}
