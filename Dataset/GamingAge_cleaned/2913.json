{"name": "Get 10 Quest", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/get-10-quest-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Even if you havent played Get 10 Quest, youve almost certainly played a game just like it. It follows very closely in the footsteps of mobile games like Threes and 2048, where you slide blocks around the screen to match blocks that are the same. In this case, youre matching blocks starting at 1 and moving upwards from there, rather than figuring out multiples, but the gist of it is basically the same.Mind you, Get 10 Quest is a little more complex than either of those games. For one thing, the board varies from level to level  there are basic squares, but the further in you get, the more the layout changes. As such, theres a lot more strategy at work here than you might expect.On top of that, the game features a surprising amount of variation on its relatively simple theme. Sometimes you need to beat the clock to achieve a certain score, sometimes you have to reach a certain number, sometimes you have to get a certain amount of several numbers, sometimes you have to eliminate all but one of the blocks  the core gameplay never varies, but the game shows that its a lot more than just a basic clone.", "date": "August 7, 2020", "grade": "B"}
