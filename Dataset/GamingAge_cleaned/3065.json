{"name": "Access Denied", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/02/access-denied-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "Now that Ive finished it  a task that took me a grand total of about 45 minutes  I feel quite comfortable saying that Access Denied really reminds me of The Witness.Note: coming from me, thats not a compliment.See, much like The Witness, Access Denied is a puzzle game thats built around inscrutable internal logic that may make sense to the people who made it, but that isnt necessarily as clear to everyone else. While there are some puzzles in which the solutions are obvious, its just as common to find a puzzle where you just click things around blindly until, at last and for no apparent reason, the puzzle box pops open and you move on to the next one.There are a couple of things that separate Access Denied from The Witness, at least in my mind. First and foremost, Access Denied is nowhere near as ambitious: its just a simple little puzzle game, set inside a small room, where you just unlock a series of 36 boxes. Even if youre as bad at spatial logic and reasoning as I am, it shouldnt take you all that long to get through. Seeing as I got angrier and angrier at The Witness the further into it I got, brevity is definitely welcome  though, at the same time, there was something kind of admirable about a game that was so all-in on its idea that it dragged it out for hours and hours. Where The Witness felt like an artistic statement (albeit one that I despised), Access Denied feels like an inconsequential diversion.Even worse, its an inconsequential diversion with lousy controls. Its a good thing playing on the Vita allowed me to use the touchscreen, because there were some puzzles where the thumbstick-controlled cursor was nearly impossible to use. And even the games touch controls arent great  I inwardly groaned every time one of the puzzles involved turning a safe dial, because it was practically impossible to get them to work. Its a good thing Access Denied didnt reward precision in puzzle-solving, because when it came to those dials, I was literally just stabbing at the screen until the lock face magically set itself to the correct position.If Access Denied was any longer than it is, the lousy controls would have been a problem. As it stands, however, they were more a minor bump in the road to a short, easy Platinum. Its up to you whether you want to endure those small bumps and obscure logic just for another trophy  and if you arent playing it for a trophy or a GamerScore, I honestly dont know why youd check this out  but it feels like there are better, more interesting ways to spend your time and money than on this game.", "date": "February 20, 2020", "grade": "C"}
