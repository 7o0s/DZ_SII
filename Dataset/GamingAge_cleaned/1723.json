{"name": "Waifu Impact", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/05/waifu-impact-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "I dont think itd be possible to go into Waifu Impact expecting it to be good. I mean, if the presence of the word Waifu right there in the title wasnt enough to tip you off, the fact its a game where you play as a girl in a bikini running around shooting other girls in bikinis with a water gun should probably tell you all you need to know.But even by the incredibly low standards of the genre, Waifu Impact is terrible. Theres no plot here, no convoluted explanation for why any of this is happening: the game just plops you down on a beach and tells you to find 25 stars. Along the way, you get to shoot a water gun, which makes your enemies flail about for a moment or two with some of the ragdoll-iest physics youve ever seen, before they explode in a grey cloud. Also, there are platforming sections here and there, except your character cant jump to save her life.I know, Im overthinking why people might be attracted to Waifu Impact in the first place. But even if youre in that weirdly specific demographic of people who really want to see cartoon girls in bikinis but dont know how to use the internet, this is still not a good game. The visuals are horrendous: the whole island looks blurry, pop-in is a constant challenge, the camera doesnt work, and its very easy to find yourself stuck inside a rock or underwater if you walk into either of those things at the wrong angle. Also, its prone to crashing.Heres how bad Waifu Island is: Id rather play a Senran Kagura game  and I hate Senran Kagura.Honestly, theres nothing redeeming about Waifu Impact. Its bad, its broken, and its boring, and theres no reason whatsoever to play it.", "date": "May 19, 2022", "grade": "F"}
