Its developer, 10tons, has a pretty good track record of porting casual mobile games to PlayStation platforms. Almost without fail, whether were talking Tennis in the Face, King Oddball, or Sparkle, Ive invariably found myself addicted to whatever theyve decided to bring over.The caveat here, mind you, is that I got hooked on all those games on my Vita. Neon Chrome is only on PS4 (along with Xbox One and PC). So the question for this game, as far as I was concerned, was whether Id find 10tons brand of casual fun as enjoyable on a home console as I did on a handheld.Short answer: nope.I should immediately clarify that I dont think Neon Chrome is a bad game. Its perfectly competent in pretty much every respect. It features a futuristic-looking cyberpunk aesthetic thats undeniably easy on the eyes. It brings in a mildly interesting roguelike twist, with procedurally generated levels to keep each new room seeming fresh and new. And ituhitummmHonestly, thats all I have to say about it. It doesnt do anything badly, but it also doesnt do anything so well that it makes you sit up and take notice. Its a pretty standard top-down, twin-stick shooter: you get a range of guns to shoot at a wide variety of enemies, and you slowly upgrade your attributes. Theres slight variety between the different playable characters, but not so much that its particularly noticeable. If youve ever played any game of this ilk before, youll know exactly what to expect here.", "date": "September 27, 2016", "grade": "C"}
