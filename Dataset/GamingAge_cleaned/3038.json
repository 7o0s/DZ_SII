{"name": "Assassins Creed: The Rebel Collection", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/03/assassins-creed-the-rebel-collection-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Even though Ive played quite a few Assassins Creed games over the years, my most recent one was the remastered version of Assassins Creed III that came to the Switch last year. That experience didnt go so well, which had me a little worried about playing Assassins Creed: The Rebel Collection. While I have fond  if incredibly vague  memories of playing both games included here (Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassins Creed: Rogue), Im also pretty sure I kind of liked Assassins Creed III when it first came out, too, and that didnt turn out well at all.Thankfully, Assassins Creed IV and, to a slightly lesser extent, Assassins Creed: Rogue have aged much better than ACIII. With the benefit of hindsight, you can see that Ubisoft learned the right lesson from ACIII: mainly, dont start your game with what amounts to a six- to eight-hour tutorial. Rather than wasting time on a lengthy backstory that gives you little in the way of freedom, both Black Flag and Rogue essentially get you into the game right away, allowing you to wander through their respective environments  both of which involve pirate battles at sea  nearly from the get-go. As you can imagine, its a huge step up.Also a step-up, though not quite as big: The Rebel Collections performance. While its not like ACIIIs performance on the Switch was terrible or anything, there were definitely points where you could see it struggling to keep up. You dont get that as much here, either with Rogue (which youd expect, since, after all, it was a PS3/360 game) or with Black Flag (which is a bit more of a surprise, seeing as its bigger in many ways than ACIII). Admittedly, this solid performance comes at the cost of looks, but a) both games still look better than, say, The Witcher 3, and b) were talking about a pair of full-fledged open-world games running smoothly on a handheld. Its a pretty impressive feat, and Ill take mediocre graphics if it means I get to play both of these games on the go.While The Rebel Collection may have the odd problem, theyre issues with the Assassins Creed series as a whole, not ones specific to this particular outing on the Switch. For example, the parkour here is occasionally a little less than precise, which means you may find yourself scrambling up a tree when youre trying to run around a corner, or walking daintily along a wall when youre trying to escape a mob of enemies in hot pursuit. This, however, goes for pretty much every AC game, not just Black Flag or Rogue. Similarly, youll notice some overlap between the assets used in both games here  but if you look back at the criticisms that met the games when they first came out, youd hear the same thing then, too.Whats really striking about the two games in The Rebel Collection is that, like I said up top, unlike ACIII theyve both aged fairly well. Both Black Flag and Rogue are excellent additions to your Switch library, and theyre well worth the dozens of hours youll get out of both.", "date": "March 17, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
