In fact, Id go so far as to say I wouldnt have to add for the most part to that first statement if it werent for the fact that the game generally performs so abysmally.Whats disappointing is that none of these performance issues are new. If you look back at our review of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 Plus on the Vita from eight years ago, youll notice that my colleague Dustin spent a large amount of time talking about framerate dips. These issues persist here, despite the fact that the Switch is a more powerful machine.How bad is it? Ill put it this way: as someone who really likes handheld ports of games and whos willing to put up with very sub-optimal performance, even I was a little put off by how bad Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razors Edge look here. Whats worse, the performance had serious gameplay repercussions, as it wasnt uncommon for enemies to pop in and out of existence while I was battling them. Given were talking about a game thats built around hacking, slashing, and blocking, you can see why that may be an issue.Ill also add that Ninja Gaiden 3 performs much, much worse than Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2. With the second game, while every new scene  and, at times, every new environment  looked atrocious, eventually things would settle down and the game would at least perform at a reasonable level. With Ninja Gaiden 3, however, it never even achieved that. The game looked fine during the cutscenes, but you could tell as soon as it switched over to the action on account of the fact the whole thing suddenly looked like garbage.One other unfixed flaw  though one thats intentional, rather than simply because of lousy porting  is something else that this very site touched on in our review of Ninja Gaiden 3, also from eight years ago. To be blunt, the camera sucks. It never moves quickly enough, or finds just the right angle, so youre constantly battling not just hordes of enemy ninjas but also the game itself. Admittedly, this is more a design choice that the developers never fixed than a problem with this specific collection of games on the Switch, but that hardly makes it any better.All that said, even with these flaws, this collection of games is still pretty enjoyable  though Ill note that if youve never played any of these games before, be aware that Ninja Gaiden Sigma and Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 are enjoyable in very different ways from Ninja Gaiden 3. While the first two games are obviously very violent, theres something almost balletic about the way protagonist Ryu Hayabusa slices and dices his way through his many, many enemies. Even on the lowest difficulty levels, theres a lot of emphasis placed on getting your timing just right. Both games give you ample opportunity to learn and to improve, so they never feel impossible, but theyre both demanding in their own ways.Ninja Gaiden 3 basically throws all that away in favour of brutal combos and covering the screen in blood. You can tell that God of War 3 came out between Sigma 2 and this game, because the gore is ramped up here to a ridiculous degree. The game delights in showing you literally ripping and dicing your enemies limb from limb. Theres none of the subtlety  such as it was  that defined the first time games. That said, its still a very fun game, even if its fun for completely different reasons than is the case for the first two-thirds of this trilogy.Even as I say that, however, Ive still got to go back to the games performance to add a caveat. The third game is funbut its also borderline unplayable at times when you combine the gore with the lousy performance. Its hard enough to see whats happening at the best of times; add in blood splashing across the screen, and youve got a recipe for zero visibility during some action sequences.Personally, though, that was a trade-off I was willing to make. As rough as Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection is in places  and its very, very rough  it makes up for that by also being a whole lot of fun. I leave it up to you to decide exactly how much poor performance youre willing to put up with to play a very enjoyable trilogy  because in this case, youve got to be wiilling to put up with quite a bit.", "date": "July 1, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
