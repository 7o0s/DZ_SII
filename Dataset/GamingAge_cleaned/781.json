This was a game I read a ton about and couldnt wait to play. Then it came out and I didnt get to play for several months after its release. This wait built up tension and nerve-racking anxiety that I couldnt wait to experience. While there have been plenty of games before it that have included scare factors into the games, nothing prepares you for what you experience in Outlast.With Outlast, my biggest love/hate about it was that you simply are unable to defend yourself. This is survival horror in its purest form. In the original, it took place in an asylum and took inspiration from games like Silent Hill and movies like Jacobs Ladder. This was the perfect atmosphere for Outlast and it worked in almost every way.In Outlast 2, the setting has changed and gives it a much more terrifying setting. Dont get me wrong, being in a claustrophobic asylum is enough to freak me out in the original. The thing is, its not until you experience Outlast 2, that you can truly appreciate legit jump scares and tension throughout the story. This time you are somewhere in the canyons of Arizona, and in between you will come across eerie villages, dilapidated churches and even your trippy mind game type of location transitions that the original had.One minute youre running for your life and the next you are in an elementary school classroom where things can get even weirder. This is Outlast at its best and the only gripe I really had with my time playing was the relentless difficulty. Clearly, this is a game thats out to punish you, but being a Soulsborne player, the difficulty can be a bit much. In the same regard, one could say, if it were real life, youd be dead. And theyd probably be right.The one mechanic that would help the frustrations would be a simple evasive move or the ability to knock something in the way to give you a couple extra seconds to escape. You can only run. I get it, thats something that this game is known for. At the same time, the restriction takes away from the overall experience at times.As you progress through the trippy acid trip filled story, I found myself more and more confused as to what is going on. One minute you are trying to find your wife, whom was taken by the crazy cult in the town, to being in the middle of a religious war between said cult and another group that is against the cults beliefs. Its as bizarre as it sounds and you need to play to get a better understanding as it contains spoilers.", "date": "July 28, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
