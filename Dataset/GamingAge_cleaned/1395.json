{"name": "Hyperdimension Neptunia ReBirth3: V Generation", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/07/hyperdimension-neptunia-rebirth3-v-generation-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "By this point, roughly six games into the series life on the Vita, Hyperdimension Neptunia handheld formula has been pretty well established. If you want a relatively standard JRPG, you look to the mainline games. If you want a little innovation  like, say, a pop idol management sim, or a Dynasty Warriors-style hack & slash adventure  you look to the spin-offs.Hyperdimension Neptunia ReBirth3: V Generation is a mainline game, which means  you guessed it  youre in for all the usual JRPG tropes, as filtered through the Hyperdimension Neptunia series somewhat skewed lens. Battle parties with up to four members, all of them representing one video game company or magazine or character. Turn-based battles against enemies that fall just on the safe side of copyright infringement. Lots of dialogue screens full of endless exposition and innuendos that are one meaning short of a double entendre. Basically, if youve played any of the games in the series  but especially any of the mainline games  its exactly what youd expect.To be sure, thats not inherently a bad thing. Like the other games in the series, Hyperdimension Neptunia ReBirth3 is crammed so full of jokes that it should come as no surprise that more than a few of them hit. Youd have to be made of stone to not crack a bit of a smile when you chat with NPCs like Snake Hayter (a person hiding under a box who talks about the need to be stealthy), Maryo (a mustachioed plumber with a red cap who complains about being forced to play the same game over and over again), or Player 2 (a tall guy in a green cap who complains about being in his brothers shadow). Likewise, cracks about games shipping in broken or unfinished states are as timely and relevant as ever. Obviously, the sheer volume of jokes, witticisms and fourth wall-breaking dialogue means that it would be almost impossible for the game not to have a couple land on target, but that doesnt make them any less memorable.Whats also welcome  surprisingly  is that this time around, the game uses its endless exposition for sorta-good, rather than to just drown players in information. There are a few moments in the game in which the characters step outside the scenes to explain who everyone is; as someone who found the series last mainline game a little overwhelming, this bit of explanation goes a long way towards not making you (or, at least me) feel completely lost.", "date": "July 6, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
