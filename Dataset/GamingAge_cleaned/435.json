That probably tells you more about the game than anything I could possibly write. Because, really, this feels exactly like the kind of platformer thats been around almost since the mediums birth.In part, this is because of the games looks. With its retro graphics, Super Skull Smash GO! 2 Turbo could very easily pass for a game that came out 30+ years ago. The character designs and environments are fairly basic, while the music and sound effects are as chiptunes-inspired as you might expect.Even more than that, though, Super Skull Smash GO! 2 Turbo plays like a game from the era. Contrary to what a lot of modern retro games would have you believe, that doesnt mean the game is tough as nails right off the bat (though it is undeniably challenging). What it does mean is that the gameplay is simple and straightforward: you jump around platforms, bouncing off enemies and collecting skulls, jewels, and coins. Occasionally the game will throw boss fights or lava at you, but it sets the basic template early on, and doesnt waver all that much.And thats okay. Super Skull Smash GO! 2 Turbo doesnt try to break the mold thats been around for several decades, but it doesnt really need to. It promises players retro-infused platforming fun, and, by any measure, it firmly delivers on that promise.", "date": "August 15, 2018", "grade": "B"}
