{"name": "Stranger of Sword City Revisited", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/05/stranger-sword-city-revisited-review-ps-vita/", "text": "I honestly cant figure out why Stranger of Sword City Revisited exists.Im not saying that its a bad game. Im not trying to insult the hard work that the folks at Experience Inc. did in making it. Im not even suggesting that its inconceivable anyone could enjoy it. Im just saying that, as far as Im concerned, it just might be the most inessential game ever.Consider what it is, after all: a slight expanded version a mediocre dungeon crawler that came out roughly a year ago. You can check out the changes for yourself right here, but none of them seem so important that they necessitate the creation of Stranger of Sword City Revisited. I mean, I guess if youre selling yourself as a dungeon crawler, the allure of even more dungeons is kind of a selling point, but why not just hold on to them for a sequel?Admittedly, theres a little more to Stranger of Sword City Revisited than a few new dungeons. There are new character classes, for one thing. Theres also a Guard Counter, that, true to its name, allows you to counterattack while defending. Similarly, the Slaying Challenge adds a twist to the usual Defeat Monster X to get this item by putting restrictions on how and when you can obtain certain rare items. Again, though, none of these changes represent much more than minor tweaks to the original, and seem like they couldve been held off for a full-blown sequel.", "date": "May 2, 2017", "grade": "C"}
