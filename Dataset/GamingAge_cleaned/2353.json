{"name": "Yakuza: Dead Souls", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/03/yakuza-dead-souls-review-for-ps3/", "text": "Yakuza: Dead Souls isnt your typical Yakuza title. It does have some familiar elements, but gone are the beat em up, random encounters that populate the first four titles released in the West. Dead Souls opts instead for action heavy, 3rd person shooting in a zombie ravaged version of Kamurocho, the popular stomping grounds for the Yakuza series.And unfortunately, the heavy focus on shooting doesnt make this particular entry a winner. Camera controls are a mess, forcing you to constantly babysit your desired angle, and often getting hung up when entering tight corridors or confined spaces. Theres an option to turn on an auto-reset thats meant to keep the camera behind your back when shooting, but that seems to have little effect most of the time.You can reset the camera behind you with a button press, which is somewhat of a solution, but youll find yourself constantly needing to do so because youre generally being attack from all sides. The only real fix the game gives you is auto-aim, meaning if youre close enough to an enemy and facing their general direction, youll probably hit them as soon as you start to shoot. Theres also the ability to lock-on for head shots for a limited time, but it doesnt work consistently.And its a shame that the combat is such a mess, because everything else about the game will feel instantly familiar to Yakuza fans. The storyline picks up after part 4, and gives you control of four characters from across the series, including main protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, the ever popular Goro Majima, Ryuji Goda from Yakuza 2, and the more recent Shun Akiyama from Yakuza 4.Like Yakuza 4, the game splits each characters role for different chapters in the game. Youll start off with Akiyama, and end with Kazuma, getting different perspectives for the zombie invasion thats plaguing Kamurocho. As each characters story advances, Kamurocho becomes more and more infested, splitting off the normal sections of the city with infested areas that youll be tasked with exploring by both the main story and sub-stories found throughout the city.Dead Souls is chock full of side content, with lots of optional quests to go on that are located by looking for waypoints on your city map screen. Theres also a lot of familiar content in the form of Mahjong parlors, Casinos, Club SEGA, Hostess Clubs, Batting Cages, Bowling Alleys, and more. Theres really so much to do here that youll probably spend more time playing through all the side content than you do the main storyline, which is fairly short when compared to the previous games.Visually the game isnt particularly striking, but retains the style of the previous entries. I suppose part of this could be in my head, but I remember Yakuza 4 looking better than Dead Souls. Also, Dead Souls has some serious frame rate issues, it will chug along with multiple zombies or monsters on screen, and if you introduce elements like fire into the mix, it becomes a literal slide show.Also, I found the story to be fun up until the last chapter of the game, which came off as a pretty big disappointment. It managed to make me feel as if the entire game had been a waste of time from a plot perspective, with no real impact on the characters or world around me. I realize that this is supposed to be more of a spin-off, and might not be considered canon, but because of that I was expecting a bit more out of the conclusion, which the game failed to deliver on.", "date": "March 19, 2012", "grade": "C-"}
