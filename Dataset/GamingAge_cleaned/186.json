{"name": "Metagal", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/05/metagal-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Stop me if this sounds familiar: Metagal is about a android cyborg girl out to rescue her creator, Dr. Light Ray, whos been kidnapped by his enemy, Dr. Wily General Creeper. To do so, she has to to fight her way through a series of robot bosses.In other words, the only thing here that isnt completely ripped off from Mega Man is that the game has a female main character. And while I get that representation matterssomehow, a thinly veiled reskin doesnt feel much like progress.Thats not to say that Metagal is a bad game or anything. It plays exactly as youd expect Mega Man  or a reasonably close facsimile  to play. Its a platformer with lots of shooting, with the occasional massive difficulty spike, and with a bunch of differently-themed levels. You can play the first couple of levels in whatever order you want  though if youre just in it for a Platinum or two (since the PS4 and Vita have separate trophy lists), you can get that in one level and well under half an hour.But again, the cost of all that is that youre playing a game that adds pretty much nothing to the Mega Man formula. Its hardly the worst thing in the world to be a reasonably okay Mega Man clone, but given that the originals are readily available on most platforms, its hard to know why youd want to play Metagal over any of those.", "date": "May 17, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
