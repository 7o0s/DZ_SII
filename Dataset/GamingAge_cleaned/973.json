If anything could be said about the last time we saw Paper Mario in full form, its that audiences were divided on the outcome. The series took a hard left from its Thousand Year Door roots of story-driven RPG bliss and took a joyous romp through card-based combat. Loads of combat, to be exact, and to a fault, according to players.But hey, youre in a review from one of the few publications that really liked what Sticker Star was doing. So sue us. Wait, is that possible? Dont sue us; love us. Love us like we love Paper Mario; unequivocally, unabashedly, and yes at this point its easy to tell whether were head-over-heels for Paper Mario Color Splash.Between the now and then of Sticker Star, Nintendos done some soul-searching. Last years E3 demo found fans apprehensive that theyd be getting Sticker Star with a new coat of paint, but hopefully theres no need to resort to further puns in getting across how well-rounded Color Splash truly is. Well get into that later on, but theres something to get out of the way just now.Admittedly, Im a sucker for a pretty face, but Color Splash is a wonderful-looking game with an even better sounding soundtrack. One that prompts me to use words like divine to describe the instrumentation and composition of each areas themes. I was immediately reminded of grousing at how Nintendo was proud of Mario Kart 8s live soundtrack when fans thought they should focus more on gameplay and other Wii U software. They were right to be proud back then, and they should be just as lauded for their work on Color Splashs musical score. Its jazzy, snappy, and delightful in variations on old and new themes. If youre wondering when this paragraph about the soundtrack is going to end, try to understand that Ive likely accumulated at least a few hours of playtime listening to unlocked music in the games Museum.Where were we? Aesthetics, right. If Nintendos first-party output will be remembered of anything on Wii U, its going to be the commitment to realizing an arts & crafts in games like Yoshis Woolly World, Kirbys return to clay, and Color Splashs continuation of cardboard and paper assets. Color Splash isnt just a sharp-looking game, but the art team displays a total comprehension of Paper Marios style  capitalizing on the world-building at any opportunity. Objects are folded, crumpled, filleted into sheets when destroyed, and all with a great sense of texture and lighting to enhance an already interesting look.Anyone familiar with Paper Mario will probably be just as taken with how well-represented the series is in full HD.Lets talk about the game itself. Marios on vacation this time, arriving at an island where color has been drained from locals and the surrounding area. Once paired with an energetic paint bucket and color-powered hammer, players are off on their journey to return color to the world, apprehend the culprit, and generally restore peace to the land. Sounds good? Great, on to details.Color Splash is broken into two parts for mechanics, being the turn-based battles, and the hammer which splatters paint onto surfaces in the game world. Players familiar with Sticker Star will be familiar with the return of card-based combat, in which they hold a deck to choose attacks from  flicking to the top screen, into battle. Color Splash employs a few extra steps, mainly the conceit of filling the cards in with color to power them, and while this allows for a more versatile economy (colorless cards are a fraction of normal price in shops), it becomes tedious in the long run. UI elements appear above or below cards when selecting, painting, and finally flicking them upwards to activate, and this flow never became second nature. The last thing you want in a turn-based game is to give players any more reason to be impatient about the combat, but here we are with Color Splash, prolonging the fights.This is more of a side effect Marios hammer having a paint meter at all. In the overworld, the meter runs down slowly as players color in levels, solving puzzles and being completionists, but becomes a frivolous mechanics if thats all were given to do. Nintendo is famously reluctant to add entries to a game series without feeling theyve innovated somehow, which leads to hit-or-miss concepts. While I wouldnt call the color meters a miss, theyre definitely not a hit either. Rather, theyre simply fine, with the small annoyance of dragging out battles a bit. Its really not as bad as I may be indicating, but its one of the very few objections I have to Color Splash. I wouldnt know what to replace the meters with, but the idea seems shy of something truly creative.As for the story, Nintendos brought in the A-team on writing. Characters are affable, the pace is great, and the level of quality outclasses a lot of what other self-aware games hope to achieve. Great writing isnt just throwing a load of puns at players  its also great design, and knowing how to play with elements of a game itself. Early on, our heroes are snuck up on between conversation bubbles, when an enemy suddenly appears after the final bit of dialog. This is the difference between Color Splash and other games, even Sticker Star, who at times struggle to give players more than the time of day and a new goal. Color Splash has a great sense of self, humor, and most importantly, timing.Other bits to love are filling in the overworld map, or the fact that theres an overworld map in the first place. Players are given opportunities to freely explore previous levels, discover collectibles, and play at their own pace. Because of this, finding free battle cards is an easy process, and on an odd note, I was almost always maxed out for coins. Its possible that I didnt take full advantage of the games resources (or maybe the opposite), but Color Splashs difficulty seems to take a backseat more often than not. If anything, its a leisurely RPG that presents enough of a challenge to keep players attention, but unlikely to demand it for any combat. Puzzles, however, are around, and in line with the writing, cute and clever.", "date": "October 31, 2016", "grade": "A-"}
