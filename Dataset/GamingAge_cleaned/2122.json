{"name": "Corpse Party: Book of Shadows", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/02/corpse-party-book-of-shadows-review-for-psp-ps-vita/", "text": "Three things I should probably admit right up front:In other words, I may not be the best person to pass judgment on whether Corpse Party: Book of Shadows succeeds as a sequel, or as a horror game, or as a faithful localization of the original. I can, however, tell you this: if you want an unsettling experience that leaves you a little shaken by its over-the-top gore and off-putting atmospherics, this is the absolute perfect game for you.Actually, Im not sure that even begins to fully capture the madness that is Corpse Party: Book of Shadows. For one thing, calling it a game in the usual sense doesnt do it justice. Its really more a digitized Choose Your Own Adventure novel. Youll spend the vast majority of your time with Book of Shadows reading through endless screens of text. There are the odd moments of player urgency  you can choose which rooms to visit, you can decide to explore certain rooms a little further, you can even occasionally make a decision about what course of action youre going to take  but for the most part, much like those CYA stories from the 80s, the game funnels you from one point to the next.In fact, if you think of all the endings in those Choose Your Own Adventure novels that ended with you dying, that comparison seems even more appropriate  though those old books have nothing on Corpse Party: Book of Shadows when it comes to inventing new ways for people to die. Heres a short list of some of the ways people are killed in this game: their bodies get drained of blood. They get their legs cut off/they get their bodies chopped in half. They get their bodies crushed against walls (this one had a vivid description of how the various skin and organs clung to the splatter). They get their heads crushed (like a watermelon, as the game helpfully describes). They get their heads ripped off partially. They get their heads chopped off entirely. They get burned to death by boiling oil, leaving teeth as the only recognizable body part. They get disemboweled alive.On top of that, theres all the non-fatal injuries, coupled with liberal doses of pure grossness. People cough up chunks of hair. Black blood starts flowing out of a female characters vagina. One character gets dropped into a room filled with dead and decomposing school children. Ankles get shattered with hammers. One person starts chewing on anothers neck. Rooms are full of jars filled with decomposing meat.And so on and so forth. Basically, if youve got a weak stomach or youre easily disturbed (both of which I am), youre probably going to find yourself fast-forwarding text  especially during some of the particularly descriptive chapter endings. Though be warned: youll still get to hear all the stomach-churning sound effects (some of which give a whole new dimension to the descriptor bone-crunching as it relates to video games), and youll still have to see the screen flash red (which makes the injuries seem a little more realistic).Now, having said all that, Id be lying if I didnt find myself drawn in by the story. Even without any prior knowledge of the characters and what happened to them in the first game, the game did an excellent job of making me invested in them  which, of course, made their grisly ends all the more disturbing. I suspect that people who played the first game will get even more out of it. Consequently, because of that, Id say that if youre remotely interested in this game but never played its predecessor  and if you like really gory horror, you should  do yourself a favor and download the first Corpse Party before you play Book of Shadows.", "date": "February 14, 2013", "grade": "B"}
