{"name": "Star Wars Battlefront", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/11/star-wars-battlefront-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "Star Wars Battlefront is a technical marvel for first-person (or if you prefer, third-person) shooters. Its absolutely gorgeous, with massive recreations of environments from the original Star Wars trilogy that you know and love. The sound design is equally impressive, with tons of recognizable sound effects set against the backdrop of the familiar themes from composer John Williams. And it runs so smooth, seemingly regardless of platform, with little to no hiccups or technical issues to be found. Its easily one of the best looking, and best sounding, games released this year. And hey, its also a whole lot of fun for this Star Wars fan.As we inch ever closer to the theatrical release of The Force Awakens, Star Wars Battlefront hits store shelves at a point where the Star Wars fandom fervor is in full swing. But even if this was some sort of off year for Star Wars, I think Battlefront would still stand out nicely. It does lack some modern bells and whistles found in other first person shooters, but it makes up for that with easy to pick up and play controls, a hefty number of modes, and some really satisfying, large scale battles featuring heroes, vehicles, and villains that were all familiar with.Theres little that Ive played this year that can compare to setting off on Hoth, with Snowspeeders and TIE Interceptors whizzing by overhead, while two large AT-ATs lumber forward in the far distance. All around you theres laser fire, explosions, smoke, and combatants running from one trench to the next, setting up turrets, manning turbolasers, and capturing objectives. Theres so much spectacle, that just when you think you cant find anything more stunning, you hop on a speeder bike on the forest moon of Endor, and youre wowed all over again. I came across a number of jaw dropping moments while playing Battlefront, and Im sure you will too, as theyre certainly hard to miss.That said, Star Wars Battlefront does have a couple areas that could have used a bit more refinement. Unfortunately, progression is one of those areas. Completing matches, wrapping up randomly assigned objectives, killing enemies, and winning rounds will net you experience, which in turn levels you up and grants access to new weapons and Star cards. The latter of which can be slotted into a hand that you bring into battle, with each card mapped to your top left, top right, and Y/Triangle buttons on the controller. Gaining experience can feel a bit slow, even after spending a fair amount of time with the game over the past week, Im in the mid-teens level wise, which means Ive got a long way to go before I reach the cap of 50.But, outside of my general enjoyment for the gameplay, theres not enough to keep me interested in increasing my level. The weapon unlocks are lackluster, featuring weapons youll likely recognize from the original trilogy, but most feel very much the same compared to one another. Theres long-range and short-range blasters, but its hard to really get a feel for any major differences, outside of rate of fire or damage. Theyre certainly bland to look at, and once you get access to the E-11 or the DL-44, theres not much incentive to change, even if youre unlocking weapons later down the road (which ideally would be better or more effective).To go along with that, the character customization, most of which is also tied to leveling, dont add much in the way of noteworthy modifications to your character. A lot of the early options for both Rebels and Imperials consist of bald heads, beards, or a combination of both. Hardly anything to get excited for, and certainly nothing that seems like itd be worth spending in-game money on. I do wonder if DICE was a little hamstrung in how creative they could get with things, but the ability to change uniform color, or add some additional flair or markings to Stormtrooper armor, would certainly be nice. Also, alternate outfits for some of the hero characters would be cool, along with some customization for the X-Wings, A-Wings, AT-STs and so on. Its amazing how detailed and incredibly good looking the locations can be, while the actual characters you control are remarkably drab and uninteresting.", "date": "November 23, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
