{"name": "Agatha Christie  Hercule Poirot: The First Cases", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/08/agatha-christie-hercule-poirot-the-first-cases-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Its interesting to contrast the way video games have treated Hercule Poirot with how theyve been to Sherlock Holmes. Holmes, obviously, is much more popular  thanks, I suspect, to the fact hes in the public domain  but games starring him have ranged from mediocre to terrible. Poirot, meanwhile (whose literary outings are still mostly owned by the estate of Agatha Christie), has been much less well-represented, but the most recent game starring him was at least decent.That trend continues with Agatha Christie  Hercule Poirot: The First Cases. While its similar to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One in that it offers a look at a younger version of the titular hero  one, it should be noted, thats not based on any of Christies writings  thats pretty much all the games have in common. Much like the last Poirot game, The ABC Murders, Hercule Poirot: The First Cases is a leisurely stroll through a couple of intriguing mysteries. Poirot moves unhurriedly through a few crime scenes, interviewing suspects, gathering clues, and making deductions. As you can tell, theres not a lot of action to be found here. In fact, its the deductions part of the above paragraph that actually forms the bulk of the gameplay in The First Cases. Every clue you gather, whether its a physical piece of evidence or an interesting revelation in an interview, gets added to a mind map, and its up to you to make the connections between the most incriminating clues.For the most part, the mind map works. The deductions here are generally pretty straightforward, so they usually make sense. That said, at times it feels like youre being asked to take three or four steps where one would do  that is, you can see where the game is leading you, but it also asks that you take a bunch of extra deductions, which makes the game feel a little padded in places.Just about my only criticism of the game is that The First Cases can sometimes feel a little too unhurried. While this may help ensure you dont miss any vital clues, at the same time, when Poirot has to slowly walk back and forth between rooms or suspects that are a little far away, it can feel a little frustrating.Of course, its not like Christies Poirot novels were jampacked with action sequences, so in that respect Hercule Poirot: The First Cases doesnt fall far from the tree  which, again, is even more impressive when you consider that this is others building on Christies work, rather than being based on one of her novels. The First Cases is a good tribute to one of the classic characters of fiction, and anyone who likes to curl up with a good mystery should find this to be to their liking as well.", "date": "August 22, 2022", "grade": "B"}
