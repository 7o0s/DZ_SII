{"name": "Crazy Strike Bowling EX", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/06/crazy-strike-bowling-ex-review-ps4/", "text": "Im not entirely sure why Crazy Strike Bowling EX exists. I dont think that the original PS3 version was such a massive hit that people were clamouring for a slightly nicer-looking version on PS4. Likewise, theres nothing about the port that suggests it needed to be brought over to the PS4 in order for it to fully achieve its developers vision. Near as I can tell, its just here for the heck of it.In fact, even thats probably giving this game far more credit than it deserves. When you check out the tutorial, it spends a shocking amount of time going over the PlayStation Move controls, which either a) marks the first time anyone has even remembered that PlayStation Move still exists in a non-VR context, or b) tells you pretty much all you need to know about how much effort was put into bringing this game over from the PS3.Of course, its not like Crazy Strike Bowling was some massively complex game to begin with. Were talking about a game that features six playable characters, all of whom are basically interchangeable. This is due to the fact that the controls are super simple: one button press for your throws power, one button press to release, and as long as you get the timing right in the middle on the latter  which, admittedly, is harder than it sounds, because of some pretty severe input lag  youre pretty much guaranteed a strike every time. Things are a little more varied when it comes to the environments, but even that has a pretty hard limit in terms of creativity, seeing as were talking about bowling lanes.The twist  that is, the whole reason this game is crazy  is that you also have the option of playing the game with power-ups and obstacles and such. These dont add to the game in any way. In fact, they generally make everything worse to the point of unplayability, and youd be wise to avoid them.", "date": "June 28, 2016", "grade": "C"}
