{"name": "Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/10/alfred-hitchcock-vertigo-review-for-switch-pc-playstation-xbox/", "text": "It should come as no surprise when I say that Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo (the game) doesnt live up to its movie namesake. I mean, Hitchcocks Vertigo is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, whereas this game isnt even one of the best games released in the last few weeks, so you can see why Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo might fall a little short if were comparing the two.But what if we made the comparison a little fairer? What if I said that I dont even like the movie version that much (acknowledging I only saw it once, nearly 20 years ago)? Does Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo come off any better with the movie having that handicap? Somehow, it still doesnt. Even though there are literally at least two dozen Hitchcock movies Id rather watch than Vertigo, Id still say that this game comes off much worse from the comparison.Oddly enough, however, my reasons for disliking the two are awfully similar. Just as the movie version of Vertigo features James Stewart in one of the least likable roles of his career, Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo focuses on a writer named Ed Miller, an entirely unlikeable, obnoxious protagonist who antagonizes everyone around him.However, where the movie Vertigo had the benefit of Stewart being one of the best actors of all time (and, admittedly, has a story in which his unlikeability is an important part of the plot), Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo just features a main character who sucks as a person. Were told early on that hes supposed to be a great writer trying to overcome writers block, except the brief glimpses we get into his work suggest hes just a hacky, angry edgelord. Its hard to care about anything that happens to him or his story when you just want to get as far away from him as possible.Its important to note that  as you can probably tell from that last paragraph  just about the only thing Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo has in common with the film of the same name is just that: the name. Otherwise it claims to be inspired by Hitchcocks broader oeuvre  modernized, they call it  except apart from some references here and there, the game has a lot more in common with Quantic Dream games like Heavy Rain or Beyond: Two Souls. There are all kinds of short quick time events that dont matter all that much in the big scheme of things, different dialogue options for each situation, and investigations where you can run time backward and forward to flesh out the story. It plays well enough, albeit without the high production values youd usually associate with a Quantic Dream game.While these lower production values dont impact the gameplay too much, theyre a lot harder to take in other aspects of the game. The characters look horrifying, for one thing, more humanoid than human. The eyes look all buggy, and the cheekbones look too pronounced, and no one looks quite like they should. Its unsettling, which youd think would be a good thing in a game thats striving to be Hitchcockian, but in this case it just seems wrong.Even worse, the voice acting is abysmal. Admittedly, the voice actors dont have much to work with  not even the greatest actors would be able to salvage this  but no one here seems to know how to deliver a line in a way that sounds remotely natural. Much like the characters themselves, the dialogue and the way its delivered are unsettling, but theyre unsettling because it all sounds so tin-eared rather than because its living up to its source material.Its also worth noting that some of the camera angles here make no sense whatsoever. You get extended scenes of the camera focusing on everything but the action. Its artsy, I guess, but it also makes you focus on the dialogue  which, as weve established, does Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo no favours.But, really, nothing does Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo any favours, because all of it is so bad. In terms of quality, its about as far removed as you can get from The Master of Suspense. Rather than playing this game, youd be much better off watching Vertigo, and Notorious, and Psycho, and Rear Window, and whatever other movies you could squeeze into the 10 or so hours it would take you to play Alfred Hitchcock  Vertigo, and I guarantee you that it would be time better spent.", "date": "October 10, 2022", "grade": "D+"}
