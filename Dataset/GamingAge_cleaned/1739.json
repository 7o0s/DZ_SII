{"name": "Cel Damage HD", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/04/cel-damage-hd-review-ps-vita-ps3-ps4/", "text": "Its hard not to come away from Cel Damage HD feeling as though youre missing something. Dont get me wrong, its a fun little gamebut unfortunately, the key word in that descriptor is little.Which is odd, because in the games description on the PlayStation Store, they make it sound like theres so much going on. Ten characters! Thirteen tracks/arenas! Over thirty weapons! Sure, theres only three game modes, but if memory serves correctly, the original Mario Kart only had three as well, and it certainly got along fine with such limited selection.The problem lies in what Cel Damage HD does with that limited selection. Whereas Super Mario Kart  or Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, or, to lower the bar significantly, Ben 10 Galactic Racing  chained events together in a way that made you want to keep playing them one after another, here you just have three match types, and all of them act as discrete events. Which is to say: there are 13 tracks, but what you do in one race/deathmatch/capture the flag match has no bearing whatsoever on what happens in your next match. Theres no Grand Prix championship or Star Cup or equivalent here  its just a couple of race options. For the first little while youre playing, you can try to unlock new weapons or arenas, but after youve done all that in an hour or two, theres not really anything more to do. The Vita version doesnt even have multiplayer  ad hoc or online  so its not as if you can try and match skills with other people. (In the games defense, both the PS3 and PS4 versions have local multiplayer, so if you have a couple of controllers, you can at least do that.)Of course, this lack of options is only an issue because, in its small doses, Cel Damage HD is pretty enjoyable. The characters are drawn in a wonderfully distinctive style, the tracks have a decent amount of variety and, most importantly for a vehicular combat game, theres a lot of fun weapons to use. Theres nothing quite on par with red shells or banana peels, to be sure, but giant razorblades and gatling guns have a certain charm to them.", "date": "April 30, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
