{"name": "Retro Highway", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/01/retro-highway-review-for-nintendo-switch-xbox-one/", "text": "My first reaction to Retro Highway was that it didnt seem to be anything special: just a motorbike version of an endless runner that borrows heavily from the likes of Outrun and Road Rash.Then, thinking about it more  and playing it more, of course  I realized that thats not exactly a genre overflowing with games. In fact, Id say that the very fact that Retro Highway seems so familiar and well-worn isnt because it just apes from games from a few decades ago, but it apes from them so well.Even though those games are older, its not as if theyre easy to capture what made them so enduring. Retro Highway does it because it borrows from them in the right places (Outrun more than Road Rash, to be sure), while adding a modern sensibility.By this, I mean they took the graphics and music from those 80s and 90s arcade racers, and added in the kind of one more go feeling you get from modern endless runners. They give you half a dozen tracks, each with their own unique aspects, except they lock all of them behind achievements that are fairly easy to rack up at first, but that gradually get harder. Likewise, while there are more than 10 motorbikes to ride in Retro Highway, you need to pick up coins during the races to unlock them  but every level seems to be overflowing with coins, so it always feels like youre making progress towards improving your ride.Also, the game gets the feeling of speed just right. That may not seem like much, but its harder than you think  I think back to (the very good) Horizon Chase Turbo, for example, and, as much as I loved it, it occasionally fell short in terms of making it feel like you were flying down the highway. Retro Highway doesnt have that shortcoming; even when you crash, it really feels like you have some crazy momentum behind your rider bouncing down the highway.This is all basic stuff, I know, but Retro Highway excels at getting it right. Given it doesnt try to do too much, thats essential  and its why it makes easy to recommend picking it up.", "date": "January 7, 2022", "grade": "A-"}
