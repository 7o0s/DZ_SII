Like, horrifically terrible, to the point that I barely made it past the first level. On some level, it feels wrong to have completed so little of a game before passing judgement, but considering how lousy I am, its quite conceivable that we could be into 2018 before I make any notable headway here. As such, Ill take my chances on reviewing it now, and assume that, a few levels in, it doesnt suddenly transform from 2D platformer to, like, dating sim or something.Ill also say two things in my defense.First off, the fact Im so terrible at Volgarr the Viking is by design. The games creators set out to make a quasi-impossible platformer in the vein of Ghosts n Goblins, and by and large, they succeeded. Theyve crammed monsters and environmental hazards into every square pixel of Volgarrs world, and they make you work to earn every inch you move forward. Theres no rushing headlong into battle here; rather, its a matter of entering a new section of the map, dying almost immediately, and then hoping you learned enough from your first death to try and get the tiniest bit further. In other words, constant death is a feature of the game, not a bug.However  and this is the second part of my defense  not only is Volgarr the Viking tough by design, its also tough because of its design. See, Volgarr does a lot of cool and gory things involving swords, spears, and other impressive weapons, but one thing he does not do is jump in any remotely useful manner. Getting him to jump forward is a constant struggle, which is kind of a big deal considering the number of times you need to make relatively precise jumps at important moments. Ill take my share of the credit/blame for sucking at Volgarr the Viking, but I want to make it clear that its not 100% on me.A lot of it is me, though, and I can totally see why others might love this game, even if the countless deaths drove home the point that this may not be the game for me. For one thing, as difficult as Volgarr the Viking may be, it seldom seems unfair or impossible. Sure, the jumps can be a little aggravating, but in general, when I died it was because I was overwhelmed by monsters, or because arrows came flying out of seemingly nowhere, or because of one of the many environmental hazards that populate this game.Which leads me to another point in the Volgarr the Vikings favour: death  both your own and your enemies  may come from a variety of causes, but all of them lead to satisfyingly bloody ends. Whether its the titular viking exploding in a burst of bones and guts or one of his many enemies, it all adds up to good, gory fun.", "date": "January 23, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
