Its gorgeous and its funbut its also very, very short, it has zero replay value, and its $10 on the Switch. And to top it all off, the game originally came out in 2009 as a web browser Flash game.I mean, its hard to put a price on fun, or on games that dazzle you with their creativity, as Windosill definitely does. It may only take about 15-20 minutes to complete, but during that brief time span youll get to solve a series of very enjoyable (but, admittedly, very easy) puzzles, and get to play with environments that are overflowing with life. Ive seen plenty of games that dont come anywhere close to this level of inventiveness over hours and hours of playtime.But again: its also a 13-year-old Flash game thats asking you to pay $10 for it. I think, in the end, it all comes down to how you look at it. If you look at Windosill and just see a game where you tap the screen a few times, move a train across the bottom, and finish it all in well under half an hour, its definitely not something Id recommend. But if youre looking for something that feels almost as much like a toy and/or a piece of art as it does a video game, Windosill might just deliver on that.", "date": "January 9, 2023", "grade": "B"}
