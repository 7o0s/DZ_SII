{"name": "Othello", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/03/othello-review-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Othello, coming to us from Arc System Works for the Nintendo Switch, feels pretty much at home on this fledgling piece of hardware thats bridging the gap between the home console and portable market. I dont think Othello will be taking the world by storm, but for five bucks, its a pretty decent representation of a game I havent played since the NES.If youre not familiar, Othello is based on a board game by the same name, or the non-licensed version dubbed Reversi. Youll compete against another player or the A.I., as you take turns laying black and white discs on a board in an attempt to convert the other players discs to your color. To do so, youll need to sandwich the opposing pieces between your own, causing them to flip over to your color. While the layout may look a little similar to Checkers at first, it bears little comparison outside of its looks. Outside of the local two-player vs. mode, Othello for the Nintendo Switch is a little light on modes or features. Theres no online play, which is disappointing but not necessarily surprising, and theres virtually nothing to the presentation here. The background music is forgettable, and while the look of the game is crisp and clean, its certainly not the most exciting use of the hardware. I did appreciate the difficulty slider when competing against the A.I., allowing you to sort of tune up the difficulty a bit and find the sweet spot between maddening and fair.", "date": "March 29, 2017", "grade": "B-"}
