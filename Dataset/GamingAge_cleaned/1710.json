Setting aside the relatively niche status of both the genre and the handheld, considering both the attention shown to the Vita by PC developers and the Vitas touch screen, it seems like the two should, in theory, be a perfect match for each other. Not only that, the adventure games that have come out thus far on the system  by my count, thats The Walking Dead, Jacob Jones Episode 1 and Machinarium (plus a few visual novels like Danganronpa and Zero Escape: Virtues Last Reward, if those count)  have all been excellent, showing that the games dont just work well in theory, but in practice, too.Further evidence, if you need it, can be found in the form of Broken Sword 5: The Serpents Curse: Episode 1. Of course, this shouldnt come as a huge surprise. Revolution Software have been making the Broken Sword games for almost twenty years now, so by this point theyre clearly aware of what works as far as game mechanics go, and what doesnt. Couple that with touch controls that are tailor-made for the games point-and-click action, and you can see why the bigger story would probably be if the game didnt work very well. (It should probably also be noted that this isnt Revolutions first foray into touch gaming; they re-released their first game, Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars, a few years ago on iOS.)Having said all that, the gist of The Serpents Curse is pretty much what youd expect from a Broken Sword game. Theres an ancient mystery to solved  in this particular case, the story involves a possibly cursed painting from the Spanish Civil War, Russian mobsters and Dominican monks, among other things  and George Stobbart and Nico Collard have somehow gotten mixed up in all of it. Its probably not giving away too much to say that there are puzzles to be solved and quips to be made, and I assume that it all comes together in the end  though I can only assume, since this is only the first half of the story.And that, if anything, is The Serpents Curses main flaw: that even though the full game has now been released on PC, Vita owners in North America are only getting the first half now, and need to wait an undetermined amount of time to see the ending. I understand wanting to release the game episodically, but still: it means that just as things here start to pick up, youre left on a cliffhanger, with no word yet of when the second half is coming out.On a less annoying note (and maybe not even on an annoying note at all, depending on your point of view), I should note that the game seems sort ofout of time, for lack of a better way to phrase it. Everything about it seems to have come from a time well before now, from the art style (vaguely retro-European) to the music (70s rock) to the way people dress and talk (again, from some point in Europes not-too-distant past). I dont say this as a criticism of The Serpents Curse, mind you, but rather a statement of fact. Outside of Europe and the adventure genre, they literally dont make games like this any more.", "date": "June 17, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
