{"name": "Undertale", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/01/undertale-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "As much as I liked Undertale  and I certainly enjoyed it  I feel like I didnt fully get it. After all, people dont just like the game, they really, really love it. Comparing my own mildly positive feelings towards the hardcore devotion the games fans feel towards the game makes me feel like Im missing something.I can see that it does things a little differently, mind you. Much has been made about the way Undertale encourages players to take a no killing approach, but the focus on this one facet of the game makes it easy to overlook all the other ways it plays with RPG conventions. The characters you meet are more than just one-sided NPCs; a real effort has been made to make them seem like fleshed-out inhabitants of the world youre exploring. Youre forced to interact with them on a much less superficial level than youd get in pretty much any other RPG that comes to mind, which makes for a more emotionally-involved experience than youd get elsewhere.Undertale reinforces this in its turn-based battles, which go beyond the choices you might expect and force you to get to know and understand the opponents with whom youre doing battle. Guard dogs, for example  cute little pups in medieval armour, for the record  prefer being petted and will go easier on you if they think youre also a dog, so those encounters become a matter of figuring out how to meet those two conditions. Similarly, you meet a woodland creature covered in decorations, so you have to figure out what approach will work best against this foe. While there are some repeating encounters, its important to note that each one is unique, which means you constantly need to think about every new character you encounter.Compounding this, of course, is the no killing thing. You can, for the record, kill as many of Undertales inhabitants as you desire, but the game has a way of making that seem less appealling than youd expect. Most games dont force you to feel empathy for characters who arent central to the plot, let alone stop and consider whether its right to mindlessly slaughter everyone you come across, which is an area where Undertale stands pretty much alone.The game also has a sense of humour, which is always a plus. I wouldnt say its in the league of, say, Portal, but this is still a game that isnt afraid to have a little fun. Admittedly, the humour is either absurdist or exceedingly gentle, so if you want an edge you wont find it here, but its all a part of the pleasant vibe that Undertale seeks to cultivate.That word, pleasant, may just be the best way to describe all of Undertale. I know thats nowhere near as strong a term as many of its devotees have used, but it feels entirely appropriate to me. The characters, the charmingly retro graphics, the interactions: theyre generally quite pleasant. I wouldnt say they make this a must-play game, but I would say that it means that if you play Undertale, youll likely have a grin on your face the whole time.", "date": "January 5, 2018", "grade": "B+"}
