{"name": "Forspoken", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/01/forspoken-review-for-ps5-pc/", "text": "I managed to go into Forspoken without hearing/reading/seeing much of the discourse surrounding the game. All I knew, in fact, was what I saw in the PS5 demo a few weeks ago, and I found that to be fairly positive. While I was vaguely aware people disliked the demo, I didnt know why, and I was interested  excited, even  in seeing what the full game had to offer. Not too much, it turns out. To be clear, its not the worst game Ive ever played. For all its flaws  and believe me, it has plenty of those, which Ill get to in a moment  it does have one clear positive: parkouring around the world can be pretty fun. Whether youre jumping across rocks or bouncing off enemies in combat, movement can be incredibly smooth.Its not that smooth all the time, though  which is as good a place as any to get into why Forspoken isnt a very good game. For starters, your character, Frey, doesnt always glide around the world. When youre inside the city, she suddenly becomes a lot less fluid in her movements: it feels like she either takes little baby steps, or she runs in a weird, jerky manner. Even when youre outside city walls and youre able to parkour around, it feels completely random as to what constitutes an obstacle: Fray can scale her way up cliffs effortlessly, but shell be completely confounded by a single step or a small object in her path.Of course, her movement is always graceful compared to everyone else in the game. It feels like all of the other characters around you can only walk in straight lines, so when youre following someone, youll watch as they beeline towards one point, then stop, pause, make a 90 degree turn, and go off on another straight line. Even when they run, they do the same thing.And none of this is even getting into how stupid everyone looks  Frey included  when theyre doing anything else. Showing characters speaking, for example, is a huge challenge for the game. Everyone has bizarrely shaped faces, with lifeless eyes, and mouths and cheeks that bulge out. When people talk, everything moves, but not in a way that comes close to looking like theyre saying the words that are coming out. Add in limbs that do the same movements over and over, and youre left feeling like youre watching someone make a flashy tech demo where all the bugs havent yet been ironed out.On a related note, one of my minor peeves about Forspoken is how it shows people eating and drinking. Early on in the game, theres a scene where Frey is handed an apple  an absurdly large purple circle, for the record  and it looks like she presses it to her face. Theres some chewing in the voiceover, but on screen shes just holding this circle to her face, and it looks silly. The same goes for when Frey takes a drink: it visibly looks like two objects mashing together, rather than like someone drinking from a cup. I know this is a minor issue, but the games lack of attention to small details really encapsulates why none of the bigger things land, either.Whats especially frustrating about it is that every so often, you can see glimpses of a game that looks really nice. There are moments where the game lingers on Frey for a second, and it looks insanely lifelike. Mind you, the moment she moves even an inch  and Im talking something as basic as opening her mouth  the illusion is spoiled, but for a brief instant, you can see why people were so excited about the game. Forspokens biggest issues, though, are all related to dialogue. And you want to know the crazy part? That encompasses so many different areas of failure. For one thing, theres just so much of it. Forspokens writers very clearly reject the concept of Show, dont tell, because this game features so much exposition. Its not enough that the game starts off by telling you Frey is sad because shes a street kid with no parents, they have her and other characters spell it out (which means, of course, more of the creepy movements that approximate dialogue). Every time anything new happens, it comes in the form of a long dialogue sequence, followed by a new entry in the games very lengthy journal. The writers put a lot of thought into every little aspect of the game, which is good, but then had no ideas on how to put it all into the game without constantly slowing things down to tell you about it.What makes this especially bad is that Forspoken has a built-in way to make sure the dialogue never ends: Frey has a magical talking bracelet named Cuffand its every bit as stupid as it sounds. It means the game can give you a constant travelogue about everything youre seeing, interspersed with annoying comments and one-liners from Frey and Cuff. You can turn it off if you want, but just the fact that Forspokens developers thought players would want a magical talking bracelet as a constant companion in an M-rated game is simply mind-blowing.Speaking of that M-rating, you cant help but feel like the M-rating comes down entirely to the language. Yes, theres regular combat against magical creatures, but its not exactly violent. Everything moves too quickly for it to be bloody, for one thing, and for another, when enemies die, they dissolve in a flash of gold. The dialogue, by contrast, features an insane amount of swearing. To be clear, theres nothing inherently bad about that  I know some people who probably couldnt make it through a sentence without dropping a few f-bombs. But in Forspoken it comes off as if the game was written by a petulant teenager who just discovered swear words exist. Of course, theres also the problem that it looks to bizarrely incongruous dialogues where Frey will sound like shes stepped straight out of the present-day (which, obviously, she has), and shes speaking to someone from this alternate universe medieval setting, and theyll mostly have no problem understanding each other. Every so often the game will remember that Frey and the villagers come from completely different backgrounds, and theyll have a moment where she explains something to them  like, for example, a scene where she explains a cell phone to little kids  but then theyll have her use modern slang and no one bats an eye. The lousy dialogue probably isnt helped by the fact that the voice acting is incredibly bad. Frey is fine, but everyone else here falls into two camps: either they go all-in on Ye Olde English Fantasy and sound like theyre auditioning for a role in a Shakespearean drama, or they sound like amateurs whove been dragged in off the street and told to make up an accent on the spot. I mean, kudos to the game for recognizing that a fantasy setting means they dont need to be bound by historical authenticity when it comes to skin colour and language, but when you have characters who sound like theyre being voiced by someone who has a vague idea of how a Southern European might sound, it ruins whatever illusion youre going for. And, while Im complaining about Forspokens dialogue, Ill also add this: theres a weird thing in the game where every time a dialogue sequence ends, Frey stands there for a few seconds as you wait for everything to start up again. It probably wouldnt be so notable if it werent for the fact it happens so often, but since, as weve established, this is a very talk-heavy game, you get plenty of moments where youre standing there, waiting to be able to move. Mind you, given how dull Forspokens combat is, Im not sure Id have preferred a game that was all-action, no-talk, either. While the parkouring helps  remember way up there, where I said its easily the best part of the game?  it doesnt get around the fact youre just rapid-firing spells at enemies until they die. This gets both tiresome and tiring during regular encounters with enemies who just take a few hits to vanish; during boss fights or encounters with large groups of enemies, it turns into lots and lots and lots of rapidly pressing the shoulder buttons. Its a little better when you unlock non-ranged combat several hours into the game, but that still means youre slogging through hours and hours of lousy ranged combat, which doesnt seem worth it. Overall, whatever benefits there are to the parkour elements being incorporated into battle are negated by the fact that combat is so incredibly boring.But thats Forspoken in a nutshell: its boring. Despite the sheer amount of words that have been written about the game  including by me, Ill acknowledge as I pass the 1,500 word mark on this review  the reality is that its just a forgettable, mediocre game. It does plenty of things very poorly, but it also does one or two things well enough that you cant say its completely and irredeemably awful. Theres no real reason to seek the game out, and theres no reason (apart, maybe, from that stupid talking bracelet) to avoid it at all costs: Forspoken is just kind of there.", "date": "January 30, 2023", "grade": "C-"}
