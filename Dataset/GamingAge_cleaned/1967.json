Despite the stereotypes, I dislike most winter sports: I dont care for hockey, I cant skate, and Ive been skiing twice in my life, the last time being about thirty years ago.Yet even someone like me is able to play Grand Mountain Adventure Wonderlands and feel like downhill skiing is the most relaxing sport in the world.A lot of this comes down to presentation. Not only does the small size of everything make it look like youre spying on some magical, snowbound village, the visuals have a gauzy quality that make the whole thing seem like a dream.On top of that, despite a decent amount of content  which frequently includes time trials  Grand Mountain Adventure Wonderlands doesnt have a huge sense of urgency. Youre free to explore the dozen mountains here, entering slaloms and jump competitions as you come across them  or, alternatively, you can just ski around, gliding down hills to your hearts content.Just about my only problem with it is that exploration isnt as easy as it could be. You move your skier in Grand Mountain Adventure Wonderlands by swaying from side to side, and while that couldnt be smoother when youre going downhill, its a little slow-moving when youre simply trying to go across even ground  or, worse, uphill in the places where there are no ski lifts.Even so, theres plenty to do in Grand Mountain Adventure Wonderlands that wont leave you frustrated. Theres lots of events, a nice variety of hills, and, as I said, the presentation is so gorgeous youll be lulled into a zen state. Even if youre not a fan of skiing, its one of those games thats so pleasant, its impossible to resist.", "date": "April 19, 2022", "grade": "B+"}
