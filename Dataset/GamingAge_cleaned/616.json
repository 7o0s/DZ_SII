{"name": "One More Dungeon", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/01/one-dungeon-review-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "Heres how much One More Dungeon borrows from the early days of first-person shooters: I played Wolfenstein and Doom less than a handful of times back in the 90s. I dont have a tonne of nostalgia for those early first-person shooters, and theyre definitely not a quick point of reference for me with retro-influenced games the way that, say, Super Mario Bros. would be with 2D platformers. And yet, my very first thought when I started playing One More Dungeon for the first time? Wow, this is just like Doom or Wolfenstein.Admittedly, there are some major differences, too. One More Dungeon is technically not a first-person shooter so much as its a first-person magic-caster and, er, knifer in which your unnamed character is running around a procedurally-generated dungeon, attacking various monsters with your magical staff and your knife. Rather than demons or Nazis, One More Dungeons protagonist is beset by monsters, ogres, bats, rats, and a wide range of other creatures. And, improbably, theres even less of a story here than there is in either of this games well-established antecedents: youre wandering through the dungeon fighting the forces of Evil. Not Nazis, not Hell, just: evil.Really, though, those are just cosmetic differences, since otherwise, the gameplay here isnt that different from something you couldve seen about 25 years ago. The dungeons have the same flat 3D feel that the likes of Doom and Wolfenstein established, with the objects in your way all looking like 2D creations in a 3D world. You also have to pick between ranged and melee combat, with the former being good for fighting off attackers, and the latter basically only being good for breaking down boxes.Andwell, thats it, really. One More Dungeon isnt exactly a complex game. Its a tough game, to be sure, and it doesnt give you anything in the way of handholding before it sets you loose in the dungeon and expects you to figure things out on your own. But outside of the learning curve  which can be measured in minutes  theres not much here that should surprise you if youve ever played some of those original FPSes. One More Dungeon offers some decent enough nostalgia for people pining for the early days of Doom, but otherwise, you shouldnt go into this game expecting too much.", "date": "January 17, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
