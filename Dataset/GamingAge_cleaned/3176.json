{"name": "Jet Kave Adventure", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/10/jet-kave-adventure-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Its fitting that Jet Kave Adventure is about a caveman, because its very clearly descended from the apes. Or, more specifically, one ape: Donkey Kong.See, Jet Kave Adventure is a 2.5D platformer that isnt so much the sum of its influences as it is a compilation of the greatest hits from Donkey Kong Country and that games various sequels over the years. The graphics are similar. The reptilian enemies are similar. The jungle-heavy environments are similar. Even the jetpack belonging to the eponymous Kave feels like it was lifted straight from Diddy Kongs back.But if youre going to steal, you may as well steal from one of the best, most enduring franchises, right? And, to Jet Kave Adventures credit, it doesnt do a bad job of the theft. The platforming is solid, if forgettable, and the game consistently keeps things moving along at a brisk pace. Its easier than any of the DK games, but given the kiddy-friendly vibe of the game, that probably isnt the worst thing.Also, in fairness, its worth noting that if Jet Kave Adventure is a clone, it at least looks like a well-made clone. The visuals are bright and appealing, and nothing here looks cheap. Its not going to make you forget where the game is drawing its influences, but its also not going to look significantly worse by comparison.Just about the only area where Jet Kave Adventure falls short of its influences is in its length: there are only 36 levels here across four worlds, and some of them are pretty short. Youll be able to beat the game in under three hours, which makes the $20 price tag seem a little high.But if the worst things you could say about Jet Kave Adventure are that it copies Donkey Kong Country and its a little shortwell, thats about right. Its not going to make you forget the original, and you may feel slightly short-changed as far as value goes, but Ive definitely played much worse than those.", "date": "October 25, 2019", "grade": "B"}
