{"name": "Jeopardy!", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/01/jeopardy-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Almost sneaking in at just under the wire, Ive found it: my most disappointing game of 2017.This, I realize, may sound like hyperbole, in a year where games like Star Wars Battlefront II and Mass Effect Andromeda generated all kinds of negative headlines and disappointed sighs. But, as far as Im concerned, its the absolute truth. I sank more hours into Jeopardy! on PS3 than I could possibly count. My wife  who generally has zero inclination towards video games  actually requested that we play it on multiple occasions. By contrast, this time out, shed lost all interest in playing about halfway through out first game together. Given that my spouse is exactly the sort of casual player Jeopardy! should, in theory, be appealing to, that should tell you a lot.And honestly, I dont blame her in the least. This is the blandest version of Jeopardy! I could possibly imagine. The PS3 version featured Alex Trebek, an audience, and the ability to make your onscreen players dance with happiness and throw their hands up in frustration. This has none of that.In fact, this doesnt have much of anything, beyond basic trivia questions. Sure, theres the basic Jeopardy! structure: answers in the form on a question, the basic Jeopardy-Double Jeopardy-Final Jeopardy structure, Daily Doubles, and so on. But thats it. Theres no Trebek, no personalized players, no cheering crowds. The previous game made you feel like you were really playing Jeopardy! (or, at least a home version of it); this one just feels like a trivia game with recognizable branding.Heres the best way I can describe it: my daily calendar this year has been Jeopardy!-themed. There were new questions every day, it gave dollar values for each question, and at the end of each week I could wager my weekly total in a Final Jeopardy! type-question. The experience I got out of that was pretty much the same as what I got playing Jeopardy! on PS4. Thats fine if all youre after is a bit of trivia; Im certainly partial to testing my knowledge of random factoids. But if youre looking for anything like the actual game of Jeopardy!, then keep looking, because you wont find it here.", "date": "January 2, 2018", "grade": "C"}
