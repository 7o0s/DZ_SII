{"name": "Aka", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/01/aka-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "I know Im in a tiny minority when I say this  and probably making my opinion suspect in the eyes of many  but Ive never been able to get into Animal Crossing. Theres just something about wide-open gameplay and focusing on day-to-day tasks that Ive always had a hard time getting into.You can imagine, then, how I reacted to Aka, which is basically a version of Animal Crossing (or any other farming/life sim) with even less focus and even more wide-open gameplay. I kept picking it up, playing for a little bit, and then finding my mind wander off to think about all the other things I couldve been doing instead.Admittedly, this is probably more my problem than Akas. After all, the whole point of the game is slowing down and just being. Aka is a red panda/retired soldier whos left the battlefield (which is literally the first scene in the game, in fact) in search of a quiet life, so the whole focus here is wandering around the small archipelago thats your new home, tending to crops, cleaning up debris, and doing tasks for your neighbours.And theres no reward or point to any of it. Youre just doing those tasks for the heck of it. Your neighbour needs help tearing down a fence? Youll tear it down for them, theyll thank you, and thats that. Rocks and metal traps and tree stumps interfering with the scenery? Youll gather them up and throw them out. Feel like farming? Then sow and water some seeds, and harvest them for yourself when the time is right.While its certainly admirable and good to do nice things just for the sake of doing them, it also makes Aka feel a little aimless. Theres only so much wandering around and existing you can do before you start to wish for a point to it all.The bigger issue with Aka is that its a little finicky and fiddly and buggy. Youll spend a lot of time in this game trying to manoeuvre Aka into just the right position to pick up logs and bundles of grass and everything else, and it almost always takes a few approaches to get the right angle. Youll also spend a lot of time trying to sort through menus, since, again, theyre not as intuitive as youd expect them to be in a game that features quite a few menus. There are a few tutorialmoments, for lack of a better descriptor, but they dont really explain much. And, to top it all off, you have to deal with the occasional bug  nothing game-breaking, to be sure, but things like loading screens taking too long, or landscapes that take a little too long to pop in, or other annoyances that dont seem terrible in isolation, but that add up to be a little grating.And its really unfortunate that Aka feels so aimless and annoying, since its a cute game that wears its heart on its sleeve. Everything here  from our red panda hero to the capybaras and dragons and yaks he has to befriend  looks adorable. The music is relaxing. The landscapes are dreamlike. Aka does everything it can to get you into its sleepy mindset.But that doesnt make for a compelling game. Aka clearly has its heart in the right place, but it doesnt have anything that goes a little deeper or that asks anything of its players, and without that it just feels like a cut-rate version of Animal Crossing.", "date": "January 13, 2023", "grade": "C+"}
