{"name": "Gundam Versus", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/10/gundam-versus-review-ps4/", "text": "While it may feel like we see a fair number of Gundam-related video games in the West, the fact of the matter is that we really only get a fraction of what Japan actually outputs. It is even more rare that we actually get a good Gundam game over here, so in that regard, Gundam Versus is a release thats worth celebrating. The series has been around for quite a while, but this marks the first Western release for the Versus series, and its a pretty good starting point for fans that have been oblivious to the existence of this franchise up until now.So what is Gundam Versus? The easy answer to that question is that this is a 3D arena fighting game. Youll select one Mobile Suit from an absolutely humongous list that spans decades of Gundam anime releases, featuring a whole host of fan favorite units. From there youll have a more limited list of Operators (think pilots), and Strikers (limited, auto-controlled assist units). Despite the large number of available Gundam, they all tend to control differently, with unique attacks and properties that set them apart from one another. I wouldnt go so far as to say theyre balanced, I think thats virtually impossible with a roster this large, but for the most part the units at least feel viable, whether youre facing off against the A.I. or other player-controlled units online.To go along with the unique feel of the 90 plus unit list, I think all of the Gundam available in Gundam Versus look pretty great too. They animate well, have a fair amount of detail packed in, and some of their attack animations are culled directly from their respective television series. Enough so that even a casual fan like myself can appreciate the amount of work that went into re-creating the various Mobile Suits present here. The same attention to detail does seem to be lacking when it comes to the different environments youll battle it out in, but the Gundam are clearly meant to be the focus, and that shows here.Gundam Versus also feels great to play, the act of actually piloting a Gundam, dodging enemy fire, and reciprocating in kind, is really engaging. The controls are fairly basic with multiple attack buttons for ranged and melee attacks, along with some limited boost and flight functionality for survivability. Some units can also defend against attacks, and every unit has a boost/super mode that it can deploy once the corresponding on-screen bar has been filled. Attacks come with different timings and cooldowns, and melee attacks can be further enhanced when combined with directional inputs. Its not hard to lay waste to other Gundam units, but perfecting how you do so while mitigating damage will take some practice.The in-game tutorial is lacking in this regard. Youre taught the basics, but against nothing more than a training dummy. Knowing when to attack and dodge, or how to string together an effective combo, is something that youll need to learn outside of the confines of what Gundam Versus offers. It isnt hard to find that material on the internet, but it would be nice if a little more effort was given to showing new players the ropes within the confines of the actual game.While Gundam Versus does feature some single-player content, most notably the survival wave based Ultimate Battle mode, youll likely be spending most of your time online against other pilots. Theres a few different versus modes available, including Player and Ranked. There are also lobbies where up to 16 players can congregate and pair off into teams. Gundam Versus as a whole is both a co-op and competitive experience. Every mode will pair you with another Gundam (either A.I. or player controlled), making this an ideal game to play with a friend. Unfortunately, youll have to play with that friend online, as local co-op isnt an option.Online play works fairly well, but like most games is entirely dependent on the location of other participants. Id find both heavy lag and zero lag with random match-ups, and outside of lobby play, your overall quality of connection will be pretty random. That said, there are a decent number of people playing the game online, and I had little to no trouble either finding active lobbies to join, or random people to play within Player and Ranked modes.", "date": "October 24, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
