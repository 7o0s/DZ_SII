Not only, as as Ive written before, have a not seen a Star Wars movie in literally decades (and quite possibly ever), Ive also never played this game thats widely hailed as one of the best-ever. While I was fairly certain that a knowledge of the films wouldnt have too much bearing on my enjoyment of the game, I was a little leery about the games all-time classic status  I mean, just because a game was great twenty years ago, that doesnt mean itll necessarily age all that well.Any misgivings I may have felt fell away pretty quickly  even if the game certainly looks like it came out almost two decades ago, it certainly doesnt play like it.In fact, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic doesnt play like many other games, which may be why it doesnt feel very dated. While the good-bad (sorry, Jedi-Dark Side) karma system has certainly been picked up on and improved since this game first came out, its still interesting to see such a big, expansive game give players so much control over how the story plays out.On top of that, the combat system is unlike anything Ive ever seen. According to Wikipedia, its similar to Dungeons & Dragons and other twenty-sided dice-based games  but as someone who never played D&D, I have to admit, its all new to me. Rather than launching your character and their squad into battle, you bring them to the battle, press a button to start the conflict, and then they start fighting on their own. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it works pretty well here.Just about the only place where Knights of the Old Republic feels dated is in its looks, as mentioned above. It lookswell, like youd expect a game that came out in 2003 to look. This is no hi-def remaster, so if you go in expecting something that looks modern, you arent going to find it here.But thats really the only area where the game doesnt shine. Otherwise, its very easy to see why Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic has such a sterling reputation so many years after it first came out. Unlike a lot of re-releases where you have to say It was goodfor its time, in this games case, you can say It was goodand its still good. Thats one heck of an accomplishment, and if you havent played this game before  or even if you have  its definitely worth seeking out.", "date": "December 21, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
