Its got characters from SpongeBob, Rugrats, Hey Arnold!, Ren and Stimpy, TMNT, and loads of other shows that have aired on that network over the past couple of decades. So if youve ever wanted to see what happens when Patrick Star, Donatello, Tommy Pickles, Korra, and Zim all race each other, youre in luck.Unfortunately, I cant say that describes me at all. See, Im Canadian, and we didnt have Nickelodeon, so by the time a lot of those shows reached up here, Id aged out of the target demographic. Which means, in turn, that Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2 would have to appeal to me on its own merits, rather than appealing to my childhood.And you know what? For the most part, it did.I mean, add in the usual proviso about any Switch kart racer thats not Mario Kart (which is, you know, that its not Mario Kart). This means that, even if the racers are based on established characters, they still dont have the same personalities you get from Toad or Luigi. Likewise, while the tracks are alright, they dont feel like they have the same feeling of history that you get from Rainbow Road or Toads Turnpike.Set that aside, though, and youll find that Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2 is actually pretty enjoyable. Theres loads of tracks here  28 in all, and even if they may not feel as distinctive as you might hope for, theyre still different enough from each other that you never feel like youre running the same race over and over again. Theres also loads of content. The 28 tracks divide nicely into 7 different Grand Prix cups, each with 3 difficulty levels, and on top of that, there are quite a few race challenges (i.e. get to first place before time runs out, hit a certain number of targets, etc.) that add to the variety.My favourite thing about Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2, though, stems from the games enormous roster. Not only are there 30 different racers to pick from, there are another 70 characters from which you can select a pit crew, each of them offering racers their own unique boosts and abilities. It adds an interesting level of strategy to decide how you want to balance your crew  do you choose the character who gives you a boost every time you get hit by another racers projectile, or do you pick the one who blocks everything around you, or do you take the one who shoots you forward with a hockey stick, or the one whowell, you get the picture. I may not know who the vast majority of these characters are, but that didnt mean I didnt get any less attached to the ones who made races much more winnable.And that, I think, is what sets Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix apart from, say, the SpongeBob re-release that came out earlier this year. Enjoying that game basically relied exclusively on nostalgia, and not much else. Here, nostalgia probably adds to your enjoyment, but even if you strip all that away, youre still left with a pretty solid kart racer that adds one or two things to the usual formula.", "date": "October 14, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
