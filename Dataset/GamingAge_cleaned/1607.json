Between opening credits and a feature called Sherlock vision that draw heavily from the shows current BBC run, and a slightly insane titular character that is, at the very least, inspired by Robert Downey Jr.s cinematic take on Sherlock, it seems pretty apparent that the developer wanted a game that existed, roughly, in the same space as the modern TV and movie versions of the character.The problem with that approach should be obvious just from reading it. Even making allowances for the source materials greatness, the big- and small-screen versions of Sherlock Holmes benefit enormously from being portrayed by gifted, charismatic actors. It doesnt matter how advanced next-gen systems are, theyre not able to create characters who can compete with Downey Jr. or Benedict Cumberbatch. Unsurprisingly, the comparison doesnt serve the game very well.It doesnt help, either, that the extra layer of gloss doesnt mesh very well with the Crimes and Punishments sensibilities. After all, were talking about a game that a) is set in Victorian England, and b) hasnt really changed its look in about a decade, if YouTube is anything to go by. To suddenly throw quick cuts and the aforementioned Sherlock vision on top of that is definitely a mismatch in style.Not that the existing style was  or, indeed, is  anything to write home about. Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments isnt exactly ugly, and I dont want to say that the graphics are terrible or anythingbut at the same time, this is a game that is stuck very firmly in the middle of the uncanny valley. Its as if the designers decided that Creepy Watson wasnt enough, and they had to go all out in making everyone in the game have horrible undead eyes. This is a problem since, as this a game thats all about detection, you spend a significant chunk of time interacting with people and staring into their eerie, lifeless faces.My problems with the game run far deeper than just superficial issues, too. For example, theres the weird mishmash of gameplay going on. On one hand, theres stuff like the aforementioned Sherlock vision, which is the most obvious example of BBC Sherlocks influence on the game, as you basically freeze time and make deductions about characters, as represented by floating words suddenly appearing on the screen. At the same time, though, almost everything else about Crimes and Punishments is slow-moving; you walk at a glacial pace around crime scenes and other places of interest, gather clues and (in theory, at least) forming deductions about whodunnit. Its a little odd to go from one to the other, since they seem like they come from two completely different games.Oh, and I say in theory about the deductions because thats another of the games issues. I mean, I dont know about you, but when I think Sherlock Holmes, I think of Holmes and Watson slowly, methodically solving crimes through reason. The answers may not be obvious, but at the same time, when Holmes reveals that someone is the who in whodunnit, you know hes caught the right person. Crimes and Punishments takes a moreidiosyncratic approach. You still investigate and you still make deducations, but the game allows you to deduce things and draw conclusions that are completely wrong. Not only that, you get to decide whether to punish the wrongdoers (who may or may not have actually done anything wrong), or let them go free. I get that the game wants to give players more agency and to not have each case have only one solution, but at the same time, this is Sherlock Holmes. Giving each case one solution is kind of the point, Id have thought.Given all my complaints, by this point you probably think I dont like the game. That would  to take a page from the previous paragraph  be the logical deduction, after all. Yet, surprisingly, I dont not like itwhich is to say, Im actually a fan of it. Crimes and Punishments may have an abundance of things wrong with it, but at its core, youve still got a pretty solid game. Yes, the gameplay doesnt quite fit together, and yes, the characters look like crimes against nature, and yes, the deduction system is a little flawed. But Sherlock has always been about solving mysteries, and the ones hes got here are exactly the sort of thing you want to read (er, play) from beginning to end. It may take some time to explore every possible avenue and ensure youve found the right solution, but so what? Solving mysteries should be about having patience and taking Holmes precept of when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth to heart. This is a game that really wants you to explore and eliminate all those impossible solutions  and sometimes even possible ones  before finally, at long last, you come to the correct answer.", "date": "October 20, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
