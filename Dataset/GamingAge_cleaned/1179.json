{"name": "APICO", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/07/apico-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "The more I play APICO, the more convinced I feel that Im playing it wrong. It calls itself a laid-back beekeeping sim game about breeding, collecting, & conserving bees. The Steam reviews are overwhelmingly positive, praising it for being calm and relaxing. And meall I can think whenever I play is how stressed it makes me.In my defence, the distance between APICO and survival games isnt that big. The veneer may be warm and cuddly, but the game still expects you to get into a loop of gathering resources and crafting tools, with a bit of time added here and there for expanding your bee colony and breeding new species of bees. The timing isnt over-the-top strict, but if you dont get into the right groove of building frames and extracting honey very quickly, youll soon find yourself devoting lots of extra time to more and more chores.Part of the problem, I suspect, is the method through which APICO teaches you how to play. Its the sort of game that gives you screen after screen of explanation, and it subscribes to a learn by reading approach, rather than learn by doing. While much of the game will seem familiar if youve ever played any number of those survival or building games  which makes sense, since APICOs genesis was inspired by a Minecraft beekeeping mod  theres still a bit of a learning curve here as you figure out everything the game wants you to do. Given that its asking you to do a lot at every given moment, that means theres a lot to learn.To the games credit, of course: it really does try to be the laidback beekeeping sim that it promises. It plops you down in a port town where everyone is really friendly, and it gives you a seemingly endless amount of resources to achieve the many goals it gives you. Plus the game is promising to give a portion of profits to beekeeping charities, which is unquestionably needed and necessary.So I feel like a churl saying the game doesnt do anything for me. Saying you dont like APICO feels almost as bad as saying you dont like puppies or kittens (for the record: Im pro-puppy and pro-kitten!). Its clearly a game worth investigating if youre fond of farming sims that ask you to keep lots of plates spinning at any given moment. But truthfully, it doesnt do anything for me.", "date": "July 26, 2022", "grade": "B"}
