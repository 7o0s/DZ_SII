It has some serious competition from the PS3 version of Planet 51 (sample mission: you mow the lawn), but at least that had the excuse of being a cash-in for a kids movie. Die!Die!Die! was made just for the PS Vita, and itzzzzzsorry, I nodded off for a second there.I mean, I didnt right at that moment (obviously), but I really did fall asleep playing the game. And not just once, either; it happened to me twice, and one of those times was right in the middle of the afternoon. That should tell you all you need to know about Die!Die!Die!Still need to know more? Well fine, how about this: Die!Die!Die! bills itself as the Vitas first medical defence game. That, apparently, is code for tower defense with one tower that never moves. All you do is aim at and shoot germs for the whole game. The enemies change a little bit, but apart from the final stages, theyre all killed in the same way. And even in that final stage, all you have to do is colour coordinate your shots  its not as if you need to plan or strategize anything. Occasionally the invading germs move a little faster, but never so quickly that you seriously need to worry about doing a level over again. This is a game where everything you need to know, you can figure out in the first few seconds. And then you get to do that same thing over, and over, and over, and over, and ovzzzzwhoops, sorry again.There are a few twists, I guess, if you want to call them that. The game randomly throws power-ups on the screen, but its up to you to figure out how to pick them up and what they do  though, in the interest of fairness, Ill note that it doesnt take enormous amounts of brainpower to figure out you pick them up by touching them. In any case, its not as if theyre hugely necessary in the vast majority of the levels  since, again, the only thing you have to do in this game is aim and shoot. On a different note, the game also includes a survival mode. The survival mode is the exact same thing as the campaign mode, except it doesnt have any kill or time limits, so it just goes on forever, in case youre a masochist and you want to prolong the agony experience of Die!Die!Die. Its endless waves of germs, floating across the screen in the same path, in the same direction, with the same background. My eyes are getting heavy just thinking about it.If youre looking for positiveswell, keep looking. The music isnt just grating, its also repetitive. The visuals are kind of colorful, but they inhabit some weird space between cute and gross thats best classified as straight-up ugly. And to top it all off, Die!Die!Die! is $5; while that may be the PSN equivalent of a 99 cent mobile game, its still $4 more than an actual 99 cent mobile game  and, lets face it, there are loads of cheap and free mobile games that are more interesting and have more content than Die!Die!Die!", "date": "October 15, 2013", "grade": "D-"}
