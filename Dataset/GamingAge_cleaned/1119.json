{"name": "Stranger of Sword City", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/05/stranger-sword-city-review-ps-vita-xbox-one/", "text": "Theres a simple test to determine whether youre going to like Stranger of Sword City: do you like dungeon crawling? I mean, do you really, really, really like dungeon crawling? If you do, then odds are very good that youre going to love this too.After all, youll be doing a lot of that here. In fact, youll be doing little else. And when youre not grinding your way through labyrinthine dungeons, youre getting ready to go back into them, whether youre managing your party, buying new weapons, getting party members healed, or chatting with various characters about gossip related to the dungeons and your party. This game is nothing if not very focused on what it wants you to do.As you can probably guess from the tone of this review so far, Im not a huge fan of dungeon crawling  at least not to the extent this game calls for. Im fine with a bit of it in certain doses (say, however much you want to say Severed had), but Stranger in Sword City takes it far beyond anything I can stand.In particular, I found the way the game handled healing and resurrection to be pretty infuriating. Youre given a party of six members to start, but you cant earn new people until youve progressed to a certain point in the game. Unfortunately, that requires some grinding. Which also means, inevitably, losing one or two party members to injury. That, in turn, means that you have to grind through dungeons with a smaller party until they get better in order for time to properly progressexcept with a smaller party, the damage becomes more concentrated. In other words, it kind of creates a feedback loop that can only be solved by  you guessed it  more grinding it it out.All of thats not to say, however, that I cant appreciate some of its better qualities. The combat is pretty straightforward, and if youre into party management, you have plenty of options here. More impressively, the story and graphics are mature in a good way. Whereas the developers previous game, Demon Gaze, went pretty heavy on the fan service, Stranger of Sword City is a tale about death and the afterlife, and it has a sombre art style to match. I wouldnt go so far as to call it gorgeous, but its certainly much more visually interesting than many of its peers (and theres relatively little boob armor to boot).", "date": "May 13, 2016", "grade": "B"}
