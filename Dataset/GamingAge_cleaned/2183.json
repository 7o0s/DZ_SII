{"name": "New Super Mario Bros. U", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/11/new-super-mario-bros-u-review-for-wii-u/", "text": "Like some folks, I was a bit disappointed in Nintendos efforts with New Super Mario Bros. 2 on the 3DS. Its lack of any real difficulty kept it from being a standout 2D Mario adventure, and while there was some decent level design, and an interesting hook behind it with the whole coin collecting extravaganza, its the first, core Mario title that I can remember feeling a little let down by. It was still fun, sure, but not quite what weve come to expect from Nintendo and their mascot.So Im happy to say that I think New Super Mario Bros. U on the Wii U manages to turn that around quite a bit. Its not a flawless 2D platformer, after all, theres still some reason Nintendo keeps recycling that less than stellar soundtrack, but overall this is definitely a step up from NSMB2, and might be the best of the New series style of games so far.Most of the elements youd expect to see in a 2D Mario game are still in place here. Bowser is up to no good, the Princess is in trouble, and its up to Mario, Luigi, and two Toads to save the Mushroom Kingdom. Theres little emphasis on story or set-up outside of a humorous opening cinematic, and once thats out of the way youre ready to delve into the eight different worlds on display in New Super Mario Bros. U.As Mario, or one of the other three characters if youre playing through local co-op, youll leap, smash, and stomp your way through a variety of stages themed around familiar settings for the series. Mainstays like desert worlds, poison lakes, giant settings, and underwater lairs are all present here, but with enough design changes to stand out from what has come before. Take the Soda Jungle setting for instance, which midway through turns into a haunted experience filled with Boos and wonderfully painted backgrounds that add to the oppressive and dangerous nature of the world around you. Theres some fun departures scattered about the eight different worlds, and while it might seem a bit same-y at first glance, playing through the levels reveals a number of new elements.Theres still an element of ease present in New Super Mario Bros. U, after all, extra lives are still in abundance. But at about the midway point youll find that you start to burn through that high life count a little more often, as the challenge manages to ratchet up in a way that the New series hasnt really seen before. Even more so than New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which for me was sort of the landmark, challenging game in the series up to this point. Of course, this becomes even more pronounced if youre at all into chasing down the three hidden star coins in each stage, and seeking out hidden exits thatll lead to new stages (and occasionally new worlds).Worth mentioning as well, New Super Mario Bros. U seems to take a whole lot of influence from Super Mario World on the SNES. There are a handful of enemies clearly pulled from that universe, along with an overworld, connected map thats very reminiscent of SMW. Theres also some neat elements present in that overworld map, including different points where youre able to actually choose the next world to visit, as opposed to being forced along a particular path. There are even a couple points that pretty much force you to look for alternate exits in worlds in order to advance, requiring just a tad more effort than youll typically find in a modern 2D Mario game.For new elements theres not a lot else introduced here, outside of one new suit called the Squirrel Suit, and the addition of Baby Yoshi. The Squirrel Suit takes familiar elements found in the cape in SMW, the Tanooki Suit in Super Mario Bros. 3, and the Propeller Suit of New Super Mario Bros. Wii, allowing some limited flight but without feeling grossly overpowered. You cant simply fly high above a stage and complete it, but are limited to one boosted mid-air jump and the ability to flutter down slowly to safety. Theres an added element here that allows you to grip to walls, which can assist you a bit in reaching difficult spots and star coin locations, but as far as flight power-ups go, this is certainly the most balanced one weve seen.However, if youre interested in something new from your 2D Mario experience, youll need to look no further than the new Challenge and Boost Rush modes found in New Super Mario Bros. U. Challenge mode provides a series of themed challenges, like Time Attack which gives you three medal goal times to clear in either truncated or altered versions of single player stages. Theres other challenges to tackle as well, including ones involving the Squirrel Suit which task you with never touching the ground before hitting the end of level flag, or an interesting 1-Up themed event that has you bouncing off enemies in an effort to score as many extra lives as possible before hitting the ground.Boost Rush mode incorporates the new Game Pad from the Wii U, and gives you timed event courses that require one player to lay down colored platforms via the Game Pad while the other player runs through the course with a Wii U remote. This provides one of the most frantic and fun experiences Ive had with the game, and will really tax the ability of both players involved. I sort of liken it to those infamous trust exercises you always see in TV and film, where one person needs to fall backwards into the arms of another. In order to do well at Boost Rush you essentially need to commit to jumps that would typically result in your death, and trust that your partner will be able to plan your trajectory with well-placed platforms that allow you to continue on to the end of the stage. Its very difficult, but also very rewarding to pull off.", "date": "November 26, 2012", "grade": "A-"}
