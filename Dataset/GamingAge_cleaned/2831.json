Right off the bat, youre welcomed to the opening menu by pop-punk that simultaneously manages to be incredibly generic and incredibly annoying. Even as someone who loved the genre back in its heyday  and who still has strong nostalgia for the likes of blink-182  I was scrambling for my remote to turn down the music because of how terrible it was. It doesnt get any better once the game actually begins, since youre subjected to the same blaring guitars on repeat. The small mercy here is that at least you dont have to listen to the vocals for the entire game, but the music itself is still lousy enough that I soon decided to just keep it muted, for my sanitys sake. So thats strike one.Strike two is the fact this is a game about college roommates is a school called Liberty University. Theres a real school called Liberty University andwell, its a little controversial. Admittedly, seeing as Roommates is a visual novel/dating sim about pairing one of the main characters off with one of his or her roommates, and that one of the dating options is same-sex, its quite possible that the choice of school name is meant as a big, trolling wink on the part of the developers. While thats kind of admirable on some level  particularly seeing as the developers boast on their main Twitter of having a second, much more NSFW Twitter  it still gives that school much more attention than it deserves.Strike three takes a little while longer to reveal itself, but it quickly becomes clear that Roommates is a pretty abysmal visual novel. The characters are all obnoxious stereotypes  ones artsy, anothers a rocker, ones slutty, and so on  and nothing they do or say makes them remotely interesting. Given that the game is all about directing either the nerdy Anna or the rocker Max to find their loves, and they do that by getting to know their housemates, you can see why thats a bit of an issue.Roommates just also isnt that interesting beyond the story. Visually, the characters are even less interesting than what you usually see in visual novels: they only have couple of facial expressions and poses, and even when the settings change, the expressions and poses stay the same, with the outfits changing occasionally.Even worse, for some reason the developers think that establishing daily routines is a key part of what makes visual novels interesting, so you have to set your characters schedule for each week. Its about as thrilling as youd imagine scheduling would be. On top of that, if you want to see multiple endings, you need to play through the game several times; I can assure you, it gets no more interesting the seventh or eighth time, particularly since nothing changes all that much from one playthrough to the next.To recap: the characters are bad, the story is dull, the visuals are uninteresting, the music is awful, the gameplay is repetitive even by the standards of the genre. Basically, theres nothing good about Roommates, and theres no reason whatsoever to play it.", "date": "November 4, 2020", "grade": "D"}
