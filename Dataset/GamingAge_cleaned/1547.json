{"name": "A World of Keflings", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/12/world-keflings-review-wii-u/", "text": "Ive played A World of Keflings for a not-insubstantial amount of time. Ive helped the little Keflings build their factories and town halls and homes. Ive assigned them their tasks. Ive interacted with them. Ive helped them shoo away dragons. And after all that, all I have to say is: Im bored.I really dont know what else there is to say about such an insubstantial game. What I described above is pretty much the whole thing in a nutshell. You help the little Keflings build up their cities, andthats it. Theres not really any conflict to handle, which in turn means theres not a whole heck of a lot of plot to get through. Its a Real-Time Strategy game where calling it strategy is putting it nicely, a Sim City where theres essentially zero risk. You just build, and delegate, and then build some more.Im almost undoubtedly approaching the game all wrong, of course, expecting it to have things like objectives and story. A World of Keflings clearly isnt designed for that, so complaining about it not being there is kind of missing the point entirely. I suspect  and the positive reviews for the Xbox 360 version would bear this out  that its the sort of game where youre supposed to just revel in the ordinariness of it all. You need to just sit back and relax and enjoy helping these little people build up their world.On top of that, I probably played it the wrong way, choosing to go it alone rather than playing it with a friend. I suppose if I were looking for a pleasantly simple multiplayer game  especially if the other player was someone new to games  then the lack of competition may hold a certain appeal.", "date": "December 24, 2014", "grade": "C-"}
