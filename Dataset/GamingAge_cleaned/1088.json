{"name": "The Technomancer", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/07/technomancer-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "A few years ago, near the end of the last generation, Focus Home Interactive released an action-RPG developed by Spiders called Mars: War Logs. It was thoroughly unimpressive in every respect, and Im quite certain the only reason I remember it is because I played/reviewed it.Fast-forward to present day, and we have The Technomancer. Stop me if this sounds familiar: developed by Spiders and published by Focus Home Interactive, its an action-RPG thats thoroughly unimpressive in every respect, and Im quite certain that if I hadnt reviewed it, I probably wouldnt even remember it existed in a few months, let alone a few years. While The Technomancer may not be a direct sequel to Mars: War Logs, it certainly seems fair to call it a spiritual successor.The good news, such as it is, is that this game is a spiritual successor that shows marked improvement in at least one or two key areas. The Technomancer actually looks like it belongs in this generation. While I dont think anyone is going to be praising it for its realistic worlds or attention to detail (if youve seen one of this games neon-lit cities or dusty vistas, youve seen them all), its possible to look at the graphics here and not cringe, which isnt something that couldve been said about Mars: War Logs.Likewise, its nice to see that The Technomancer features a little more diversity in its cast. Whereas everyone in Mars: War Logs was basically some variant of bald space marine, here the characters represent a broader spectrum of humanity. Admittedly, it still looks like they based all the characters and NPCs on maybe a dozen different templates, but thats still a huge increase over the one character model that had last time out.Beyond that, though, this is pretty much Mars: War Logs with a new coat of paint. The character names tend to be a little too on-the-nose (I found a seller named Goodsman!). The dialogue is heavy on the exposition, but light on resembling actual human speech. The map is a confusing mess. The voice acting is appallingly bad.Worst of all, the combat hasnt improved at all since Mars: War Logs. In fact, theres a pretty strong argument to be made the The Technomancer is even worse in this respect. Both games place a heavy emphasis on rolling and dodging, but The Technomancers rolls and dodges feel clunky and awkward  not that they were starting from a particularly smooth place to begin with. No matter how much more true to life this may be, it means youll be spending a lot of fights awkwardly lunging from one spot to another before you jump up and button-mash your way through a limited number of combat animations.", "date": "July 5, 2016", "grade": "D+"}
