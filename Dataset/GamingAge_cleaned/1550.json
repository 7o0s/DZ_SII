I played it for about half an hour, chuckled a few times at the referential humor, and then put it off to the side and never played it again. I had it pegged as a game that was more style than substance, that used retro graphics and all kinds of 80s references as a substitute for being interesting.Now that its back  with that aforementioned DX at the end of its name  Im thinking I may have been a little harsh in my initial assessment. Yes, it goes heavy on the retro and yes, you can spend a good chunk of it playing Spot the 80s reference!. But beneath all that, its actually really addictive. Every mission seems to lead naturally into the next, and it doesnt hurt in this regard that as soon as youve finished one mission, there are literally flashing arrows directing you to your next stop. That makes it incredibly hard to ever put the game down, and more often than not, this meant that Id find myself playing for far longer than Id originally intended.That said, what really hooked me this time around was everything you could do between missions. You wouldnt think that an 8-bit game could be that expansive, butwell, it is. Retro City Rampage DXs city is huge, with all kinds of neat side missions and distinct districts to explore. Even more importantly, though, its a well-populated city, which means that not only is there always the possibility of discovering more, theres also plenty of opportunity to indulge your inner psychopath and drive around like a maniac. In fact, its practically encouraged, in a way that would never fly in more realistic (or, at least, more graphically advanced) games like GTA or Saints Row: you get points for the number of pedestrians you can mow down one after another. Its horribly amoral, but its also pretty fun, particularly once you factor in the fact that your vehicles are always significantly more powerful than the cops who will instantly jump out of the cars and start chasing you, guns drawn.Of course, it could be argued that all this non-stop action is just there to distract you from a lack of substance. And while I dont think Id phrase it quite so harshly, I wouldnt not say that, either. Retro City Rampage DX is designed to be a fun, winking nod to 80s action movies and games, but I dont get the sense that said winking is intended to go any deeper than LOL 80s!.", "date": "December 22, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
