{"name": "I and Me", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/04/i-and-me-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "I cant imagine anyone having particularly strong feelings about I and Me.To some extent, this may be by design. I and Me is a puzzle-platformer, but its just about the most gentle, calming puzzle-platformer imaginable. The graphics are fuzzy and dreamlike. The music is of the soft, tinkly piano variety. Even though failing a level is always possible, the fact you can always see a hint/playthrough at any time with one click of a button reduces the challenge level quite a bit. While the contemplative quotes at the beginning of every level are probably intended to make the game feel a little more cerebral, in practice they give the whole thing an ephemeral feel, as if the game is drifting by like a few fleeting thoughts.Of course, its not a long trip from ephemeral to insubstantial, and its also not too long before thats exactly how Id describe I and Me. Theres a bit of a challenge to be found in guiding the two cats to their, er, picture frames (boxes? Wooden carriers?), but stretched out across 90+ levels the novelty wears off well before the end. The game does its best to mix things up a little by throwing in bouncy sheep and lethal hedgehogs and spikes and whatnot, but the levels still all blend together after a not-too-long while, and few of them are that difficult.But Ill hasten to add that nothing in I and Me blends together in a way that stands out as particularly bad. As I said up top, the game feels too light and fluffy for that. Its a pleasant enough experience that even if you do pick it up, you probably wont regret it, but if you remember it for more than a few fleeting moments after finishing it, Id be shocked.", "date": "April 19, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
