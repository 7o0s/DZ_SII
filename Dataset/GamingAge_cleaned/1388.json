{"name": "Omega Quintet", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/07/omega-quintet-review-for-ps4/", "text": "Until a few days ago, I wouldve said that the most boring game Ive ever played was Planet 51, a terrible licensed PS3 game built around some now-forgotten kids movie. How dull was it? Let me put it this way: one of the missions was you cutting grass for about ten minutes. That proved to be one of the games most memorable moments.I mention this in the context of Omega Quintet because, as youve probably guessed, its a strong contender for that crown. While it may not ask you to deliver any newspapers or cut any lawns, it more than makes up for that with more exposition and explanation than you can possibly imagine. Every time you go anywhere or do anything, youre immediately greeted with page after page after page of seemingly endless talking. Trigger an event, and you get screen after screen telling you how everything works. Its possible I may have dreamed this, but I swear at one point there was even a help screen about how to use the help screens.Of course, all the text wouldnt be so bad if what it was conveying was actually interesting. If Omega Quintet had any of the Atelier series charming earnestness, or the surprising wit on the Hyperdimension Neptunia games, it might feel like it was worth it to scroll through screen after screen. Instead, its all just mindless teenage prattle, and it wont take long until you automatically hit the fast-forward button every time a new event begins.For the most part, the gameplay is just as bad. You go into dungeons (or suspiciously dungeon-like fields), you wander around and you kill X number of enemies via turn-based combat, and then you return to the base, report on your progress, and accept new missions. If youve ever played a JRPG before in your life, youve pretty much experienced everything Omega Quintet has to offer.Or, at least, youve almost experienced it all. Because even though nearly everything else in this game is about as standard-issue as JRPGs get, theres still one wrinkle Omega Quintet adds to the equation that sort of sets it apart. See, its described as a JRPG-slash-idol simulator hybrid, and that slash makes a world of difference. In between the boring missions and the boring dialogue, you get to take advantage of the games Promotion Video System and indulge your inner music video director.Yes, you read that correctly. The games focus, after all, is on the Verse Maidens, a pop idol group that just so happens to also be the worlds last line of defense against invading monsters. Obviously, unless youre a massive fan of awful dialogue, you dont want to endure their adventures or the adventures of their hardcore fans, but you just might be up for creating their music videos. I mean, its all J-Pop, so your interest in that aspect of the game may be dictated in part by how much you like the music, but seeing as the rest of Omega Quintet is awfully dull and this one aspect is actually kind of neat, it may hold some appeal even if youre not a fan of the genre.", "date": "July 20, 2015", "grade": "C-"}
