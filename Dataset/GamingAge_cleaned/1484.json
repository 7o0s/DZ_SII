{"name": "Flame Over", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/03/flame-over-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Based on the reaction Flame Over has been getting  both critically and in the broader gaming public (at least as represented by NeoGAF and Twitter)  I think its safe to say its an all-or-nothng kind of game: youll either quickly fall in love with it or quickly hate it, with very little ground in between.Id really like to say that I fall in the former group, that Im ready to declare 2015 the year in which a firefighting roguelike (more on what that actually is in a second) captured my heart, but, quite frankly, I just cant. I dont want to say that I hate it, but if I had to pick one side or the otherwell, lets just say I cant imagine myself penning odes to it any time soon.In my (and the games) defence, Im pretty sure the reason I dislike Flame Over  that is, its insane level of difficulty  is the very same reason so many people are over the moon about it. People like to be challenged, and I get that. The thing is, though, the challenge Flame Over poses to players seems to be far greater than any other game I can think of. And I say that without any sense of hyperbole or exaggeration. This isnt like La-Mulana EX, where you can gradually make incremental improvements with the help of a walkthrough and trial and error. Nor is it like Dark Souls, where, again, trial and error goes a long way towards helping you improve. Its not even like an especially challenging RPG, where you grind and grind until you get enough XP to level up.No, Flame Over is unlike all those games in that it actively works to stop you from improving. For starters, youre playing as a firefighter making his way through randomly-generated dungeons offices, so you cant exactly try to memorize the right path through the burning buildings to rescue all the people and cats that need your help. Theyre in different places each time, and the only way to save them is to search each room, fight back the flames, and escort them back through the other rooms and hallways until theyre free. Seeing as flames can sometimes return to rooms that previously looked safe, you can imagine the whole setup poses a bit of a challenge.Of course, this isnt a big deal by itself. Its tough, sure, but people have been playing roguelikes since the dawn of gaming, and theyve always found ways to get better at them. Just because Flame Over is a pyroguelike it shouldnt be immune to that general rule.But when you add in other things, then you see why its so hard. Things like the controls, and the fact the game doesnt tell you what they are. Sure, youll learn by pressing buttons until stuff happens, and it doesnt take that long to figure out, but considering youre facing a time limit and pretty aggressive flames, the game has a built-in way of stressing you out as you mash buttons.Not only that, it has a built-in way of making it insanely hard to upgrade your character. See, eventually youll piece together that the only way to improve is with better equipment and skills  not a revolutionary idea, obviously. But the only way to get those things is with power-ups, and those are substantially harder to get. Ignore all those coins you earn fighting back flames; theyre largely useless. You need to find power-ups, and those are hidden in offices with particularly flammable items, and can be revealed only if you rescue a person in the room who refuses to do anything to save themselves until the room is free of fire. Then theyll give you a power-upand if you earn enough of those, eventually you get to upgrade one small, specific aspect of main character Blaze Carruthers. The logic here seems kind of circular to me  how do you get better? With power-ups. How do you get power-ups? By getting better.  and honestly, it what really makes me never want to play the game again.", "date": "March 18, 2015", "grade": "B"}
