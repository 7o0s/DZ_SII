After all, its a Switch port of a 2014 dating sim mobile game, and its based on Kitty Powers, the drag queen alter ego of one of the founders of game developer Magic Notion. Needless to say, youve got to have a healthy appetite for camp if youre going to enjoy it. I didnt think I did  and yet, I cant stop playing it.The game is built around your management of a dating agency, with the eponymous Kitty stopping by every so often to give you advice. Youre given clients and a black book of potential love interests, and its up to you to match them together based on their interests and their personality types. They then go on a date, where you have to help your clients navigate through the evenings conversations, while also dealing with whatever unforeseen issues may arise.The matching aspect of the game is pretty fun. Sure, the interests start getting a little repetitive, and theres probably something bad about how the game rewards you for changing your clients appearances to meet the preferences of their potential matches, but, at the end of the day, it was always fun to look beyond physical preferences and figure out who was really compatible.The dates were also fun, but a little more hit or miss. While the conversations were generally enjoyable, the unforeseen issues led to minigames that usually relied way too much on luck. For example, your date would show you a movie poster, and youd have to guess their favourite actor, with nothing obvious to guide you. Likewise, at one point after eating you have to hold in some gas, but you do so by playing a card game where you have to guess whether the next card would be higher or lower. Maybe I just had a horrific run of luck, but the number of times in which I drew a 5, guessed lower, and wound up with a 2 or a 3 seemed highly improbable. I understand that the developers wanted to mix things up a little beyond the basics of a date, but it all felt oddly tacked-on.Given its mobile origins, you wont be shocked to learn that its pretty obvious where Kitty Powers Matchmaker Deluxe originally featured microtransactions. Coins are a huge part of this game, in everything from buying new restaurants and salon treatments for your clients, to giving your luck a little nudge in all those minigames. Thankfully, however, the game isnt stingy with doling out coins, so its never a huge deal  though I imagine it was a much bigger part of the original mobile game.That doesnt take anything away from the Switch version of Kitty Powers Matchmaker Deluxe, though. As I said, its highly addictive thanks to how quickly those dates breeze along, and even if its all done with a wink, the game never seems like its looking down on the genre (which, Ill admit, I may have been doing going into it). It all makes for a fun way to pass the time, and if youre looking for something a little different on the Switch, youll find it right here.", "date": "April 30, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
