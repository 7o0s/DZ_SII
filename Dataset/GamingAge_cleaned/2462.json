Its all about teens thrown together in a post-apocalyptic world who then turn on each other in increasingly vicious ways as they strive to survive.So, naturally, the latest game in the series, Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp, is a board game that puts all the characters from the series into skimpy swimsuits and sticks them in highly repetitive turn-based battles and forgettable interactions with other characters. Also, it basically requires you to spend a bunch of real money on in-game purchases if you want to accomplish anything. As you can probably tell from the tone of the last few sentences, Im not a fan.Its not that I have any inherent objections to the board game-ification of Danganronpa. Im a huge fan of the series, but I wont pretend its some holy, unalterable text. For example, while the board game idea is a little out of nowhere, its not the worst idea ever. Theres precedent for sticking video game characters into board games, whether were talking Mario Party or Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy characters in a Japanese version of Monopoly, to say nothing of the many licensed board games that borrow from video game universes. So Im not going to pretend that Danganronpa is a bridge too far for such games.Likewise, Im not going to object too much to the skimpy swimsuits aspect of the game, either. Its undeniably creepy and fanservice-y, but theres always been that subtext in the games, so bringing it out in the open isnt coming from out of nowhere. Further, the swimsuits arent as prominent in the game as you might expect  they feature in some long, dull cutscenes here and there, but its not like theyre the overarching focus of the game.Rather, my main issue with Danganronpa S is purely with how boring the game is. You simply pick a character, have them go all over a huge board getting into the same turn-based battles and triggering the same encounters over and over again, and dont really get any of the real Danganronpa experience  save for the Monokubs shouting at you every ten turns or so. You do all you can for fifty-two turns, then the game ends, and thats about it.In theory, of course, youre building up characters to try out the Despair Tower mode  but honestly, I have no idea why youd want to, since thats just seemingly endless turn-based battles and nothing else. At least the board game portion of the game is broken up with the cutscenes (which, again, are painfully dull).In the end, all it leads to is grinding for grindings sake, as you try to level up your character as much as possible. You can skip through that if you want to  but thats where the in-game transactions come into effect. Basically your options are spend a tonne of cash to make your characters get better at a pointless battle mode, or sink dozens of hours to grind your characters into something decentso they can be better at a pointless battle mode.Really, theres no incentive either way, as far as Im concerned. As much as Ive always liked the Danganronpa series, I cant imagine wanting to sink endless amounts of time or money into such an empty, boring game. And given were talking about a series for which the word boring should never apply, that should tell you how much of a failure this game is.", "date": "December 22, 2021", "grade": "D"}
