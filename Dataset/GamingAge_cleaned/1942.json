{"name": "KickBeat", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/09/kickbeat-review-ps-vita-psn/", "text": "I really want to love KickBeat. I mean, I think the idea behind it is fantastic. As someone whos generally pretty bad at fighting games, theres something delightfully refreshing about a game where you can kick away wave after wave of enemies just by hitting buttons in time with a songs beat. Whats more, when it works, the game is awesome; I challenge anyone to do a perfect section and not come away feeling like some insane combination of rock star and ninja.Unfortunately, moments like those happen far too infrequently. More often, theres a sizeable gap between KickBeats ideas and their execution. Like, just at a basic level: maybe Im just far less rhythmic than I thought, but it seemed like there were often points where a songs button prompts didnt match its beat. Considering thats the whole point of a game, thats problematic. Similarly, there were several points at which it was hard to tell the order in which the buttons needed to be pressed  again, no small thing, since thats the whole point of the game.Other issues are a little less problematic. Graphically, the games not great, but it does the job; all you really need is animations of ninjas getting kicked, basically, and what story the game has is told (rather well, I might add) via comic-style cutscenes. As for the musicah, the music.Listen, I like to think that my ten-plus years as a music critic in a previous life gave me the ability to appreciate all kinds of music, regardless of genre. I like to approach everything with an open mind. But I have to say this about KickBeat: all the music here sounds the same, and its almost all terrible. On one level, I appreciate this is a subjective thing, and that you might think differently if youre someone who looks back with fondness to late 90s/early 2000s nu-metal. But on another, more objective levelyoure wrong. I mean, Papa Roach? P.O.D.? Innumerable interchangeable bands that sound like Linkin Park clones? I get that KickBeats developers wanted music with big, obvious beats  and all the songs here have those  but its still a shame that at no point did Zen Studios listen to their game and think that a little variety may have helped. There may have been a little sonic dissonance created by putting Top-40 pop alongside Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson, but in the long run, it wouldve been a vast improvement.There is an upside, however: KickBeat includes a music analyzer that allows you to import your music collection and share tracks with other players around the world. At the time of this writing, you need to beat the game in order to unlock the import mode, but the developer has said that they hope to change that in an update. Once thats done, its not hard to see how promising that could be  and how it could add some much needed diversity to the games sound.", "date": "September 4, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
