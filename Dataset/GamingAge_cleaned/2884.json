{"name": "Borderlands Legendary Collection", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/09/borderlands-legendary-collection-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "After playing the three games that comprise the Borderlands Legendary Collection, Ive come to a conclusion: I dont think I like Borderlands.Dont get me wrong, I dont hate the series, either. Ive certainly played these games on enough platforms  including the Vita!  that Ive got a good idea of what to expect when I boot one of them up, and in the right circumstances (i.e. when I feel like doing a bunch of shooting and looting), theyre perfectly fine.The thing is  as this Collection makes abundantly clear  theyre all kind of the same. As I played both Borderlands and Borderlands 2, I realized I had mixed them up pretty thoroughly in my memories, since so much of what you do is the same. This is possibly my first time playing Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, but it says a lot that even after sinking a fair amount of time into it, I cant quite recall if I have memories of playing The Pre-Sequel or memories of playing one of the other games in the series.To be fair, you could just as easily flip that on its head: the good thing about the Borderlands series is that its consistent. Over the course of dozens and dozens and dozens of hours, the game achieves a pretty consistent level of quality. If you want to shoot up tonnes and tonnes of interchangeable bad guys, these are your games, and if you want to collect more loot  guns, money, ammo, health backs, what have you  than you can possibly imagine, you can do that here, too. The quantity of each seems to increase in each new game, so you wouldnt be able to accuse the games of resting on their laurels, at least on that front.Whats more, the games have always been pretty visually striking. The cel-shaded comic book style is done to perfection in each of these games, and it adds to the over-the-top, cartoon-y atmosphere Borderlands goes for. Part of the reason I mix all these games up in my head is because they all look so wonderful, and they shouldnt be penalized for having an aesthetic and sticking to it.The Legendary Collection also performs pretty well from a technical perspective. I wouldnt have thought this would be a concern  Borderlands 2 ran on the Vita, after all, even if there were a couple of hiccups here and there  but seeing as the pretty much identical Handsome Collection apparently had some issues, I guess its worth noting that the games here all run pretty smoothly, with no noticeable glitches or problems.", "date": "September 8, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
