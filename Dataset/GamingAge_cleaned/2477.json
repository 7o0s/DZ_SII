While it certainly has some issues, as my colleague Dustin noted six years ago when the game was first released, on the whole my way of thinking is closer to Bennys: that if youre in the mood for a zombie game with a lot of engaging content, this is it.As such, it should come as no surprise that theres a lot of game to be found in Dying Light: Platinum Edition now that its on the Switch. You get the original base game, plus all the DLC  including both The Following, which was practically a game unto itself, as well as Be The Zombie, whichhonestly, isnt as good, but still a fun little diversion. Given that were talking about a pretty decent game, if youre in the mood for horror, thats a solid package.That said, as good  or, arguably, as great  as the content is, Dying Light: Platinum Edition isnt without some issues. And, unsurprisingly, virtually all of those issues come down to the games performance.This is probably not a huge surprise to anyone. I mean, as much as I love my Switch, I dont think Id call it a graphical powerhouse (unless were talking first-party games). Consequently, you probably wont be shocked to hear that Dying Light doesnt look so great here.In fact, thats probably understating things. It looks mostly passable when theres not much action happening on the screen  though even when my character was simply walking down a mostly deserted street, there was still lots and lots of the environment popping into existence as he walked. As for when things got a little busier or a little more chaotic, it wasnt a pretty sight. The game struggled when it had to render lots of zombies all at once. Seeing as were talking about a game set in a world overrun by zombieswell, you probably get the picture.Whatever other issues there are here come down to personal preference. For example, the combat here is awfully repetitive, since youre usually just armed with a pipe (or some other blunt instrument), and you just whack away at whatever zombies get nearby. At the same time, however, viewing Dying Light as a game where combat matters probably does it a disservice  this is a survival horror game, after all, and the game basically wants you to run away from zombies, not straight into them.And from that perspective, Dying Light: Platinum Edition, with its lengthy playtime and tonnes of DLC, gives you ample opportunity to do that. There arent really any other games like this on the Switch, so as long as youre okay with  or at least willing to tolerate  visuals that pale in comparison to how they look elsewhere, then youre in for one of the last gens best zombie games.", "date": "December 2, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
