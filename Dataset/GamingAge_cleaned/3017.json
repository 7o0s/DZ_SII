{"name": "Reed Remastered", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/04/reed-remastered-review-for-ps4-ps-vita-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Reed Remastered is kind of deceptive. It has a lot of the features you might associate with twitch platformers: the levels are all short, you die constantly, and there are flashing lights and pulsing sounds that make you feel like you should be trying to speedrun your way through every level.Yet putting Reed Remastered in the same category as, say, Super Meat Boy would be a big mistake  and not just because its not nearly as good. Rather, you learn early on  after the single enemy is introduced, but before every level starts featuring the constant threat of whirring blades  that its actually a fairly traditional platformer, one that rewards taking your time and carefully planning out all your moves. If you just jump from ledge to ledge, youre going to die, and youre going to die regularly enough thatwell, that you may start thinking that it does belong in the same category as a game like SMB.Thats not to say Reed Remastered doesnt expect players to have their reflexes working. There are plenty of tricky jumps that you have to time just right. Its just that, more often than not, youre better off waiting a moment. It may feel like youre racing against the clock, but if you look closely (or, I guess, if you take a second to look at all), you realize theres no clock here to be found.Other than the fact it looks like a twitch platformer but its not, theres not really anything particularly noteworthy about Reed Remastered. Its got the de rigeur retro graphics, albeit ones that are more 16-bit era than 8-bit. Theres no story to speak of, beyond some intro bit with a computer that never gets referenced again. The main character looks like a cat, so I guess it has that going for it. But on the whole, it doesnt do anything thatll stick with you for any longer than the short time itll take you to beat the game.Of course, there are worse things in the world than solidly unremarkable platformers, so from that perspective, I cant say I disliked Reed Remastered. Its a decent enough game that improves a little when you realize that its not actively trying to kill you at every opportunity. Not exactly the stuff of eventual GOTY material or anything, but Ive definitely played worse.", "date": "April 7, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
