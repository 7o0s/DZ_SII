I mean, its Trivial Pursuit. The game has been around for more than 40 years. Even Trivial Pursuit Live! first came out more than seven years ago. At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of whether or not youre going to like it.Mind you, theres a lot to be said for video game adaptations of board games that dont get in their own way. Its certainly easy enough to screw up, so Trivial Pursuit Live! 2 deserves some praise for simply sticking with what makes it fun. This was one of the strengths of the first Trivial Pursuit Live!, and its still one of the games strengths today.Which is to say: if you like trivia, youll find plenty here to enjoy. You have your pick up three- or five-round games, both of which have enough difference between the rounds that you never feel like youre just doing the same thing over and over again. Moreover, the AI is just balanced enough that the game feels like a challenge without being too hard. Slap on some slightly shinier graphics than last time out, and you can see why it can make for an enjoyable time.Obviously, Trivial Pursuit Live! 2 didnt reinvent the wheel. As I wrote up top, its exactly what youd expect from a Trivial Pursuit game. But when youve got a game thats as reliable as Trivial Pursuit, sometimes thats enough. Trivial Pursuit Live! 2 wont wow you with innovation, but it still makes for a fun way to spend a half hour.", "date": "March 31, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
