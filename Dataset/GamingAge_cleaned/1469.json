Maybe its a cultural thing, maybe Ive just played terrible examples of the genre  whatever it is, they just dont do anything for me.As nice as it would be to say that Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters is the game that changed my mindwell, its not. Going strictly by the visual novel elements of the game, its probably worse than what Ive come to expect. Not only that, the one major departure from visual novels  the ghost-hunting boardgame that acts the climax for each chapter  falls a little flat. So all in all, if youre looking for the game that will get you into visual novels, this probably isnt it.Its possible, of course, that Im drastically underestimating other peoples enjoyment of ghost hunting. After all, Ive always been a little iffy on tactical, turn-based action, and that  more or less  is what it is. Think of it as a supernatural version of Battleship: you move your ghosthunters around on a grid, hoping that eventually youll run into the ghosts and be able to attack them before they can attack you. If you like the randomness of Battleship, obviously, then that might bode well for your enjoyment of this game, but as someone who never went crazy for that game, I didnt like it much more here, no matter how many ghosts it may add to the equation.And even if the words supernatural version of Battleship do set your heart aflutter, youve still got to deal with the fact everything surrounding those boardgames kind of sucks. Visually, the presentation is incredibly forgettable, all static pictures with characters zooming on and off screen. While this is pretty standard, and some characters (particularly the ghosts) look kind of cool, the fact all the locations look like real-world pictures just thrown on screen makes it kind of cheap-looking. Contrast that with a game like XBlaze: Code Embryo, where the backgrounds all look like they belong in the colorful Blazblue universe, and you can see why it seems kind of lackluster.As for the story itself, its pretty much exactly what youd expect from the games title: a bunch of high school students running around Tokyo hunting ghosts. Some of the chapters are more interesting and engaging than others, but on the whole, I cant imagine theres much here that will stick with anyone after the game is done.", "date": "April 3, 2015", "grade": "C-"}
