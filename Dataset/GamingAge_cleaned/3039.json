I mean, youre basically playing with toy trains. Even if you never had train tracks as a kid  and I dont think I did  it seems like one of those things that should be so intuitive that its practically second nature.That Mini Trains isnt comes down to a combination of awkward controls and lousy explanations. It doesnt always take the time to tell you what youre doing, which means youll spend some time just trying to figure out how it works. Whats more, even after you know what youre doing, you still have to contend with a camera thats functionally useless  which is kind of a big deal when were talking about a puzzle game where you need to rotate the board to see how to lay things out properly.Mini Trains also has a scoring system that makes no sense whatsoever. It awards you points for finishing a level, but they dont seem to be based on anything, since a) theres no time limit, and b) you have to collect every star in a level before its considered finished. It was always kind of baffling any time I didnt get three stars for a level, because there doesnt seem to be any actual difference between a two-star run and a three-star run.All of this is to say: this game couldve been good if it just stopped getting in its own way. Given that toy trains have been around a century, I wouldve guessed that it wouldnt be too hard to translate the experience to a video game. And yet, Mini Trains would suggest otherwise.", "date": "March 16, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
