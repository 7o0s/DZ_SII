{"name": "Actual Sunlight", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/actual-sunlight-review-for-ps-vita-pc/", "text": "Before I write anything else about Actual Sunlight, Ill write this: if youre dealing with feelings of chronic depression or suicidal thoughts, there are people willing to listen and to help, wherever you are. I know thats kind of a trite thing to say, but in the context of this game, it seems like the most appropriate thing, too.Its also the thing I feel most comfortable writing, since beyond that, Im kind of lost. Im fortunate enough to never have had to deal with chronic depression or mental illness. Ive never had to stave off suicidal thoughts. Like most people, Ive had bad things happen to me, but luckily Ive always been able to shake them off and move on with my life; the point of Actual Sunlight, as far as I can tell, is to convey what its like to be someone who cant do that.Ill be frank: it didnt do that for me. Thats not to say the game doesnt do it at all. I have no doubt that some people will play Actual Sunlight and feel a terrifying jolt of recognition as they see their own struggles played out in the text on the screen. Whats more, I hope that some younger people will pick up the game, and feel like creator Will ONeill is speaking directly to them when he breaks the fourth wall about ten minutes into the game, and writes an impassioned plea to not give in to depression, to find a different and better path. And for those people, Im glad the game exists, since anything that helps people deal with their own demons is, I hope, a good thing.But as far as my personal experience goes? I kind of hated it. I feel bad saying that. I know its probably the wrong way to react. But its the honest truth. Every moment I spent reading main character Evan Winters angsty whining was a moment I spent hoping the game would just hurry up and end. That sounds awful, of course, since a grim game like this has only one obvious conclusion (spoiler?). ButI dont know. The more Winter retreated into his own head and the more time he spent obsessively going over all the ways the world sucked, the more I just grew frustrated and annoyed by it all. Again, I realize thats the wrong way to react. But I have to be honest: Ive felt more empathy for the main characters in, say, God of War (where my onscreen avatar was literally a god) or Uncharted (murderous, semi-sociopathic treasure hunter) or Katamari Forever (little dude rolling things up for the King of the Universe) than I did at any point in Actual Sunlight.In my defense, of course, Winter is not a main character thats particularly easy to love. Between his extreme solipsism, his implied alcoholism, his short temper, his rants about the homeless, his general misanthropywell, you get the idea. And to top it all off, as if to drive home just how grating he is, the game accompanies his text-based downward spiral with a metallic screech. If ever a game actively tried to alienate its players, this is it.", "date": "August 14, 2015", "grade": "C"}
