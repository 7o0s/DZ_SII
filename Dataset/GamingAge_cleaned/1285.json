{"name": "Tales from the Borderlands The Vault of the Traveler", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/10/tales-from-the-borderlands-the-vault-of-the-traveler-review-for-pc-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "So its not necessarily surprising that the finale to Telltales Tales from the Borderlands was good, considering the overall quality of the series up to this point. But I was still pretty amazed at how well it wrapped up all the individual threads building up to this fifth and final episode. There was a lot to resolve here, what with Mallory, The Vault, Handsome Jack, Vaughn, and the mysterious stranger guiding Rhys and Fiona through the wilderness of Pandora. However, all of these things are tackled and brought together in a culmination that feels like a fitting end to one of the best Telltale entries to date.From a gameplay perspective this fifth entry of Tales from the Borderlands doesnt deviate much from the last four episodes. Things are still told from the perspective of both Fiona and Rhys, this is still a story/dialogue driven experience, choices are made, QTEs pop-up, and youll have some limited moments to move around different environments. All of this is pretty par for the course in general for Telltale titles, so if youre expecting anything wildly different, well, I dont know why you would at this point.That said, there is one sequence that certainly makes use of the QTEs in an interesting, Street Fighter-esque manner. Its not something to spoiler here, but this sequence is one of the more enjoyable moments in the entirety of Tales from the Borderlands, and one that I imagine will stand out for everyone else playing. Theres also a key moment in this episode where youre able to create a B Team of Vault Hunters put together from characters youve encountered earlier. Choices made when interacting with those characters will determine if theyll join your group, adding a little replay value to the tail end of the adventure, and some noticeable impact for decisions made.", "date": "October 20, 2015", "grade": "A"}
