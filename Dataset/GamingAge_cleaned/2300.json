{"name": "Theatrhythm Final Fantasy", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/07/theatrhythm-final-fantasy-review-for-3ds/", "text": "Ever wonder what youd get if you stripped Elite Beat Agents of the licensed music soundtrack, and replaced it with iconic Final Fantasy arrangements instead? Well, youd get something like Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, releasing this week for the Nintendo 3DS. Not to say that this is a complete rip-off of Nintendos Elite Beat Agents, but it certainly seems to borrow a few familiar elements. To be fair EBA was more of an evolution of old-school rhythm games that proceeded it, like Parappa the Rapper for instance, and in that same vein Theatrhythm builds off of the concept even more, but within the trappings of the Final Fantasy universe.While the core gameplay is all about tapping, swiping, and holding down the stylus to mimic the on-screen prompts that play on the top 3D display, theres a lot of underlying elements cribbed from the standard RPG playbook. These elements come in the form of building a party, taken from the cast of previous Final Fantasy titles, and completing musical tracks in order to gain experience and items. Yes, you can level up your characters in a rhythm game, and thats partly where Theatrhythms surprisingly addictive gameplay shines.Theatrhythms gameplay is divided up into a handful of modes, most of which are found under the Music Stage option of the main menu. Within this area youll have three different play types to check out, including Series, Challenge, and Chaos Shrine. Series is a structured play through of all 13 Final Fantasy titles, dividing up the musical tracks into five stages for each game. Each game gets a bookended opening and closing theme which is completely optional, and is there only to earn additional Rhythmia points, which are tied into various unlocks for the game. The meat of the Series stages consists of one Battle theme, one Field Theme and then an Event theme.Each of these themes is composed of what most fans would label the stand-out tracks from their respective Final Fantasy entry. Final Fantasy 7 sports One-Winged Angel for its Battle theme, and Final Fantasy 6 shows of Terras Theme for walkabout Field music. Theres a ton of musical tracks included, and a lot more planned as optional DLC down the road. Its a great mix of tunes that helps to remind even the most jaded Final Fantasy fan that the series has generally always supported excellent music, and that really shines in Theatrhythm.Prior to beginning the game, youll be tasked with creating a four character party that gives you a selection of main characters from the 13 games. Most of these entries consist of who youd expect to represent their individual titles, so to start with youll get characters like Cloud from Final Fantasy VII, Cecil from Final Fantasy IV, Vaan from Final Fantasy XII and so on. There are more characters that youll eventually unlock, but theres definitely a lot of room for other characters that didnt quite make the cut. There are certainly some disappointing omissions here, but my guess is that theyre just making room for a potential sequel, in the same way the PSP Dissidia titles never fully fleshed out their individual rosters.Your party selection isnt just for show, and come complete with individual stats, strengths, weaknesses, and abilities that will dictate how well you perform in each of the three songs that make up an individual level. Certain characters have higher agility than others, which makes them more ideal for Field music stages, because they can travel farther and might encounter random Moogles or other characters thatll grant you items. Other characters might be stronger, or have better magic, and theyll perform better in the Battle music stages, allowing you to fight more monsters which mean more chances to have random items drops.And gathering items is a pretty important factor here, as theyre often a way of unlocking harder to get skills for your party members. Youll get a lot of one time use items, like potions, and items thatll allow you to use a certain summoning monster in the Battle themes (which is generally random otherwise). But other items you equip will grant you a special skill if their requirements are met, like a level 5 version of Flare, and these seem like the items to chase after. Theres also a set of collectible cards that you can earn, which is actually a pretty neat feature in the game, and comes complete with an in-game binder to hold the cards, multiple ways to view them, flavor text on the back of the cards, and various rarities for each card type.Playing through the Series mode of the Music Stages doesnt prove to be too challenging for anyone thats remotely familiar with this style of game, but the other two modes will definitely put up more of a fight for experienced players. Challenge mode allows you to select single tracks from each game represented, and play through an expert version of the song. If you hit rank A or higher, youll unlock the Ultimate version, which is a tough as nails mode thatll take a lot of practice before youll ever be able to perfect a round.Chaos Shrine, for me at least, proved to be the most interesting of the three modes in the Music Stages. Chaos Shrine tracks are a little harder to get, but youll typically unlock one while playing through Series mode. Completing a Chaos Shrine round will unlock more rounds, but they seem to get progressively harder, and are often as difficult as some of the Ultimate tracks found in Challenge mode. However, Chaos Shrine gives you one random Field music, and random Battle music stage to participate in, and features tracks not found in other two modes. It also tracks the bosses youll fight in the Battle theme stage, and gives you an idea of what items you can expect to see once youve finished the Chaos Shrine for the first time.Chaos Shrines are also tied into Theatrhythms Street Pass function, which is also pretty cool. I havent had a chance to actively try this out yet, but Im really hoping to pick up some hits from random people once the game releases this week. For the Street Pass function, youll create an id card that uses artwork and various backgrounds from the game, a title that you can randomly generate or select, a small phrase, and then a Chaos Shrine that you can attach to your profile. Youll then trade this Chaos Shrine with other people you connect with, and vice versa, providing an interesting method to unlocking more Chaos Shrine events.", "date": "July 2, 2012", "grade": "A"}
