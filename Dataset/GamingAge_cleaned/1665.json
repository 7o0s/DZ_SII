Its a fun, deep game, and I enjoyed my time with it.Im saying this up front because, for a game that I liked, Im having a really easy time thinking of all the things I didnt like about it, and a much harder time saying what, exactly, I liked so much.Take, for example, the whole way SAO:HF presents information to you, the player. Or, to put it more bluntly: this game features lots and lots of massive infodumps. Head into a battle, and you have to click through pages and pages of explanation on what each piece of on-screen information means. Talk to a random character, and youre liable to trigger ten minutes of unskippable dialogue. Walk into a new area, and you trigger an endless cutscene. Throughout Sword Art Online, the developers regularly commit the sin of telling rather than showing, and unless youre already deeply invested in the games characters and their relationships because of prexisting anime fandom, its hard to keep it all straight.In fairness, of course, the infodumps arent wholly useless. If, like me, youre going into Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment without any prior knowledge of the series, theres definitely value in getting an overview of the basic storyline. Similarly, theres a whole lot going on here, so theres certainly an argument to be made that its better to know too much about a games mechanics than too little. I, personally, wouldnt make that argument, but at least I sort of understand where its all coming from.Its a lot harder to sit through those interminable dialogue sequences though  and not just because theyre regularly provided with little indication of who the other people are and why youre talking to them for so long. No, what makes them even harder to take is that they dont look so great. Thats not to say they look bad; indeed, SAO:HFs dialogue scenes look like virtually every other JRPGs dialogue  which is to say, you get people sliding on and off the screen as they say their lines, and you trigger each new line by pressing X (or, in this case, O, since the Japanese controls were kept intact). That, by itself, isnt the worst thing; it makes SAO seem like (insert name of every other recent Vita JRPG here).Rather, what makes those static dialogues hard to take is that the animated cutscenes look so fantastic. When the action switches over to straight-up animation, it feels like youre watching a TV show (or, presumably, the cartoon series on which the show is based). Its a lot easier to get drawn in when youre watching actions unfold, rather than when youre constantly being told to press a button to advance to the next line. I get that animating a whole games worth of cutscenes would call for a budget thats probably unrealistic for a Vita game, but at the same time, those teases of what couldve been are so tantalizing. For that matter, even the non-cutscenes look pretty great  as youre exploring the world of Sword Art Online, youre regularly shown a place thats much more richly fleshed out than most other Vita games of this ilk.And on the topic of exploration, theres another major flaw: the camera controls in this game are occasionally horrendous. While its easy enough to correct a weird perspective when youre running across a field, its pretty much impossible to do that in the middle of a battle. Throughout my time in Sword Art Online, I would regularly find my onscreen character stuck on the other side of a charging enemy. Or, worse, Id find that the camera had suddenly gotten stuck in a fixed position which gave me no context as to where my character was. Needless to say, its difficult to fully appreciate a game when you cant see yourself, or your enemies, or pretty much anything of use to you as a player.Yet, despite all my problems with the game, I still really liked it. The combat is relatively simple and straightforward; where most JRPGs stick to the tried-and-true formula of team- and turn-based combat on an isometric grid, Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment takes a hackier and slashier approach. You still have the option of fighting monsters with a party of teammates, but you get to move a little more freely around wide-open spaces, attacking whatever enemies get in your way in real-time combat.Speaking of moving around wide-open spaces, thats another good thing about Sword Art Online: this is a big, expansive game, both in terms of its physical space (its designed to be a faux-MMO, and it feels like that) and in terms of the story. Presumably because the game is based on a property with its own, fully-developed mythology, this game has a lot going on. Theres literally a universe to explore, and even if the exposition may occasionally go a little overboard, its still great (if a little daunting) to have so much to do.", "date": "August 19, 2014", "grade": "B"}
