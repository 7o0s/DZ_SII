{"name": "Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/11/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-review-ps4/", "text": "Theres not much that Ill add to my existing Assassins Creed IV review from a few weeks back, but if you were holding out for the PS4 version of the game you made a pretty good choice. Even without the recent patch to bring the resolution up from 900p to 1080p, this is clearly a step up both in visuals and framerate from the PS3 version of the game.You still get the great pirate themed, swashbuckling fun found on the PS3, but at a much steadier framerate which manages to hold at 30 frames per second regardless of whats happening on screen. The added resolution, improved textures, and just general improvement in visual fidelity really does Assassins Creed IV a world of good. This was already a game filled with lush environments on land and sea, but with the power of next-gen behind it, everything just pops out more than before.Outside of the improved visuals I also noticed superior load timesat least once the game is fully cached to the hard drive. I also opted to go the upgrade route, using the PS3 copy of the game, and the $10 credit supplied with my PS4 purchase, to download the game directly from the store. This function requires the PS3 game to be in the disc drive, and information is still pulled from the disc for caching, with the actual download from the store clocking in at a little over 4 gigs. The loading feels significantly faster here, with only a few seconds allotted to loading between sequences, action, and cutscenes.The only other addition comes from the touchpad functionality on the DualShock 4. This is used primarily for the map, allowing you to swipe at the pad to move around the map instead of the analog stick. Its honestly not really better or more precise though, and I found myself defaulting to the analog stick more often than not.", "date": "November 24, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
