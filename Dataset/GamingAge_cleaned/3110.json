{"name": "Knowledge Trainer: Trivia", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/01/knowledge-trainer-trivia-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "When I think of exceedingly addictive trivia games, I think of ones that have personality, or some neat hook. Like, the allure of Trivial Pursuit generally crosses over from the board game to the video game, while You Dont Know Jack and the old Buzz series had hosts that made their respective games worth playing. More recently, Its Quiz Time stands out in recent years as a game that understood how to make a trivia game that went beyond a simple question/answer format with several different mini games included.At the opposite end of the spectrum, we have games like Knowledge Trainer: Trivia. Its barely got any discernible personality to speak of, and it makes only the barest effort to go beyond a basic format: it breaks your questions up into blocks of ten, and it awards you a Knowledge Quotient, which roughly correlates with how many questions you get right, and their level of difficulty.And thats really all there is. You can compete against up to 3 other players, but its not like the game changes that much  its still 10 questions, youre just competing with others to see who can get the most right answers. At 6,000 questions and 10 different categories, theres also a decent variety when it comes to those questions.", "date": "January 7, 2020", "grade": "C+"}
