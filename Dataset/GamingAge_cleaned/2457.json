{"name": "Fashion Police Squad", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/03/fashion-police-squad-review-for-nintendo-switch-playstation-xbox-pc/", "text": "Given that the first DOOM came out thirty years ago, at this point if you call a game a DOOM clone its safe to say people will know what you mean: first person shooter, lots of earthy colours, probably plenty of demons. However, in the case of Fashion Police Squad, the descriptor DOOM clone doesnt entirely work. While it was undoubtedly inspired by that seminal shooter, and borrows quite a bit from it, in practice its a very different game than any other DOOM clone Ive ever seen.I mean, just look at its name and its premise. Youre playing as Sergeant Des, a fashionable cop out to rid the streets of crimes against fashion. While you have firearms, theyre far from your usual weaponry: rather than bullets, youre firing splashes of colour at drab grey suits, or shooting sewing needles that take in baggy suits, or, uh, firing gnomes at tourists wearing socks and sandals. The whole game could almost be described as a parody of first-person shooters  but its not, not when it works on its own as well as Fashion Police Squad does.Dont get me wrong, in a lot of ways it feels like a parody of the genre. If the sock gnomes didnt tip you off that Fashion Police Squad doesnt take itself totally seriously, then maybe the level-ending fashion shows will do it. Or the enemies who fly around powered by their own flatulence. Or the voice shouting things like Seductive and Fabulous every time you transform someones outfit. But just because Fashion Police Squad isnt afraid to poke fun at itself and its genre doesnt mean that its not a well-made game. On top of the inventive weaponry, the levels are laid out very well, managing to be fairly linear without it feeling like youre just being funneled along. The enemies, too, are spaced out well, with a few difficulty spikes here and there to ensure it never feels too easy, even at the easiest difficulty level.And, of course, Id be remiss if I didnt mention the swinging. If youre looking for one area where Fashion Police Squad looked beyond its obvious influences and into a different genre, its clear that someone on the development team loved Spider-Man and wanted to incorporate that love into the game. As a result, you can swing through some levels, and its some of the most enjoyable web-slinging  er, belt-slinging?  that Ive played outside of some Spider-Man games.To be sure, Fashion Police Squad isnt going to make you forget the games its borrowing from. But part of why its so fun is because its poking fun at a genre that can sometimes feel like it hasnt evolved much since the original DOOM, and showing that theres still room for it to grow and evolve. As Fashion Police Squad shows, theres still some life  and some room to innovate  in the old genre yet.", "date": "March 22, 2023", "grade": "B+"}
