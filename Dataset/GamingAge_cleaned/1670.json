{"name": "Treasures of Montezuma: Arena", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/08/treasures-montezuma-arena-review-ps-vita/", "text": "If youve had your Vita a couple of years, you probably remember playing Treasures of Montezuma: Blitz. It came out during the handhelds troubled first year, back when the phrase Vita has no games! wasnt just an uninformed talking point, but was, essentially, true. Consequently, even though ToM: Blitz wasnt great  it was your standard match-3 puzzle game it was still pretty widely played on account of there being little else at the time.Considering how many more games are out for the Vita now, I suspect that Treasures of Montezuma: Arena wont get nearly the same pick-up. This is kind of unfortunate; even though Im pleased the once-dead system is now getting a steady stream of titles, Arena is the better game, and it deserves the same kind of audience that Blitz had.To be sure, its still just match-3 game. That part hasnt changed. Whats different, however, is that ToM: Arena has a bunch of stuff surrounding that core mechanic. Theres a story, for starters. Theres competition  no longer are you just racing against the clock, but rather, via that aforementioned storyline, youre fighting against all kinds of monsters and demons. The pick-ups and weapons are a lot easier to use and understand than they ever were in Blitz.The biggest change, though? The fact that even though its a F2P game, it doesnt feel like one to the same extent that Blitz did. Whereas that first game was constantly reminding you of how your experience would be improved if youd just open your wallet, in Arena you can easily get by without spending a cent. There are upgrades to be had, but truthfully, the only time I even looked at the add-ons in the PlayStation Store was when I accidentally clicked on that button. You can easily play through the game without having to spend a cent, which, as far as Im concerned, is pretty great value.", "date": "August 13, 2014", "grade": "B"}
