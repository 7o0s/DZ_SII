It was released on the Switch with that name in *checks calendar* 2023. If you were looking for an inauspicious omen about how much care was put into this port: its right there in the name. I get that picking on the games name is low-hanging fruit, but Motorcycle Mechanic Simulator 2021  or, as no one has ever called it, MMS21  is one of those Switch ports that doesnt seem like a whole lot of attention was put into it, and you dont need to look very hard to see why. As far as I can tell, this is a straight port of the PC game (which was first released back in 2021, when the name made sense!). PC games, of course, have the benefit of mouse and keyboard, which are helpful in simulators like this where you need to be able to zoom in on very small parts and perform precise actions.On the Switch, by contrast, its a chore. And not even a chore in a good way, as youd hope for in a game thats kind of literally about doing chores. Rather, it asks you to use either touch controls or the thumbstick/button combo to do tasks like finding lots of tiny little parts scattered all over the motorcycles without much in the way of direction, and then painstakingly unscrewing the screws holding the parts in place. As you can imagine, its painfully unfun. Once youve done all the tasks for each new motorcycle that comes into the shop, you get to test ride them, which is a nice bonus  but to get there, youre performing lots of menial labour, and as soon as youre done the test ride its back to doing more menial labour.To be fair, as someone who doesnt even have a drivers license, Im not exactly knowledgeable when it comes to motorcycle parts, so I was at a bit of a disadvantage in figuring out what the game was asking me to fix. But at the same time, last year we had Rover Mechanic Simulator from the same publisher, and even if I didnt particularly enjoy it, I could at least say it was playable on a console. I dont think the same can be said for Motorcycle Mechanic Simulator 2021, since youre going to spend a lot more time here fighting with the fiddly camera and controls than you are fixing up and riding bikes. Which means, ultimately, that theres no real reason to pick Motorcycle Mechanic Simulator 2021 up on the Switch. It might be fine on PC (though the Steam reviews indicate even thats a bit of a mixed bag), but as far as the Switch release goes, even if youre a huge fan of motorcycles, youre better of skipping this one.", "date": "February 15, 2023", "grade": "D+"}
