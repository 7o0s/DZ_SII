I mean, I cant stop playing it either, to the point that I found it difficult to even drag myself away and write this review. But the real sign of addiction, at least for me, is that I find holedown occupying my thoughts every waking moment when Im not playing it.Of course, this is the whole point of holedown. It got its start as a mobile game last year, and its exactly the sort of addictive timewaster for which it feels like the mobile genre was invented. Its incredibly simple, with gameplay that recalls Brick Breaker (or, if you want to go even more old school, Breakout): you fire balls at blocks with numbers on them, and every time a ball hits a block that number decreases. Get it down to zero, and the block breaks. Fail to break a block before the block reaches the top of the screen, and its game over.While theres some strategy to it all  you have to figure out the angles just so if you want to take full advantage of rebounds and caroms  its the kind of thing that anyone can play. And yet, its designed to be just challenging enough that youll keep going back again and again just to get a little bit deeper each time (theres a vague space theme here, since youre ostensibly mining down into a planets core).Whats more, holedown has one of the most instantly gratifying moments Ive ever experienced in a game: the amazing chaos that ensues when you get an angle just right, and you suddenly have 20, 30, 40+ balls flying around the screen at a rapid pace, taking out blocks left and right as a full screen suddenly empties out.Heres how much I love holedown: even though its arrived on the Switch at a substantial markup ($10, compared to around $4-5 on iOS and Android), it still feels worth it. Ive spent the last few days doing nothing but playing this game, and seeing it flash across my mind when Im not. If thats not the definition of a great game, I dont know what is.", "date": "December 2, 2019", "grade": "A"}
