Its published by Ratalaika, and its a fairly easy platformer that can clearly be classified as a Metroidvania, albeit one with far fewer branching paths than the typical game from that subgenre.In other words, its Prehistoric Dude all over again, only with mice instead of cavemen. Admittedly, that comparison doesnt totally work, since where I enjoyed Prehistoric Dude, my feelings towards Micetopia fell somewhere between tolerated and resigned myself to it.Nonetheless, its remarkable how similar they are, once you get beyond the mouse vs. caveman thing. Micetopia, too, is a Metroidvania that you can finish in an hour or two, a platformer that requires you to search every inch of its small map. Its seldom very demanding, and youll be able to add its Platinum trophy to your collection without breaking much of a sweat.The difference, however, is that Micetopia isnt all that fun. There are only two levels to it, basically, and youll spend far more time in the first area than the second one. Moreover, there are only a couple of enemy types in the whole game, and none of them are very aggressive or require much in the way of skill to beat. In fact, one of them, a crab-like creature, basically just sits there and waits for you to stumble across it and kill it; the only time it moves is to go a single step in either direction, which is often the only way you can tell it apart from the background.Mind you, its probably a good thing none of the enemies are very challenging, because the combat here is awful. Your mouse is equipped only with a short, useless sword and an ever-so-slightly-less-useless bow and arrow, and neither of them cause much damage. The game is also very stingy with its upgrades, so for the most part, youre better off simply running and jumping past every enemy until you discover the gems/free the mouse hostages/reach the bosses (though, obviously, youll need to fight the bosses  you shouldnt be surprised to learn theyre not very difficult).To be fair, I dont want to give the impression that Micetopia is a terrible game or anything, because its not. It doesnt try or claim to be anything more than a basic Metroidvania-style platformer, and it delivers that. Its just..its so basic, and so forgettable, its hard to feel very enthusiastic about anything here. If you want a game you can play for 2 hours, see everything it has to offer, and then never think about it again, Micetopia will deliver that, but its hard not to think that you should want a little more out of what youre playing.", "date": "January 20, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
