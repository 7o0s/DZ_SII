It still highlights the What couldve been aspect of the Vita, a place for established franchises to branch out in unexpected directions, where buttons and touch controls work comfortably side by side. Admittedly, mobile has taken the place of handhelds as far as the former goes, but nothing can touch the Vita as far as the latter goes.Moreover, just as Hitman GO showed that that franchise lent itself well to a board game setting, so too does Lara Croft GO show that Tomb Raider-style action and exploration and puzzle/board games arent as far apart as you might expect. Here youre still given ample opportunity to hunt for treasure and dodge all kinds of dangerous creatures, all while having to solve some pretty clever puzzles. Its a fun mix, and its the sort of thing that (as countless mobile gamers already knew) lends itself well to gaming on the go.That said, Lara Croft GO isnt quite as perfect as Hitman GO. For starters, the load times here range from interminable to ridiculous; there were definitely moments where I spent more time waiting for levels to begin than I did playing the levels themselves. On top of that, the controls dont seem to be as tight as they could be. Maybe Im just misremembering how well Hitman GO did it, but there were numerous points in Lara Croft GO where the need for very precise movements was counterbalanced by a bit of unfortunate ambiguity in terms of the direction in which you had to send Ms. Croft.", "date": "December 28, 2016", "grade": "A"}
