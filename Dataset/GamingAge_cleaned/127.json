After all, ot certainly feels a lot like one. Its built around a fairly simple premise  you have to mow a lawn  that gradually gets a little more complex, and as you play you earn in-game currency to buy better lawnmowers, which feels like a thankfully unexplored avenue for monetization.Mind you, its also a game that would be nearly impossible to play on a touchscreen, so playing it with a proper D-pad feels like a much more natural fit.In any case, the best way I can describe Grass Cutter  Mutated Laws is what Pac-Man would be like, if Pac-Man were mowing lawns instead of eating pellets. You direct your lawnmower around a lawn, eating up squares of grass and avoiding hazards like ponds, sprinklers, and, er, monsters, and you regularly have to make quick, sharp turns (which would be hell if you were trying to steer with a touchscreen).Itd all be pretty boring if it werent for the fact that Grass Cutter has one heck of a soundtrack. Even if the game itself starts feeling repetitive early on, the thumping beat that accompanies the game  and that even plays through loading screens  will make you want to keep playing well after youve grown bored of the gameplay.Unfortunately, thats not enough to make Grass Cutter  Mutated Lawns worth playing. Worth listening to, sure, but unless you dont mind paying console prices for something that feels like itd be a lot cheaper if it had come out on the App Store just for a great soundtrack, your money is probably better off spent elsewhere.", "date": "July 24, 2019", "grade": "C"}
