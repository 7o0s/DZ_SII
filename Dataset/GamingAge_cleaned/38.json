{"name": "Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/10/nelly-cootalot-the-fowl-fleet-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Its not very hard to see that Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is very much influenced by the old Monkey Island series. I mean, its a funny adventure game about pirates. If thats not a succinct description of Monkey Island, I dont know what is.Thats not a complaint, mind you. After all, the Monkey Island games were generally a notch above their competitors, so if youre going to steal, you may as well steal from the best. Even more importantly, though, were a decade past the last new Monkey Island game, and about two and a half decades since anyone gave the series much thought. If theyre no longer using the ideas, theres no reason why this game cant pick up that torch.Especially when the results are as pleasant as The Fowl Fleet. While its clearly not going to win any awards for originality, it makes up for that with a good sense of humour, breezy dialogue, and fun characters given life by very solid voice actors. Couple that with an engaging story about the titular heroine searching for treasure, and you can see why its easy to get sucked in.On top of that, the puzzles here mostly make sense. Given that you couldnt say the same about many point and click adventures from the genres golden age, thats actually a pretty impressive accomplishment. Sure, its still all picking up random objects and using them in inventive ways, but there are no insane leaps of logic that typified some of the genres worst excesses. Just about the only real drawback to the Fowl Fleet is the controls are a little finicky. Its clear that the game was designed to be played with a keyboard and mouse, and somehow touch controls dont quite do the trick. It means youll have to tap around occasionally until you find just the right angle for certain things, which slows down the proceedings ever so slightly.", "date": "October 2, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
