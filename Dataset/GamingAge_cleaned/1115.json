{"name": "Unepic", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/05/unepic-review-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-wii-u/", "text": "Humor is a pretty tough thing for games to pull off. For every Portal or Portal 2, there are dozens of Duke Nukems and Bulletstorms andwell, pretty much everything not named Portal. Its also highly subjective, which means that what one person finds hilarious, others will find annoying or offensive or just plain dumb  as evidenced, undoubtedly, by the fact there are some people who wholly disagreed with every aspect of that last sentence.I say that as a preamble to writing about Unepic because, as a Metroidvania parody, its meant to be a funny game. It starts when you take a wrong turn on a bathroom break during a D&D game, and soon after that you get possessed by a put-upon demon whom youre constantly antagonizing with snarky comments. Pretty much everything is done with a wink, and the game loves to give genre meta-commentary and break the fourth wall as much as possible.Needless to say, Unepics not nearly as funny as it would like to believe it is. Thats not entirely its fault, of course. Considering the ratio of funny to not-funny games, the odds were against it falling on the good side of that equation. Alternately, if were thinking of humour less as a dichotomy and more as a funny-unfunny spectrum, its definitely closer to the middle of that spectrum than it is to the unfunny side. Plus, of course, theres the whole subjectivity factor to consider. If your tolerance for snarky meta-humour is higher than mine, you may well love Unepic.Because of that last point  that the quality of Unepics humor is largely in the eye of the beholder  its worth considering the game apart from its humorous aspects.Of course, on that front, its still nothing special. Strip away the parodic aspects of the game, and you go from a Metroidvania parody to a straight-up Metroidvania-style platformer. Youre running around a castle, battling monsters, opening chests and uncovering secrets, and youre doing it in a way thatll be familiar if youve ever played any other games in the genre before.", "date": "May 20, 2016", "grade": "B-"}
