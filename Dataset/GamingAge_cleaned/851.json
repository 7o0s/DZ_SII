{"name": "Dragon Quest Builders", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/04/dragon-quest-builders-review-ps4-ps-vita/", "text": "As much as Id like to pretend otherwise, Im not a particularly creative person, at least when it comes to video games. Give me a wide open world with no directions or set goals, and I become paralyzed with indecision. Its a big reason why Ive never been able to get into games like Minecraft, Terreria, or even Dont Starve, despite repeated attempts. Ill take a linear plot and clear objectives any day of the week.This explains why Im such a fan of Dragon Quest Builders. While, at heart, its not all that different from Minecraft  youre still in a sandbox, able to build things to your hearts content  it gives the game an RPG sheen that makes it much easier for people like me, who have neither the time nor the inclination nor the talent to, say, build a space shuttle or create a scale model of my bedroom. Theres a story here, complete with chapters: youre the Legendary Builder, and its up to you to restore humanitys imagination and overthrow the evil Dragonlord. There are quests. There are enemies to fight. Essentially, this is a game that takes the best parts of both worlds, crams them together, and makes something well worth a look.What makes it work, I think, is that it doesnt demand too much of players. Thats not to say its not a demanding game, or that its too easy. Rather, I mean that it has a low barrier to entry. Being a Dragon Quest fan probably helps you enjoy it more, but its not like being deeply immersed in the franchises lore is a prerequisite for enjoying the game. Similarly, it doesnt expect you to memorize all kinds of crazy controls, or learn lots and lots of different skills. Everything  from crafting, to combat, to movement, to the camera  is wonderfully intuitive.Of course, what probably helps even more is that Dragon Quest Builders knows how to suck you in and keep you interested. The game is broken down into chapters, with each chapter representing a new area of the game opening up to you. Its an interesting way of setting things up, and it makes the sheer size of the world seem a little less intimidating  which is a good thing, because Dragon Quest Builders world is pretty sizeable.", "date": "April 28, 2017", "grade": "A"}
