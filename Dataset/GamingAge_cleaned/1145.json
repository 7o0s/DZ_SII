{"name": "Pixel Hunter", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/04/pixel-hunter-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "There are a few positive things to be said about Pixel Hunter, but unfortunately none of them outweigh this key fact: the platforming aspect of it isnt particularly good. Seeing as its essentially a platformer, thats kind of a fatal flaw.Id like to be higher on it than I am. Its got a cute, retro-influenced art-style that captures the look and feel of early 3D games pretty perfectly. Its got bright, vivid colours that pop off the screen. The music isnt half-bad, and echoes its early gaming influences without directly stealing from them. From an aesthetic perspective, Pixel Hunter has a lot going for it.In terms of the gameplay, though? Thats where Pixel Hunter falls apart. As I said up top, as a platformer it falls flat. The game demands that you make all these crisp, precise jumps, and then makes it so that the controls dont allow you to move with any degree of precision. There was no consistency to jumping distances, nor could the game ever seem to decide just how far enemies could get from you before knocking off part of your life. When jumping and avoiding enemies are two-thirds of what youre doing in a game, not getting either right is pretty much a death knell.Oh, and the other third of the gameplay is shooting  Pixel Hunter is a run & gun platformer  andwell, it kind of sucks on that front too. As with the jumping, its impossible to shoot your gun with any degree of precision. While this isnt a huge issue for the most part, since you can generally blast away many of the enemies just by constantly firing your shotgun, there are a few bad guys here that call for a little more finesse, and as should be apparent by now, finesse is one quality thats in very short supply here.", "date": "April 15, 2016", "grade": "D+"}
