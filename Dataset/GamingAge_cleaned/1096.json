I was trapped in my house, and every time I opened a door, found myself face-to-face with horrifying monsters.Is that boring to read about? I would think so. After all, in general, when someone tells you, I had the craziest/scariest/freakiest dream last night, the story that follows is usually only of interest to the person telling it. (Though Id like to think that the aforementioned dream ending with me turning into He-Man and being able to leave my house unimpeded would count for an unexpected twist.)I mention this in the context of Neverending Nightmares because its boring. I get that its creator Matt Gilgenbachs way of conveying his own personal journey through mental illness and OCD, and I wish I could say literally anything other than that, but the fact is theres really no other way to describe it. There are only so many times you can slowly shuffle your way through an Edward Gorey-inspired house before it loses its appeal. In fact, if I were a truly snarky kind of person, I might even suggest that the number of times is roughly zero.That, however, would be overstating things, because even if Neverending Nightmares ends up pretty dull, it also does some things fairly well. For starters, there is that Gorey influence; any time you can bring to mind creations like his, youre doing at least one thing right. Not only that, Gilgenbach uses colours pretty well; in a game thats largely black and white, theres something distinctly unsettling about the occasional splash of blood-red. On a related note, the sounds  the creaks and groans and moans  do a decent job of making you feel a little unsettled, particularly if youre playing the game with headphones.Unfortunately, once you get past the atmosphere, I dont think theres as much to recommend. As I said, the game consists of you waking up, walking around, dying, and then waking up again. Wake up, walk, die, wake up, walk, die: however accurately that may convey the feeling of being an Obsessive-Compulsive person, it doesnt make for the most riveting experience. It also doesnt help that you move at a crawl through each room, and any attempt to speed up ends with you wheezing and gasping for breath a few moments later.", "date": "June 22, 2016", "grade": "C"}
