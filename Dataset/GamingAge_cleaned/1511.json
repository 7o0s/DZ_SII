Its the kind of game that seems like it was tailor-made for mobile devices, but its a surprisingly terrible fit for the Vita. Meanwhile, it plays really well on the PS4but who wants to play a mobile game on the PS4? On the latter point, dont get me wrong: I have no complaints about indie games on the PS4. I love them on the Vita, and I love them on Sonys home console, too. But were talking about a game where the bite-sized levels are literally a minute long, where youre doing the whole try and get three stars! thing thats the point of most mobile games in the post-Angry Birds era, and where the entirety of the games mechanics are basically on the table by the end of the second level or so. If thats not the very definition of a mobile, I dont know what is. I dont want to be too harsh on Minutes for PS4, since, as I said, it works pretty well. The games variation on the bullet hell formula, wherein youre navigating a little circle around the screen collecting lines of one colour while avoiding those of another, lends itself well to a larger screen and the DS4s larger thumbsticks. But  and I cant emphasize this enough  thats all there is to the game. You get a couple of power-ups later on that add a little bit of variation, but even then, its not as if this game could turn into a massive time-sink.In other words, Minutes is exactly the kind of game that should work on the Vita  the sort of thing you squeeze in between classes and during short commutes. But it just doesnt work that way. No matter how much the gameplay and mechanics might be suited to gaming on the go, theyre totally betrayed by the smaller screen size and smaller thumbsticks. This may simply come down to my own personal preferences, of course, but I always felt like the screen wasnt big enough to show everything that needed to be shown, nor did I feel like I was allowed/able to navigate the circle around as quickly as it needed to be.", "date": "February 18, 2015", "grade": "B"}
