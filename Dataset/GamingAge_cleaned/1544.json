As side-scrolling platformers go, Ive definitely played worse. It has a reasonably coherent story, so its not like youre ever wondering whats going on. The controls generally work as theyre supposed to, though considering were only talking about a 2.5D platformer (with the occasional 3D section), thats not something to brag about. The graphics are kind of okay  not dazzling, but they get the job done without ever tearing or glitching or doing anything they shouldnt. In every respect, Flyhunter Origins is competent. Its workmanlike. When people say it is what it is, they could be talking about this very game.And thats not necessarily a bad thing! There are all kinds of games that could only dream of being described as competent, workmanlike, or solidly average. For Flyhunter Origins to do that is certainlywell, not quite a stupendous achievement, but it still counts for something. I guess. In a way.The problem is that most people want games that are more than simply just there. They want to play games that are memorable or fun, and I dont think those are adjectives that could be used to describe Flyhunter Origins. Start with the story: you play as an alien who accidentally jettisoned your ships crew, and you have to go out into space to retrieve everyone and everything you lost. As I said, its straightforward enough  but its still presented and told in the most boring way imaginable. I cant say I was ever compelled to keep playing just to see what would happen next (though it didnt help that the main character sounded like a cross between Bentley from Sly Cooper and the little green aliens from Toy Story). It all just sort of ambles along until it comes to a conclusion about 20 (most short) levels later.The graphics are similarly meh. Outside of the moderately decent-looking cutscenes, nothing here is that visually impressive. While the in-game graphics occasionally veer into eyesore territory, with greens and yellows that are far too bright, for the most part you get drab visuals that bring early-era PS2 games to mind. To their credit, they never falter, but again, generally stays in one piece seems like the absolute basic you should expect from a game.If theres one area where Flyhunter Origins kind of falls down  rather than just staying upright  its when were talking about the controls. Generally, theyre okay, since the game isnt too demanding; youre just walking backwards and forwards, jumping up to higher levels and swatting/zapping enemy bugs. This, Flyhunter Origins can handle. When it gets more complicated, though  i.e. when you have to jump from one small, flimsy surface to another, or when you need to rapidly evade spiders plunging down at you from the ceiling  then things get a little harder to handle. Standing on a drooping leaf, for example, you can never quite tell when you can stand on an edge or when youll plummet to your death; seeing as youll spend a big portion of the game standing on the edges of leaves, you can see why it might be considered an issue.But only a bit of an issue  though perhaps its only a bit of an issue (rather than a huge one) because it seems hard to muster up too much outrage over such a mediocre game. If Flyhunter Origins were great otherwise it would be the cause of great consternation, while it could be one more enraging thing if the whole game sucked. If its just one more mild annoyance in a game thats full of mild annoyances, though, its hard to get too worked up.", "date": "December 30, 2014", "grade": "C"}
