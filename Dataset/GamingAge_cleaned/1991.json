{"name": "Pool Nation", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/pool-nation-review-for-psn-xbla/", "text": "Im horrendously bad at pool. Theres not a single aspect of the game in which I can even feign competence. When I sink a ball, its cause for wild celebration on my part. And that usually goes for video game billiards as well, regardless of the system. Im not sure what my problem with the sport is, but I do know that if Im expected to push a ball into a hole with a stick, Im going to suck on a massive scale.Somewhat miraculously, Pool Nation is the one exception to this rule. Im far from great at the game  I still dont have a clue what Im doing when it comes to trick shots, which means I dont have a chance against some of the tougher AI players (of which there are many)  but its the first time in my life Ive ever played pool in any form and not totally embarrassed myself. That, by itself, is a pretty impressive achievement.Shockingly, at least to me, an avowed pool-hater whose dislike of the game is no doubt caused by his ineptitude, easy-to-use controls arent all the game has going for it. It looks and soundswell, cool, for lack of a better, more specific descriptor. The music is all downtempo and suave-sounding, while the graphics wrap the whole thing up in an icy (in a good way), neon-drenched (also in a good way) package. Even if real-life pool is generally confined to dingy bars and sketchy halls, Pool Nation makes it seem like the most glamorous thing imaginable.There is, of course, a but to all this  and here it is: as fantastic as the game looks, sounds and plays, it gets awfully repetitive awfully quickly. While I was initially ecstatic at being able to play a game of pool somewhat competently, it didnt take long before that gave way to boredom. And I say this as a sports gamer who loves to play games on their easiest settings  in other words, as someone who usually doesnt mind a bit of repetition.Of course, theres a key difference between a game of football in Madden or a game of baseball in The Show, and a game of pool in Pool Nation: those games last a lot longer and have much more varied outcomes than youll ever get out of a game in Pool Nation. Even as the game boasts the presence of nine different modes, with the exception of the endurance challenge (where more and more balls keep getting placed around the table) they all feel almost exactly the same, and pretty much every match is over in a matter of minutes.", "date": "July 17, 2013", "grade": "B"}
