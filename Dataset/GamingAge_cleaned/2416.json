{"name": "Trine 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/01/review-trine-2/", "text": "Gamers were blown away in 2009 with the puzzle platformer called Trine hit PCs, and afterwards the PS3 via the PlayStation Network.  The game was rather short, so gamers were obviously left wanting more.  Well your wish is the developers command.  Now you too can witness Trines universe with its amazing visuals, fun platforming, and mind-bending puzzles in this sequel that does everything bigger, badder, and better, just like a sequel ought to.You play as a Knight, a Wizard, and a Thief and the mysterious Trine has appeared again requesting all three to make another appearance in order to save the kingdom once again.  Told in storybook fashion that has some humorous voice-overs, you wont really gather much of a story that has depth, per se, that makes you care about the characters, but it is more like something youd read your five year old at bedtime.  As with the original, it isnt the games storyline that provides merit, but instead the look and feel of Trine 2 will capture you and suck you into the fantasy.Trine 2 uses a 2.5D style of platforming and art that will allow gamers to move left and right, up and down in 2D fashion, while the world and objects are fully 3D rendered.  The colors, lighting, shadows, and designs of not only the world of Trine 2, but the enemies and bosses will make the eyes water with tears of joy.  Whether you are jumping off giant mushrooms, or fleeing from spider web filled caves, each level provides a diverse and unique sense of design and wonder.  The games real star of the show is the game play elements that mix different styles from each of your 3 playable characters.  The wizard is weak, but can levitate and conjure blocks out of thin air to help reach places hes too feeble to do so on his own.  The knight can break his way through obstacles and fend off greater foes.  Lastly, the thief will use her grappling hook to reach places up high and out of reach and her bow attacks can take down enemies at a distance.  The first level allows you to familiarize yourself with each characters unique play scheme, but from after that you are on your own to figure out which one will get you past certain obstacles, but fret not as you can select any charter on the fly and use them when the time is at hand.  Whats more, you can call up a friend to play on or off line in a 2 or even 3 player co-op mode to use as many heads and brains it takes to make it though the games 8 levels.  Of course the game can be just as simply conquered on a solo experience as long as you are familiar with the ways of the warriors.  Of course what good platformer doesnt have objects and collectibles spread out through the levels to have you trying them over and over again to gain that 100 percent mark.", "date": "January 6, 2012", "grade": "B+"}
