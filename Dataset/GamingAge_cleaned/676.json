{"name": "Knowledge is Power", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/11/knowledge-power-review-ps4/", "text": "Im of two minds on Knowledge is Power.On the one hand, I cant help but compare it to so many trivia games Ive played on various systems over the years: You Dont Know Jack, Trivial Pursuit, Jeopardy, and various games in the Buzz! series all spring to mind. And by that standard, its kind of lacking. There arent a ton of features, the mini-games are pretty bland, and the questions generally arent that difficult. The host, while personable, lacks the personality of Cookie Masterson or Alex Trebel (or even Buzz!s host), and just comes off as generic. Its not terrible, but its not the kind of thing Id urge everyone to rush out and buy.On the other hand, however, I feel like I need to look at Knowledge is Power from the point of view of my wife. This game is, after all, a party game geared towards more casual players, and seeing as my wife has only a passing acquaintance at best with YKDJ and Jeopardy, it seems like her perspective may be the more valid one. And on that front: she enjoyed it.I dont think shed say it blew her away or anything, but at the very least, she kind of got into it, which is more than could be said about how shes reacted to YKDJ. She loved the bright visuals and characters, and the fact you could use your smartphone as a controller made the game more intuitive and, I suspect, less intimidating than it wouldve been with a DualShock.", "date": "November 14, 2017", "grade": "B"}
