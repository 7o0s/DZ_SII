{"name": "Fobia  St. Dinfna Hotel", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/08/fobia-st-dinfna-hotel-review-for-playstation-xbox-pc/", "text": "If you follow any team sport, youre likely familiar with the idea of a role player. If not, the term is pretty self-explanatory: its a player who isnt a star, but who fills a particular niche. They deserve to play, but theyre not someone who youd build a team around.I mention that because Fobia  St. Dinfna Hotel is basically the gaming equivalent of that. Its a solid survival horror game. Its not going to blow you away, and unless youre really into the genre its probably not something you need to play, but its decent enough that if youre a fan of Silent Hill and Resident Evil and all their descendents, then its definitely something youll want to at least check out.To Fobias credit, it does this by simply having a lot of the right pieces. Its got a creepy setting: the eponymous hotel that goes from vaguely unsettling to completely nightmarish in the blink of an eye. Its got a decent plot: a journalist investigating said hotel, who quickly gets in way over his head. Its got an interesting mechanic: in addition to your gun, you have a camera that helps you see different timelines. And, of course, its got a creepy girl in a gasmask who pops up every now and then on the edge of your vision just to make the game a tiny bit more unsettling.What stops Fobia from being a great game in its own right is that the game never feels all that original. Whether youre running from monsters (or trying to shoot them with somewhat ineffectual weapons), going from one floor of the hotel to another and back again to solve puzzles, or switching between timelines to uncover essential items, all of it feels like something thats been done plenty of times before. Mind you, thats a wholly subjective critique  and as I said, if youre fond of survival horror, then it may not bother you too much to see the game hit the genre beats so well.Just about the only major, non-subjective critique of Fobia is that it has some technical issues. Literally every time the game went from a cutscene to gameplay, thered be a pause of about ten seconds or so where the game freezes. For the most part, thats just highly annoying  but there were moments, where the game puts you in peril and you need to run away or shoot at something, where the freezing is the difference between life and death.Still, if you can overlook that, Fobia  St. Dinfna Hotel provides some pretty solid chills. Its not the sort of game that will wow you unless youre already a fan of survival horror, but if you are a fan, it serves as a pretty solid reminder of the good things the genre has to offer.", "date": "August 8, 2022", "grade": "B+"}
