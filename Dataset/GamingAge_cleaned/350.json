{"name": "de Blob 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/11/de-blob-2-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Heres how I know that I truly love de Blob: in the past year, Ive played and reviewed the re-released versions of the original game and its sequel, de Blob 2, in their entirety twice: first on Xbox One, and now again on the Switch. For me to go back to a game after Ive finished it once is exceedingly rare; for me to do that basically four times in less than a year practically qualifies as a miracle.Obviously, at this point theres not much more I can say about the games that I havent already said at length at some point in the past ten months. But whatever: when youre as fond of the series as I am, it always feels worthwhile to point out just how much fun the games are. Theres always something thats just so wonderfully satisfying about bringing life and colour to a monochromatic world.de Blob 2 on the Switch is, of course, no exception, and literally everything I about the Xbox One/PS4 edition earlier this year applies here, too. The graphics are much nicer than they were in the re-released versions of the original de Blob, largely because the jump from PS3/Xbox 360 to Switch/Xbox One/PS4 is significantly easier for the game to navigate than the transition from Wii to current gen systems. Likewise, the worlds here feel so much more interesting here than they did in the original, with more to do and, just as importantly, more frequent save points.Admittedly, the flaws of all the other versions are also present here. This series never did get its camera right (hopefully something that can be fixed if they ever get around to making a third game); even if its mildly better here than in the first game, its still far from perfect. Theres also a little too much handholding here. It makes some sense, given the family-friendly nature of the series, but that doesnt make it any less tedious.But thats the only thing tedious about de Blob 2. Once you get beyond the early levels, the game is more than willing to let you do your thing, and thats when you cant help but be drawn in to its colourful word. Theres no way of telling whether well ever get a third instalment in the franchise, but if we dont, then de Blob 2 is a delightful high note for the series to end on (and, as a sidenote, its great to see the proper sequel finally arrive on a Nintendo system, after Nintendo owners were stuck with a significantly different version last time around).", "date": "November 16, 2018", "grade": "A-"}
