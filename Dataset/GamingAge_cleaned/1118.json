I certainly dont love it as much as some people do. I look at some of those raves, and I compare them to my own experience with the game, and Im just left wondering what it was that I missed.I dont want to give the impression that I hated it, mind you. I definitely didnt. In fact, as a roguelike platformer with short levels and easy-to-grasp controls, I thought it was ideally suited to the Vita. Theres no question that its the kind of game you can drop into and out of without a) feeling like you need to re-acquaint yourself with the story or the controls, or b) having to worry that youll forget your place and need to start over. As someone who primarily plays games on my way to work, I appreciated that.I cant say my feelings towards Risk of Rain ever went beyond mere appreciation, though. Maybe the 8-bit graphics didnt do much for me. Maybe it was the way perma-death made it feel like you never really advanced (though to the games credit, it still allowed you to carry over some of your discoveries from game to game). Maybe I didnt get the full experience, on account of the fact I never played the games multiplayer mode (though in my defense, I dont think Ive ever enjoyed a game more after playing it in multiplayer).", "date": "May 16, 2016", "grade": "B"}
