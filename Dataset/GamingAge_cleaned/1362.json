Instead, most of the controversy has circled around the art, and the relatively minor cuts that publisher Atlus had to make in order to bring the game down to an M rating from an AO.While its worth touching on those points in this review, its also worth talking about the mechanics in Dungeon Travelers 2, which Ive found to be pretty solid. Its a first-person dungeon crawler, very much in the vein of something like the Etrian Odyssey series, minus the map-building mechanic. But in lieu of that. Dungeon Travelers 2 does offer up a wide variety of classes and subclasses across the various characters youll encounter, with a large number of skills and loot to sift through and customize your party with.Its also pretty well balanced, difficulty-wise. The first group of initial dungeons you can explore start off small, and then introduce other concepts slowly. Multiple levels, trap tiles, random food shops, portals, and other things help to liven up your trip through these expanding dungeons. Along with that, most enemies arent pushovers, and its not too uncommon to encounter a few game over screens early on. I certainly had to make ample use of the save system, which thankfully you can access both on the field and at home base.Dungeon Travelers 2 also does a good job of rewarding grinding, but not so much that youll feel required to do it. When battling and then defeating a monster, your party absorbs the creature. If you absorb enough of any one creature, you can then create a Seal Book, which can then be equipped to a party member to enhance your skills, with effects like Enmity Up, or Physical Defense Up. Also, creating a Seal Book allows you to then see more information about that monster in a battle, including its strengths, weaknesses, and enemy level. And of course theres all the experience youll earn to level up, along with gold and item drops that can lead to valuable loot.Combat has a decent amount of strategy involved as well. Both your party and the monsters you encounter have two rows to position characters in. Back row characters are harder to hit with melee attacks, are generally better defended, and serve as the primary position for magic users. Front row characters will consist of your fighter/tank style characters, who are able to absorb a bit more damage than most. While magic attacks are remarkably powerful, even early on, theyre a bit slower to execute than a normal attack, and can be interrupted if the caster takes a hard enough hit. As you progress, youll gain passive combat skills in addition to special attacks and other abilities, which really helps to keep most encounters interesting. And provided you havent overleveled too much, youll need to stay on your toes for most fights, especially the much tougher boss battles against mutants.So obviously Dungeon Travelers 2 has a lot of great things going for it. Engaging combat, character and class variety, dungeon design and complexity, and a decent soundtrack to boot. But you cant ignore the elephant in the room with this game, and thats the hyper-sexualized imagery on display. Most monsters consist of scantily clad girls (with a handful of cutesy, non-humanoid monsters), which in and of itself isnt particularly awful. Your party characters, including some of the other NPCs, fit this mold as well, dressed in either revealing outfits or ridiculously proportioned to near Rob Liefeld levels of exaggeration. Again, if youve played a number of similar games on the Vita or other platforms, this isnt too much to take. The biggest, and worst offender, comes from the scenes that depict either your party members interacting with the single male group leader in, uh, very awkward yet supposedly innocent ways, or from the post-battle depictions of mutant bosses.These scenes get to be a bit much, and I imagine theyll be the biggest turn off for the average person that wants to give this a shot. Theyre unavoidable, and even tucked into an art gallery so you could peruse them separate from the story at any time. I dont necessarily think of myself as a prude, but clearly this artwork is not my fetish. It also makes it virtually impossible to play this game in any sort of public space, not without garnering some really questionable glances.", "date": "August 17, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
