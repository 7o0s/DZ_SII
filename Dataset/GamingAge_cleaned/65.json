I mean, its about a guy who befriends women just to steal their underwear. With a premise like that, how could it not be?Still, even for someone like me  who has played almost every single North American Vita release, who even found positive things to say about a game like Monster Monpiece  Pantsu Hunter seems like a bridge too far.Lets start with the obvious: theres no non-creepy way for a grown man to talk about panties. Its an infantilizing word in the very best of times, and in these circumstances  where you have a creep talking about them obsessively  it reads like the thoughts of a guy who would read Lolita and think that Humbert Humbert was a stand-up guy.In fact, thats probably putting it mildly. Like, this is the games official description: The story is about a young man who values womens beauty and especially the beauty of womens underwear. He is a jack of all trades and knows thousands of ways to get into the house of beautiful girl. Its not easy to find panties because decent girls dont store them in conspicuous places and wouldnt a strangers to take their underwear unless they like him.That verges on serial killer who wears the skin of his victims territory.Whats more, because Pantsu Hunter is a visual novel, pretty much the entire game is you experiencing the world through his pervy point of view. Theres really not much in the way of redeeming qualities here. Even if the soft-focus camera tries its best to convey a nostalgic vibe (hence the Back to the 90s subtitle), it all falls apart every time main character Kenji blathers on about how much he needs to steal underwear.That said, its hard not to appreciate that you get a trophy for causing Kenji to die five times. Its harsh but, all things considered, fair.Its also the only part of Pantsu Hunter thats even remotely tolerable. The rest will just make you want to burn your console. Or, better still, you could just not buy it, and save yourself the cringing and disgust that will inevitably accompany playing it.", "date": "September 12, 2019", "grade": "D-"}
