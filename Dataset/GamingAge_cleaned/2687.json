While I imagine this is the case for most people who arent fans of a very niche Japanese subgenre, in my case its actually kind of odd. See, GENSOU Skydrift represents the fourth Touhou Project-associated game Ive played, but to date my experience with the genre has consisted of a mediocre dungeon crawler, a mediocre Metroidvania platformer, and a mediocre (to be generous) fighting game. GENSOU Skydrift is, naturally, a kart-racer (of sorts). Want to guess how it turned out?If you guessed mediocre, congratulations, you were able to spot the pattern. I will give it credit, though: its middling, but its also incredibly odd.See, GENSOU Skydrift is kind of influenced by games like Mario Kart: Double-Dash, Crash Tag Team Racing, and Team Sonic Racing, in that youre racing against other characters from the Touhou Project universe. What sets it apart, however, is that your characters  and none of the characters, for that matter  have karts. Instead, they have each other.You read that right: this is a racing game where the barely pubescent girls ride each other. Its in order to combine their magical energies, of course.Somehow, though, despite that premise, GENSOU Skydrift is actually not remotely sexual. Rather, the girls ride each other like surfboards. Every so often, during the cutscenes between races, theyll comment on how bizarre it is, so at least the game is aware of how weird it isbut still, its pretty weird.Unfortunately, its not very interesting, even with that insane hook. This is due to the fact that the karts  er, the girls?  handle terribly. They dont corner so well (as youd expect, them being human beings and all, rather than karts), which is a pretty major drawback in a game where you have to drift around lots of really tight corners. In the games defense, of course, your AI opponents often seem to have the same difficulties, where theyll slam into corners and putter sideways until the track straightens out again, but thats not exactly a point in the games favour.I will say this for GENSOU Skydrift, however: it knows how to make distinctive tracks. There are 20 on offer here, and each of them feels completely unique from all the rest. While I wouldnt necessarily say any of the tracks are amazing, the game still deserves some credit for putting a lot of effort into making them look pretty distinctive. Admittedly, they often do so by going so over-the-top that Rainbow Road look sedate by comparison, but again: its distinctive.That doesnt mean that you have any reason to pick it up, though. GENSOU Skydrift may be essential if youre a Touhou Project fan who always wondered, Hey, how would those girls work as racing karts?, but for everyone else, there are plenty of other much better racers out there.", "date": "April 12, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
