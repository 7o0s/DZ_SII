{"name": "Burn The Rope", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/01/burn-the-rope-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Lets be honest: the question when it comes to Burn The Rope on the Vita isnt, Is it any good? Chances are, you probably already know the answer to that. After all, its been downloaded millions of times for free from Google Play/the Android Market, and millions more for 99 cents (give or take a dollar) through Apples App Store. As much as I love my Vita, I cant ignore the odds that most people who own Sonys handheld have probably already played Burn The Rope in some form somewhere else.As such, the real question most people reading this probably have are: why should I spend $4 on a Vita game when I can get it for under a dollar elsewhere?Truthfully, Im not sure that you should, since Burn The Rope on the Vita is almost exactly the same game as youd get on your smartphone or iDevice. You have a rope with bugs on it, you touch it, it starts a fire, and you turn the rope so that the fire keeps burning upwards. If youre lucky, you get 100%. Thats all there is to it.I mean, yes, there are some features on the Vita version that make it slightly different. You turn the rope by dragging your finger across the screen in this version, rather than having to turn your whole device around in circles. Theres no question thats an improvement over the original. You can also zoom in on various spots by pinching the rear touchscreen and moving the rope around with your left stick. Thats less of an improvement, since whatever advantage you gain from zooming in, you lose from it not being a particularly precise or responsive feature.Oh, and the Vita version has trophies. If youre the kind of person who prides him- or herself on having more of those, then youll find another sixteen you can snatch up here  though, it should be noted, a platinum isnt one of them.", "date": "January 11, 2013", "grade": "B"}
