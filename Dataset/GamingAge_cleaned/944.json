At its core this is a very simple game with a very simple concept, you and a ragtag crew of your best friends are dropped into a map where hoards of zombies (or Zeds) flood you from all directions and you must survive by any means necessary. A detailed class system that takes hours of gameplay to unlock will keep you involved well past the few hours that such a premise will usually hold a more casual fan.Killing Floor 2 has 10 unique classes you can choose from to fight off the waves of undead. A medic, a sharpshooter, a demolitions expert, a gunner and a cowboy cover just a few. Each of these classes has its own strengths and weaknesses and a place in the fight, but these dont become readily apparent until after a few hours of play with each one. At the start, every class can use every other classes weapons so there is not much incentive to pick the gunslinger over some of the other more staple classes. After really getting into a class though, you are able to start using the abilities that make it unique. This can prove frustrating however if you spend 3 hours playing a class you think you want to use, only to find out the abilities arent what you thought and now you have to start at square one with another class and run the risk of a repeat performance.The fighting itself is fantastic, managing to keep you on the brink of feeling overwhelmed but not to the point of hopelessness. The matches are intense and you will find yourself inching up in your seat as you near the end of a game. Visceral visual and audio effects also add to the feeling and satisfaction, as a headshot on a Zed pops them like an over-ripe melon and the sound effects fit what you are seeing perfectly. The accompanying metal soundtrack that undercuts every level only serves to heighten these feelings as you play.Enemies are plentiful and varied, with run-of-the-mill Zeds that appear to be nothing more than standard zombies, to screamers that bring back feelings of dread to any veteran Left for Dead players. Huge bloated enemies that vomit on you and lightning fast cloaked Zeds keep you on your toes at all times. After surviving the waves Zeds you are met with a boss. These are huge Zeds with giant health bars that are capable of dealing massive damage in a short amount of time. This is where your class selections as a team will make or break you. If everyone is in sync and working together then it will be tough. If it ends up being every man for himself, it is nigh impossible.In between waves you are given the opportunity to load up and spend the Dosh (money) that you have earned thus far. These reprieves are vital and stocking up should be done any time you have the chance, whether you feel you need it or not. Communication here is also key, that way everyone knows what everyone else has available. It is important to know if one player has X item, because 4 minutes later when that is the only thing that can save you, you know who to ask for. Playing as a team is the most important and satisfying part of Killing Floor 2. The feeling of accomplishment after completing a boss wave is great and a good team can play for hours without failing.After those hours however, many people will start to fall off. A lack of variety in game modes, no single player campaign elements to speak of and only two different bosses will cause any but the most loyal fans to walk away after a while. If you have a dedicated group to play semi often, there is plenty to enjoy here but without good friends to play with you will end up losing interest after 10-12 hours of the same thing on repeat. The games will play out differently each time, but you will inevitably either die midway through or face one of the two bosses that you will come to learn and know well after a few encounters.", "date": "December 5, 2016", "grade": "B"}
