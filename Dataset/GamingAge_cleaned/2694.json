{"name": "PUSS!", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/04/puss-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "PUSS! is, unquestionably, one of the strangest games Ive ever played.I mean, the gist of it is pretty straightforward: youre trying to help a cat escape another dimension. To do so, you help it rush through a series of very short levels whose order constantly changes, and if you touch a wall, you start the level over. And, naturally, since youre a cat, you have nine lives.But put that into practice, and it gets weird very quickly. PUSS! is drenched in dissonant music and vibrating neon colours. The levels dont just change order with every playthrough, nearly all of them involve mazes or paths whose shape and direction are constantly moving around. You have to move quickly to get through those shifting paths  because, again, you die when you touch the wall  except the controls have very little precision, so youre basically just hoping for the best at all times.Also, in keeping with the games title, there are cats of all shapes and sizes everywhere.Ive never done any drugs, but I get the feeling that this is what people mean when they talk about a bad trip.Because PUSS! is so odd, it feels like calling it good or bad is missing the point. This is the kind of game you should play when you really want something totally different, and you want your senses assaulted the whole time youre playing. It is what it is  and even though Ive always hated that phrase, its the most appropriate way to describe PUSS!", "date": "April 5, 2021", "grade": "C"}
