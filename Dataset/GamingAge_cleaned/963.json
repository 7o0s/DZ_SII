{"name": "Dear Esther: Landmark Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/11/dear-esther-landmark-edition-review-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "I went into Dear Esther with improbably high expectations. While Id consciously made an effort to hear as little about the game as possible  as I do with any narrative-focused experience  what little I did know centred around the fact that it was made by The Chinese Room, who were the team responsible for one of my favourite games of all time, Everybodys Gone To The Rapture (our review here). If that wasnt reason to be optimistic, I dont know what would be.Turns out I shouldve adjusted those expectations to account for the fact that Dear Esther was the game that preceded Everybodys Gone To the Rapture. Because really, thats the most salient fact about Dear Esther: while it certainly sets the stage for what The Chinese Room did in their later outing, thats really all it does. All the stuff that made Everybodys Gone To The Rapture great in my eyes is only here in embryonic form. The story, the music, the voice acting, the world: Dear Esther operates on a much smaller scale in every respect, causing it to feel more like an impressive demo than a full-on game.Admittedly, this isnt a failing on the part of the game so much as its a failing on my part to set appropriate expectations. In a vacuum, I dont think it could be said that Dear Esther is a bad game. The landscapes are appropriately foreboding, befitting a game thats all about mourning and loss. The voice acting is pretty good, which is important, seeing as theres only one speaker  voiced by Nigel Carrington  and its on him to carry the whole game in that regard. The plot is fine for what it is; one man, alone in isolation, exploring his grief isnt a topic that gets covered much in video games, so its easy to see why the game was so praised on its initial release.Having said all that, however, its plainly obvious how far the so-called walking simulator genre has come in the years since Dear Esther was released. Worlds like those in Everybodys Gone to the Rapture, Firewatch and Gone Home all feel so much more expansive. Each of them feel as if they take place in a living, breathing world, whereas Dear Esther frequently gives the impression that youre just moving along a preordained path. Youre never interacting with the world around you here; the most you can do is zoom in on certain objects to get a better look, but even doing that never leads to any greater discoveries or deeper understanding of the world. In fact, all zooming in really does is make plain how flat and unlifelike everything looks up close.", "date": "November 8, 2016", "grade": "B"}
