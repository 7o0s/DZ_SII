{"name": "Divekick", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/08/divekick-review-for-ps-vita-psn/", "text": "Im generally pretty bad at fighting games. While there have been a few Ive liked (Injustice and Marvel vs. Capcom 3 spring to mind) for the most part, the limits of my abilities only go as far as button-mashing will take meand in most cases, with the endless combos that usually need to be memorized, thats not very far.While I wouldnt say that Im good at Divekick, its the first fighting game Ive ever played where I wouldnt necessarily describe myself as horrible, either. This is because theres really not much to it: you jump, and you kick. You use two buttons the whole way through the game (menus included), there arent any combos to memorize, and every match ends after the first hit (or up to 20 seconds, whichever comes first).I can understand the temptation to look at that and think the game is just a joke. After all, Divekick is filled with plenty of those  probably even more than I realize, given my total unfamiliarity with the fighting game community. On top of that, the characters are all kind of silly, the graphics bring to mind 80s cartoons (which makes the game retro, but not in the way youd expect from a retro game), and the whole thing, at times, seems like its just a parody, an extended in-joke for people who like Street Fighter and King of Fighters a little more than is healthy.Beneath all the silliness and the simplicity, however, youll find that Divekick actually places a premium on timing, reflexes and strategic thinking. I mean, yes, you could rush into each match, hopping and kicking and hoping to connect with your opponent; you might even get a few wins that way. But after playing a few matches with a few different characters, youll quickly realize that each character has their own individual jumping and kicking styles  and consequently, each character requires you to approach their matches in different ways. Not only that, you soon find that while the game may not require you to pull off endless combos, you still need to jump and kick at just the right moment if you want to win. It may sound easy, but its really not  particularly against tougher opponents.That said, Divekick isnt flawless. The hit detection seems a little wonky at times; I had several matches where I was sure Id hit my opponent, only for the match to continue on (or, worse, for my opponent to turn around and kick me for the win). Additionally, the single-player mode feels a little boring after awhile; like most games that rely on competition, Divekick will live and die by the strength of its online community, and at this stage  writing, as I am, before its official launch  there arent enough other people online to tell how that part of the game will work out.", "date": "August 20, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
