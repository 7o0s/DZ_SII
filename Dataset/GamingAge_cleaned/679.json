{"name": "Royal Frontier", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/09/royal-frontier-review-for-playstation-xbox-switch-pc/", "text": "Its hard not to look at Royal Frontier and immediately think of The Oregon Trail. Maybe its lazy to look at a game where youre leading your party across a wild frontier and immediately think of one of the forefathers of the genre, but it feels like the obvious comparison here applies at least somewhat.Mind you, its not a one to one comparison, which youll notice right off the bat, seeing as one of the caravans escorts is a mage. Moreover, alongside the usual wild animals and diseases that can harm you, youre also fighting off goblins, orcs, and wizards. So, if nothing else, the comparison becomes The Oregon Trail with a heavy dose of fantasy.And then you factor in the strategy and roguelike elements, and you (or at least I) realize that theres a lot more here going on than simply an update to a 40-year-old game.However you want to look at Royal Frontier, though, its a pretty enjoyable game. You start off with a trio of heroes (mage, healer, warrior), you unlock a few more skills, you die fairly quickly, and then you start a new run with some of the new skills. Its far from complicated and its not very long (particularly once youve built your heroes up) but thats just part of the charm. Because its so straightforward, its hard to not want to start up a new run the moment your last one ends.That said, there are a few quirks that mean that Royal Frontier isnt quite as good as it could be. Most notably, the battles are a little annoying  you pick your action, but then you have to press X just at the right moment in order to maximize your strength. Its the same thing for defending, with well-timed press being the difference between losing a ton of HP and only losing a little. Eventually you get used to the constant QTEs, but its still a little annoying.Theres also the fact that this is published by Ratalaika, which means you have a Platinum popping long, long before youre done with the game. Obviously, having an easy Platinum trophy isnt the worst crime a game can commit, but it still takes away some of the incentive to play Royal Frontier all the way through.And Royal Frontier is enjoyable enough  and short enough  that its worth playing through. Its fun to see a game adding new elements to a well-worn formula, and it makes this game an easy recommendation.", "date": "September 22, 2022", "grade": "B+"}
