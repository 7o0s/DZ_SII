{"name": "Rayman Legends", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/02/rayman-legends-review-for-playstation-4/", "text": "A year ago we were told that Rayman Legends was being put on hold thanks to poor Wii U numbers. Ubisoft decided to shoot for a multiplatform release that would be driven by holiday sales, and now just a few days shy of last years announced delay, Rayman Legends is seeing its second release on the PS4 and Xbox One.We checked it out on Sonys console, and thought you may have some questions about that, so lets try to answer them.As gorgeous as Rayman looks on the Wii U and fellow platforms, theres logic behind assuming that more powerful hardware lead to a prettier product. At least, the advertised uncompressed textures on 3D models in the PS4/Xbox One versions suggest that were in for a treat although one which is frustratingly difficult to discern when I ran an A/B comparison between it and the Wii U edition. In fact, Digital Foundry has gone ahead and cleared it up for everyone that we dont need glasses, but in fact its nearly impossible to improve Raymans visuals even on new hardware. With no perceivable difference in fidelity, theres no reason to worry about having an inferior PS3 copy.Inferior isnt just a sarcastic jab, either. Unlike the majority of ports that Rayman Legends has seen, the PS4 version is closest to emulating the inventive touch controls that were showcased on the Wii U, by use of the Dualshock 4s touch pad. Its not much, but if its the thought that counts, then players will enjoy using the touchpad to physically scratch off cards along with functionality as a camera which can be zoomed for taking screenshots. Considering that the game is ostensibly a work of art, theres at least a small treat of appreciating it similar to the luxury of smelling the roses in any racing games photo mode.Theres also the bonus of remote play, which arguably means that youre getting a free game to play on your Vita, as with any PS4 release. Surprisingly, the ability to scratch off cards is present by use of the Vitas touch screen, further cementing the handhelds competency to play console games.These small touches not being present on the Xbox One version, of course, are the better arguments to side with Sony unless the 10 extra challenges the Xbox One gets sound more valuable to you. Additional character costumes from Assassins Creed are present on the PS4 version, with Far Cry 3 and Splinter Cell stuff on Microsofts console. Outside of these additions, theres not much else going on that we hadnt seen in the PS3/Xbox 360 variances of Rayman Legends.", "date": "February 21, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
