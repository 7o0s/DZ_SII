{"name": "Little Orpheus", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/10/little-orpheus-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc-playstation-xbox/", "text": "As the creators of Everybodys Gone To The Rapture and Dear Esther, The Chinese Room are one of the few developers who could convincingly argue that they helped create an entire genre. There were certainly better walking simulators  albeit not very many  but its not an understatement to call The Chinese Rooms first two games genre-defining.Now theyre back with Little Orpheus, and it turns out its a lot harder to be genre-defining when your genre  in this case, puzzle-platformer  is already pretty well-defined.Obviously, expecting Little Orpheus to drastically change what youd expect from puzzle-platformers would be a bit much. The genre is far too well-established for that. But whats striking is how it doesnt even make an effort to be interesting, gameplay-wise. Most levels feature little more than walking left to right across the screen, with the occasionally extremely easy puzzle, or a chase sequence where you have to stay one step ahead of your pursuer. I wouldnt go so far as to say its a bad game, but I would say that if you were judging it solely on how it plays, youd be justified in calling it painfully boring.Of course, this being The Chinese Room, the game has a couple of saving graces. First and foremost, its gorgeous. The game has occasionally described itself as technicolour, and its bright, somewhat gaudy colours really do echo the earliest colourized movies. Everything pops off the screen, so even when the gameplay is dull, you can still enjoy whats going on in the background.Similarly, as youd expect from developers who made their name with narrative storytelling, Little Orpheus is built around a pretty fun story. Set in the mid-60s, the game is the tale of a Soviet cosmonaut, Comrade Ivan Ivanovich, explaining to his superior how he lost an atomic bomb on his journey to the centre of the Earth. Its an absurd tale featuring dinosaurs, monsters, and lost civilizations, and the voiceovers of the two characters are enough to make it enjoyable.In other words, Little Orpheus two strong points are the same as the strong points from The Chinese Rooms other two games. The thing is, here theyve added a third element  platforming  thats not nearly as compelling, and its enough to make the game a far cry from their previous standard.", "date": "October 4, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
