In my defense, its not as if there have been a tonne of Western releases in the series  2018s Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum n Fun was the first North American release in more than a decade (after 2004s Taiko: Drum Master), so Rhythm Adventure Pack represents just the third game in this prolific series to reach our shores.Given those subtitles, it shouldnt surprise you to learn that these are rhythm games. It probably also wont surprise you that these games look and sound very much like youd expect Japanese arcade rhythm games to look and sound. You play as pair of sentient, cute taiko drums, you battle all kinds of cutesy monsters, and your fights feature lots of flashing lights. Did I mention the series started in Japanese arcades?That said, theres a lot more depth in Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack than youll find in most rhythm games. Both games included here  imaginatively named Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure and Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure 2  have pretty healthy RPG components. There are plots (however thin they may be, involving time travel and evil scientists), theres exploration, and theres shopping for goods. You even manage your party, Pokemon-style, by capturing monsters and then deploying them in your musical battles. Theres a lot more here than just a whole bunch of songs.Unfortunately, Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack is still held back by a few flaws. First, even in easy mode, you encounter a lot of enemies as youre exploring the map. Second  and very much related to the previous point  even though the game brags of featuring more than 130 songs, you end up hearing many of the same songs over and over again in your battlefield encounters. It doesnt matter whether you have a healthy appetite for J-pop, youre going to get sick of these songs pretty quickly.Ill also add that many of the fights are kind of unsatisfying. The battles end when you knock your opponents out  and, particularly early on, you can finish off opponents pretty quickly, which means the songs end just as they get going.Even with those flaws, though, Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack offers a fun dip into a series that hasnt had much exposure on this side of the Pacific. Theres more depth here than in most rhythm games, which means that its awfully easy to get sucked in  and provided you dont mind hearing some of the same music over and over again, thats definitely not a bad thing.", "date": "June 4, 2021", "grade": "B"}
