{"name": "Jak & Daxter Collection", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/jak-daxter-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "To hear some people talk, youd think that the Jak & Daxter Collection was the most hideous thing ever. That it was some Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault or Silent Hill HD Collection-level abomination that was cheaply ported over to the Vita, with only minimal improvements (or, more accurately, total downgrades) made in terms of how it looks.As far as Im concerned, though, some people are wrong. While the Jak & Daxter Collection certainly isnt the prettiest game on the Vita, to my (admittedly far less discerning) eye, it looks just fine. Better than the originals did on the PS2, not quite as good as the collection looks on the PS3  in other words, in terms of graphics it occupies pretty much the exact spot youd expect it to.Which isnt to say the Collection was ported over perfectly. For one thing its slightly buggy  I had the game crash on me a couple of times during the course of my time with it, which is a couple of times more than Ive ever had any other Vita games crash. That said, the bugginess is possibly something that could just be chalked up to random flukes, so I dont want to condemn the game on that basis.Its a little more difficult, however, to dismiss problems with the games controls. To be blunt: the controls for all three games here are kind of atrocious. Moving the camera around is a massive chore, and my point of view would routinely get stuck in the most awkward position possible  sometimes giving me extreme close-ups of Jak and/or Daxter, sometimes getting stuck behind a wall or a tree, sometimes zooming so far out I could barely tell what I was supposed to be doing. Compounding that was the fact that Jak II or Jak III make use of the rear touchpad to switch to a first person viewpoint. While this is certainly a neat way of updating the game to make use of the Vitas unique controls, unfortunately a) theres nothing in the game telling you this feature exists, b) its awfully prone to switching over at random (and inopportune) times, and c) theres no way to turn the feature off. Needless to say, combining wonky camera movement with poorly implemented touchpad features makes for an experience that can, at times, be awfully frustrating.", "date": "July 2, 2013", "grade": "B"}
