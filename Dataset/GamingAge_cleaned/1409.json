It was very good when it debuted on the 3DS a few years ago. It showed it worked just as well on consoles as it did on handhelds when it arrived on PS4 and PC (along with the Vita) last year. And now its on the Xbox One, and, unsurprisingly, its still very good.Dont mistake my lack of enthusiasm for a dislike of the game itself. Indeed, everything I wrote a year ago still stands. Steamworld Dig still features a core mechanic  digging  thats easy to pick up but difficult to master. And it still exists in a richly-imagined steampunk-influenced robot world, in which a western-style ghost town exists over a vast underground that hides all kinds of secrets.Of course, this means that the few criticisms of the original game still apply, too. Steamworld Dig can get a little repetitive, if youre not into the whole endless digging thing. And theres still not much of a story, if thats the sort of thing youre after.", "date": "June 19, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
