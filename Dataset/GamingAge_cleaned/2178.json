{"name": "Rover Mechanic Simulator", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/03/rover-mechanic-simulator-review-for-xbox-series-x-one-ps4-switch/", "text": "Rover Mechanic Simulator is kind of an odd duck, as job simulators go.In my experience, the very best ones work because they get you into a pleasant, zen-like rhythm. Whether youre cleaning up train stations or tending a farm, you quickly discover theres something soothing about the repetition of it all. You do a task, then another, then another, before going back to the first one and starting the cycle anew. The jobs (at least in the games) dont require a lot of thinking, so you can just zone out and relax.Rover Mechanic Simulator isnt quite like that. Youre still doing the same job over and over again  in this case, repairing Mars rovers  but its a bit more challenging than picking up trash or farming a field. You need to carefully scan each new rover that comes in, analyzing all the individual parts to figure out where the problems lie. Sometimes you need to clean parts up, other times you need to replace them  and because there are so many tiny bits and pieces, it requires a lot more focus and attention to detail.Admittedly, its still not an insane challenge or anything. Its more detail-oriented than some of its peers, to be sure, but youre really just seeking out problems, then using tools like brushes and 3D printers that fix them for you. The game doesnt hold your hand like it does in other simulators  and each job finishes up with a circuit connection puzzle  but you wont exactly need advanced education in robotics to figure things out.But Id be lying if I said I enjoyed Rover Mechanic Simulator as much as I do some of those other simulators. Its harder to get in one of those grooves where you just lose all track of time  and not being able to do that means youre constantly aware that youre just completing mundane, time-consuming tasks over and over again. That might be the joy of some of the better simulators, but here it just feels like a chore.", "date": "March 18, 2022", "grade": "C+"}
