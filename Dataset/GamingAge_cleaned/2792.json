{"name": "Reflection of Mine", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/12/reflection-of-mine-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Reflection of Mine is one of the most surprising games Ive played this year. Not because its shockingly good or anything  though its certainly more than passable  but rather, because its a Ratalaika release thats both challenging and long. As much as Im a fan of the publisher, those arent two adjectives Id usually use to describe their games.In fact, thinking more broadly, Reflection of Mine is also surprising in that its got surprisingly dark subject matter for a puzzle game. Its the story of a young girl with dissociative identity disorder, and the puzzles represent the fractured pieces of her mind and personality trying to come back together. Theres suicide references very early on, and the whole thing is much more intense than youd expect from your typical puzzle game.The gameplay isnt nearly as shocking or revolutionary, but it still ties in nicely with the subject matter. Youre controlling two characters at the same time, and you need to help both of them avoid the many traps and pitfalls on either side of the screen. It requires you to pay careful attention to everything going on, and youll die pretty regularly if and when your attention stays focused too much on one side or the other. There are occasional save points to get you through the harder levels, and youll almost certainly need them  since this game gets pretty challenging pretty quickly.", "date": "December 10, 2020", "grade": "B"}
