{"name": "Mysteries Under Lake Ophelia", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/08/mysteries-under-lake-ophelia-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Last time we covered a game developed by Bryce Bucher, it was Fatum Betula, a baffling experience that looked like it could have been first released 25 years ago for the first PlayStation. Hes returned with Mysteries Under Lake Ophelia  and, once again, its an  odd game that looks and plays like it couldve come out back in the late 90s. However, even though the two games both owe a huge debt of gratitude to PS1, and both are odd, its important to note that theyre quite different from each other. Where Fatum Betula felt like a stream-of-consciousness fever dream, Mysteries Under Lake Ophelia is actually just a fishing game. It drops you in the wilderness and leaves you to figure out everything on your own, but at its heart, the game is all about casting your line and reeling in fish. That said, calling Mysteries Under Lake Ophelia just a fishing game undersells just how strange it is. For one thing, its fairly unsettling. After your first day, a creepy-looking man shows up at your campsite and makes a few vaguely threatening jokes. He turns out to be the games shopkeeper, so he serves a purpose, but seeing as there are no other people in the game, he comes off as pretty odd. Youll also come across some strange happenings as youre out fishing, especially at night. I wont spoil any of them  to the extent the game can be spoiled, because theres not much of a plot  but needless to say, they make the whole thing awfully creepy.And, of course, there are the fish themselves. You may start out by catching tuna and bass, but its not long until you find yourself fishing for much, much stranger fish. Again, I dont want to give away too much, but youll quickly discover that the titular lake is home to fish that you dont usually see outside of the depths of the deepest oceans  to say nothing of one fish that Im quite certain doesnt even exist. While the fish dont lead to some grand reveal, their mere presence is still enough to underline how different this is from your usual fishing game.Of course, that makes it harder to say who this game is actually for. As fishing games go, theres not a lot here  you have one location, and youre essentially grinding your way through as many fish as you can in order to upgrade your equipment. Likewise, its not really a horror game, however unsettling it may be  there are hints of something darker and more sinister, but I wouldnt call Mysteries Under Lake Ophelia scary, by any stretch (though, to be fair, you do get an ending thats bonkers even by this developers standards). Basically, its an odd game about fishing that looks like a leftover from another generation, so if thats what youre after, you may be pleasantly surprised by what you find here.", "date": "August 16, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
