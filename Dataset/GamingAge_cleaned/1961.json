{"name": "Rise of the Triad", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/08/rise-of-the-triad-review-for-pc/", "text": "OH SNAP. What is it about remakes and reboots these days? OH right, capitalizing on a built-in audience leading to  presumably  more sales. Its kind of funny though, because I dont remember too many people actually playing RotT beyond the shareware version and for those that did it quickly got overshadowed by the top dogs (Doom, then Duke, then Quake). Two things stuck out for me though  it had those kick ass jump pads and it was the first FPS I can remember that actually had dual pistols which, during the mid-90s John Woo-influenced action era, was the cats ass Then, of course, Max Payne came out and set the standard. Im digressing, I know, but the problem is the recent remake of Rise of the Triad is essentially a straight-up remake. Like it feels the same and basically looks the same (no, not really, but kind of).In fact, the only thing that has been changed is the presentation, and it is NOT for the better. The comic book style intro cutscene almost seems like its going to be good, but then it actually starts and youre sitting there wondering if the cheese was intentionally bad, or just bad-bad. Whatever they paid for voice acting was too much Wait, maybe it wasnt the voice acting, but definitely the dialogue editing. Lines read way slower than the comic book thought-bubbles come up, so youve essentially read through the two or three words/sentences, and then some way too over the top dudes/chicks say the lines with long beats in delivery. Its wicked bad, but fortunately only lasts a couple of minutes And its skippable, but then you wouldnt know the games thought provoking premise (kidding, of course).The story goes that a cult has taken over an Island off the coast of California, and its up to the futuristic HUNT unit  High-risk United Nations Task-force  to do some recon and find out what theyre up to. Upon arrival to the island, the HUNT teams boat is destroyed and their only course of action is to fight their way through the base and put an end to the Triad, who are hell bent on world domination.RotT, then and now, allows you to choose from one of five HUNT characters, each with their own characteristics. Realistically the game doesnt hinge on any of these characteristics (although I think certain secrets areas can only be accessed by characters that jump higher or run faster). What makes the game fun/different is the gib-factor; RotT is about straight-up fragging. Enemies dumb and basically explode on bullet impact and the game is more about racking up points than making it to the end of a stage. There are coins to collect and you get awarded higher points for combo killing, headshots, and the like. Plus the power-ups are awesome  two words: dog mode.Like a lot of games of early/mid-90s, Rise of the Triad plays *really* fast. As in, Nelle piattaforme legali e possibile sfruttare tantissime slot online aams ed ovviamente sono molti i casinos Italia slot gratis presenti in questo momento sul mercato. maybe a little too fast. If youre used to playing Haloz and/or COD this game probably wont be your cup of tea. I wouldnt say its a twitch shooter, more like a circle strafe shooter. Which makes sense, as RotT bridged the gap between Wolfenstein 3D and Doom (actually it was originally supposed to be a level pack for W3D.) Multiplayer definitely plays better on a mouse and keyboard, but the AI in single player is pretty easy to dominate regardless of the controls used. That reminds me, the big change to the controls this time out is that there is freelook, something that the original game didnt have. Huzzah!Unfortunately thats where the innovation stops. Like the original SP bosses are their own breed of annoying. It takes too long to kill them and their stacked with devastating weapons. Whats worse is that the reason theyre so difficult isnt because theyre particularly clever or require a cool takedown method, but rather that they can take so much damage  in other words its a false sense of difficulty, which equals frustration. Similarly aggravating is the save system, which is actually a step backwards  no saving and checkpoints absurdly far apart  and the slew of jump-puzzle death traps. Its bad enough that youre playing find the key to unlock the door missions, but when you have mind numbingly difficult traps to navigate followed by insta-death bosses, it gets more than a little bothersome.", "date": "August 19, 2013", "grade": "D"}
