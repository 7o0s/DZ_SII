{"name": "Pizza Titan Ultra", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/12/pizza-titan-ultra-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Theres a limit to how critical I can be of Pizza Titan Ultra. After all, its a game where you pilot giant mechs around a destructible city, delivering pizza and pretty much destroying everything in your path. To steal and adapt an old-ish saying, games about giant, pizza-delivering mechs destroying buildings are like pizza: even when theyre bad, theyre still pretty good.Of course, thats kind of a stupid saying, since Ive definitely had terrible, cardboard-like pizza. And even if I wouldnt say that Pizza Titan Ultra is that bad, I dont think Id ever describe it as pretty good, either.Its one of those games that sounds better on paper than it does in practice. Or, more accurately, its a game where the main idea is interesting, but playing the game for any length of time quickly shows that the developers didnt really take it any further than the one-sentence description. Pizza Titan Ultra tries to build something around its one-note elevator pitch with different characters calling in orders and switching up the environments every few chapters, but it generally feels like youre just doing the same thing over and over again.Admittedly, that same thing is pretty fun, particularly in small doses. I dont know about you, but Ill always be able to find the time to smash buildings and crush my enemies with the power of a giant robot. Its hard not to feel a little giddy as you punch helicopters out of the sky, or run through a neighbourhood and flatten every single thing in your path, or stomp on tanks. Its also kind of fun to come across random people who want pizza, and then you make, bake, and slice it for them on the spot. In its own, limited way, Pizza Titan Ultra delivers on what it promises.But, ultimately, whatever joy you may derive from the game is going to be pretty short-lived; punching helicopters a couple of times is a blast, whereas punching them over and over again starts feeling repetitive after not too long. If you go in expecting to just play for a couple of minutes in between other, probably better games, Pizza Titan Ultra will do, but otherwise its not going to be as fun as it promises.", "date": "December 3, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
