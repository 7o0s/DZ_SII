{"name": "Crimsonland", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/07/crimsonland-review-ps4/", "text": "For the life of me, I cant figure why Crimsonland needed to be revived. I get that the PS4 is selling well, and that people are into retro and indie games at the moment, and all those other sales-associated reasons that may exist. Whats more, I get the pull of nostalgia when it comes to gaming  I have fond memories of all sorts of NES and SNES games, even though Im fairly certain most of my favourites were probably objectively horrible. So Im not saying that Crimsonland shouldnt exist, or that I cant understand why anyone would like it.Except, wellI kind of am. I mean, the original Crimsonland only came out a little over a decade ago, and theres no way people didnt have higher standards than this back in 2003. It looks awful, the gameplay is stale and repetitive, and the whole thing seems like it wouldven barely passed muster as an Atari 2600 game. Its not a particularly good game, and that would be the case whether it was 2014, 2004, 1994 or 1984.I will say this, though: it might have the most literal title of any game Ive ever played. After all, it consists entirely of shooting bugs, zombies, aliens, etc., and leaving the ground (or land!) stained red (or crimson!) with their blood  hence, Crimsonland.With that kind of originality, I guess I shouldnt be too surprised that theres nothing very interesting going on here. As I said, the whole game consists of you moving slowly around a big, empty field, shooting all the enemies that pop into view. You do this with a top-down view of said empty field. Theres not really any story, theres barely any variety, and you just do the same thing over and over again.Now, I have nothing against running around shooting bugs/other enemies over and over again in a game with atrocious plotting. Heck, thats basically a description of one of my favorite franchises. But at least the EDF series knows how to ramp everything up to absolutely absurd levels. Crimsonland, by contrast, just strips all the fun out of it. You dont move around very quickly, your weapons all feel strangely underpowered, and the upgrades dropped by enemies only provide brief respites from both of these flaws. Whats more, you dont even get the visceral thrill of seeing your enemies get blown to pieces, EDF-style. Thanks to the games severely primitive graphics, you just get little red splotches, which add with the other red splotches to make a giant red splotch.", "date": "July 30, 2014", "grade": "D"}
