Her observation?Its crazy how Nintendo did all this stuff 25 years ago, and people are still making games like it today.While thats a slightly reductionist take on the history of platformers, the basic sentiment behind it pretty much nails everything there is to know about Cloudberry Kingdom. Its a game that, for better or for worse, owes a huge debt of gratitude to Super Mario Bros., and makes no effort whatsoever to hide that fact.Actually, Im not sure why I included for worse there, because Cloudberry KIngdoms take on the platforming genre is pretty much all great. It doesnt try and bog the game down in gimmicks or innovations: it gives you a princess to save, drops you at the beginning of a level, and sets you on your side-scrolling way. It doesnt have flashy graphics or complicated controls. The only way it could be more SMB-ish would be if you were a plumber instead of a scruffy, weird-looking superhero-type guy.Well that, and it would have to be way, way easier. Because thats the one really significant way that this game differs from those of yesteryear: it piles on the difficulty to the point of insanity. I know its customary to say that old games are harder than modern ones, but when Cloudberry Kingdom really gets going, the only thing I can compare it to is that level from Battletoads. In both story mode and arcade mode, the levels just keep adding more and more moving platforms and rotating balls of death and spikes and massive gaps, and if you stop for a moment to think about what youre doing, you die in a fiery explosion. This game is all about good timing and quick reflexes, and if you have either of those qualities in short supply, youll die a lot.", "date": "August 9, 2013", "grade": "A"}
