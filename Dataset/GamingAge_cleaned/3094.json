I mean, its a rhythm-based beat em up thats not as rhythmic as it should be, its a single-player game with offline-only leaderboards, and the Switch version abandoned one of the games big selling points on PC, which was that you could import your own music. And yet, despite all these things, I feel strangely fond towards the game.Some of this can probably be explained by how much I love the music in Terrorhythm (or TRRT, as the game occasionally calls itself). Every single track here is big and thumping and geared towards making you want to move. WIthin seconds of starting up the first level, I found myself bopping along in my seat, and that set the tone for every other level. If youre going to build your game around music, making that music awesome is a pretty great step.On top of that, Terrorhythm is just oozing style. Its brightly-coloured, things are flashing around the screen at all times, and it just all perfectly fits in with the tone the music is trying to set. Add in the fact that the main character, who stands in the middle of the screen and fights off waves of incoming enemies in time with the music, moves incredibly smoothly, and you can see why its easy to get sucked in to the games whole flashy aesthetic.But all this flash obscures some pretty clear problems. The first is that, for a game built around attacking to the beat, it sure is difficult sometimes to tell exactly where the beats are. This is partly a function of the enemies coming intermittently rather than continuously; when youre fighting off the bad guys, its easy enough to tell exactly where the beat is and whether youre hitting it. During the lulls, however, youre almost forced to guess where the beat is  and it doesnt help that theres some pretty significant lag going on. Even after going into the settings and adjusting the calibration, I found that the games registering of my button clicks varied pretty wildly, which made it hard to know exactly what was expected of me.It also felt like the game was lacking in feedback. Sure, it would tell me when I lost a combo, and at the end of each level it would say how I did overall  say, 137 hits to 3 misses  but that didnt feel like enough. Compare that to your standard rhythm game, where it ranks your hits from dead-on to merely okay, and you can see why pass/fail doesnt seem like as good a metric.Lastly, Im not going to pretend it mattered that much to me and my offline-only self, but it does seem like this game missed a few opportunities as far as bells and whistles go. There are no community leaderboards, for starters, which makes the whole act of keeping local leaderboards seem kind of silly. You also cant add in your own songs  something you apparently can do on the PC version, and which has apparently led to a semi-thriving community, if Steam reviews are anything to go by.", "date": "January 21, 2020", "grade": "B"}
