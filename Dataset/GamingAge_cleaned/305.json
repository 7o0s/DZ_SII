I enjoyed Energy Invasion for what it was (that is, a Breakout clone), and Energy Balance wasnt too bad either (provided you like math and number problems). However, I had all kinds of trouble with the original Energy Cycle. Its all about how good you are at spatial logic puzzles, and as someone who is horrendous at those, I didnt have a whole lot of fun with it.It should come as no surprise, then, that Energy Cycles sequel, Energy Cycle Edge, wasnt much more enjoyable for me.In fact, in some ways, Energy Cycle Edge is even less accessible than its predecessor. Right off the bat, youre just presented with 44 puzzles, with nothing in the way of context or instruction. True, its not exactly a challenging mechanic to figure out  you have to change all the cells on the screen into one colour, which you achieve by clicking on parts of lines, and before long you have to rotate the puzzles on a three dimensional plane to get all of them  but the fact theres not even an introductory level means that, especially at first, youll be doing a lot of random clicking.Whats more, this game gets hard. Whereas Energy Cycle was renowned for being an easy Platinum, Energy Cycle Edge seems to want to make up for that by upping the difficulty significantly. Unless youre the sort of person who scoffs at Rubiks Cubes, when the puzzles here go 3D, youll probably be looking online for some guidance.Theres also the problem of a lack of variety. Energy Cycle didnt just have a standard puzzle mode, it also had Time Attack and Infinite Play, giving you a bit of variety. Energy Cycle Edge has none of those  here, its just puzzles. Obviously, given the challenge level, you may not want any more of these puzzles once youve finished the 44, but if you do, you wont get them here.Having said all that, Im fully aware that my perception of Energy Cycle Edge is skewed by the fact Im terrible at it. But at the same time, because its so lacking in variety and so intimidating right off the back, I suspect my experience with the game might be the most common one. If youre really into puzzles that push your brain, then by all means check this out, but otherwise, youll probably want to avoid Energy Cycle Edge.", "date": "January 14, 2019", "grade": "C"}
