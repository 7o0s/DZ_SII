This shouldnt be a surprise, since I loved it back when I first played it on Xbox, I want to make that clear right off the bat.And I said it first, because heres the other thing you need to know about Tropico 6 on the Switch: its rough.And I mean really, really rough. This is apparent right from the get-go, as soon as you start designing your character. Everything looks all grainy and washed-out, to the point that it looks like a game from a couple of generations ago. Whats more, it doesnt improve significantly once you start actually playing the game. Large items like buildings and fields are constantly popping in and out of existence, and you rarely get the feeling youre building up a tropical island paradise.On top of that, the performance isnt all that great. Load times take forever, and slowdowns are incredibly common. Im know Ive played games that run worse on the Switch, but there arent many of them.And yet, despite these flaws  and perhaps because I knew what the game was going for, thanks to having played it on another console  I still loved Tropico 6s Switch port. Not even lousy performance can completely erase all the things this game does well.For starters, as I noted in my review of the game from a few years ago, theres the way the game is structured. As fun as it is to build up your little piece of dictatorial heaven, its even more fun to play with the scenarios on offer here, ranging from throwing off oppressive colonizers to getting involved in the nuclear arms race.On top of that, like with its other console counterparts, the game doesnt suffer from the kind of menu bloat that can make it difficult to play city-building sims without a mouse and keyboard. Tropico 6 may take its time to allow you to do exactly what you want, but you can at least be confident that youll know what youre doing and how to do it.But again, theres only so much I can sugarcoat things. Tropico 6 is one of my favourite city-building games and Ill never say no to playing it on the go, but if youre interested in it, you need to know that the experience youre getting is a little rough  to put it mildly.", "date": "March 30, 2021", "grade": "B"}
