{"name": "Knytt Underground", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/01/knytt-underground-review-for-ps-vita-psn/", "text": "Knytt Underground issomething.I realize that outside of my house, that doesnt mean much, so I should probably give a little backstory. Basically, any time my wife or I come across something that leaves us more confused than anything, the go-to response is Well thatssomething. (The phrase Uh.huh is also acceptable.) Something is a descriptor that applies to anything that exists outside of the usual good/bad, awful/awesome dichotomy.And if ever Ive played a game that seems to exist in that difficult-to-classify grey area, Knytt Underground would be it. I mean, I have an opinion on it  I kind of hate it. Or, at least, I think I hate it. Its probably a mark of how confused the game leaves me that Ive played it for about a dozen hours now, and explored more rooms than I can count (literally, since the save system, and its total lack of autosave, means that I twice lost a substantial amount of progress), but I still cant tell for certain whether I like it or whether it makes me want to throw my Vita across the room.Thats not to say I dont like and dislike certain elements of Knytt Underground. Take the games art, for example: its gorgeous. Its got a neat style that could almost be accused of ripping off Limbo  in many places, youre basically playing in silhouette  if it werent for the fact that every so often youll come across dazzling, vibrant colours and images, things like luminescent flowers and glowing mushrooms, that are simply beautiful. Considering youre playing in a 2D cavern, thats quite an achievement.Also neat: the sheer size of the games world. Youre tasked with exploring a cavern that contains approximately 2,000 rooms, and a significant chunk of them require a combination of careful planning and luck in order to reach. With that kind of scope, its very easy to sink lots of time into the game, and you generally wont feel like youre doing the same thing over and over again.You will, however, wonder why youre doing it. Thats Knytt Undergrounds big, glaring flaw, as far as Im concerned: theres not much of a plot to speak of. Or, more accurately, there is (possibly?) one something to do with ringing bells of fate to stop the world from ending, if Google is leading me in the right direction, but the game does a horrendous job of explaining it. Things get mentioned in passing in conversation with characters you meet throughout the game, but theres no way of telling whats important to the story, and whats just a weird digression. Just like the game starts with your character in silhouette and no explanation of what youre supposed to do next (hint: exit to the right to get to the games title screen), if youre anything like me, youll constantly feel as though youre only getting snippets and fragments of something that may or may not be much larger. While that may be true to life, its not exactly conducive to making a coherent game.That said, I cant shake the nagging feeling that I might be looking at things the wrong way  that I might be looking for a linear plot when thats not supposed to be the focus of the game, and that all the random asides are there to be reminders of that fact. If thats the case, then trying to apply the usual This game is awesome!/This game sucks! labels just doesnt work. If youre supposed to focus on the simple joys of exploring and solving the occasional puzzle, rather than worrying about completing quests and finding items and ringing bells of fate, thenwell, then the game is an unqualified success, and Im just missing the point entirely. Though the converse is true, too  if creator Nicklas Nygren was trying to tell a story with Knytt Underground, he failed miserably.", "date": "January 4, 2013", "grade": "B"}
