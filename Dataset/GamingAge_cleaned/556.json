{"name": "MLB The Show 23", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/03/mlb-the-show-23-review-for-playstation-xbox/", "text": "Im trying really, really hard not to be cynical about MLB The Show 23. But its tough.In nearly every respect, this years edition is identical to MLB The Show 22. This is kind of obvious if you read through the list of improvements the developers are touting. While Im sure that plenty of work went into features like improving the throwing accuracy metre, enhancing swing feedback, and adding in more player animations, in practice the changes to the finished product seem negligible. There are more baseball legends and a few more classic stadiums, which play into the one big change in MLB The Show 23  that Ill get to in a little bit  but for the most part, what you see here is what you wouldve seen in MLB The Show 22.Its even more obvious, though, when you look at whats on offer here. March to October? The same. You pick a team, play through their key moments, and try to guide them to a World Series victory. Its a fun way to play an entire season, but theres nothing here we havent seen before.Franchise mode? Largely the same. Theres a little more depth when it comes to the annual MLB draft, but for the most part this just rehashes previous games. That means, of course, that theres still no option to add expansion teams, nor has the option for online franchises returned. But theres updated CBA and on-field rules, so if youre a fan of that runner on 2nd starting in the 11th inning, a) youre a monster, and b) youll be happy to know thats an option here.Road to the Show? Completely the same, though this year theyve brought back training exercises rather than making them weird minigames. While thats a good thing, I guess, as someone who has sunk hundreds  if not thousands  of hours into RTTS over the past decade, the whole mode feels pretty stale at this point. Compared to how every other sports game has found a way to make single-player careers feel dynamic and interesting, its deeply disappointing that we basically get the same thing year in and year out here. Just having your player answer the odd text message while a guy who sounds vaguely like Sam Elliott narrates a brief snippet of explanation really doesnt cut it anymore. On top of that, the fact that you once again cant carry over your created player from previous versions of the game makes it harder to feel like its worth investing time into this years version.Diamond Dynasty? Mostly the same, with the caveat Ive never been all that interested in the mode. There are more ways to earn new players and perks, including through situations from this years World Baseball Classic, but again, to someone whos never been a huge fan of the mode, it feels pretty tired overall.And while they dont count as a game mode unto themselves, its worth noting that Jon Boog Sciambi and Chris Singleton return for a second year as the voices of MLB The Show. And, for the second year in a row, I cant stand them. While I cant say Im clamouring for the return of Matt Vasgersian, at the very least the game didnt have him interjecting the same boring anecdotes every single time a player came up to bat. Its so bad that if you play the game in franchise mode, youll be lucky if you can make it to the second game in a three-game series before they start repeating themselves. The one new quirk of their dialogue this year is that they seem obsessed with telling you how big each player is, and there are only so many times you can hear someone tell you that Player X is so many feet tall and so many pounds.Theres only one part of MLB The Show 23 that doesnt feel like a tired retread  and its also why Im feeling a little cynical about the game. This year, for the first time ever, MLB The Show has added a Storylines mode, and theyre introducing it by using it to tell the story of the Negro Leagues. Or, at least, certain players from the Negro Leagues. The game offers you a chance to play moments in the careers of players like Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, Hilton Smith, and five other Negro League players (no Josh Gibson or Cool Papa Bell, mind you), and also has Negro Leagues Baseball Museum President Bob Kendrick offer little insights into their lives. Its a timely addition, coming a few years after Major League Baseball decided to recognize the Negro Leagues as a major league, and it gives players a glimpse into a part of baseball history that they may not be aware of. The thing isits not really all that different from the rest of the game, apart from the Kendrick interludes. In fact, in some ways its even less fleshed out. If you play as any of the pitchers, for example, the opposing batters only get announced by the last name. The stadiums, too, feel kind of lifeless and lacking in personality, and most of the moments are short and inconsequential. While the inclusion of these new players gives Sciambi and Singleton more opportunities for anecdotes, much like the rest of the game, youll probably get tired of hearing the same thing over and over again pretty quickly. In other words: its great that MLB The Show 23 has added Storylines, and its hard to think of a better way to have launched the mode than with the Negro Leagues  but its also hard not to think that their inclusion is a way of papering over how much it feels like the franchise is treading water at this point.To be fair, part of the reason it feels like MLB The Show 23 is treading water is that, for so many years, it was far and away the best sports game available. When you nail a sport so accurately, all thats left is the sort of tinkering around the edges that MLB The Show 23 does here. But unless you have a burning need to play as Satchel Paige  and who could blame you if you do?  it makes it really difficult to see why youd want to pick it up rather than just sticking with MLB The Show 22.", "date": "March 27, 2023", "grade": "B-"}
