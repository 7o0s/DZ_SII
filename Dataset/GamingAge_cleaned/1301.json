{"name": "Haven Park", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/07/haven-park-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "The problem with Haven Park is that its much too easy to think about it in terms of what its not. Its a game where youre playing as an animal and sprucing up an island to make it more attractive to visitors  but its not Animal Crossing. Likewise, its a cute game about a bird going through some family stuff (while, again, exploring an island)  but its not A Short Hike.Whatever Haven Park has going for it  and it does have its fair share of good qualities  having a distinctive identity isnt one of those things.Which is unfortunate, because its a pretty delightful game, once you get past how liberally it borrows from those other games. Playing as a yellow bird named Flint, youre trying to restore your grandmas campground/park to its former glory. That involves wandering around an island and gathering resources, then stumbling across old camp sites and adding in all the conveniences you can build. As a few campers show up, you can add more, but the demands are never so great that you feel like youre constantly in a cycle of resource-gathering and building.The other neat thing is that there are a few puzzles to solve and treasures to uncover. While none of them are particularly difficult, they give you a reason to explore the island beyond simply gathering more resources. While these little finds dont always necessarily impact the story in a meaningful way, they still give the island character and make it feel like Haven Park is more than just the gameplay loop mentioned above.The one drawback to the game  apart from how much it borrows from those other two games mentioned above  is that the map makes absolutely no sense. It only fills in areas once youve discovered a new campsite, which means that its kind of useless for figuring out where you are if youre in a new region of the island. While I understand the game doesnt want to spoil anything, at the same time, theres a massive chunk of the map that you cant uncover until youre at the very end of the story, and missing that chunk makes it very easy to get lost.But given how cute the game is and how short it is (you can easily finish it in a few hours), its hard to get too upset about a bit of aimless wandering. Haven Park isnt going to make you forget its influences  and you should definitely play those other games before playing this one, since theyre both much better  but its still enjoyable enough that if youve got a few hours to spare and want to play something charming and wholesome, itll do the trick.", "date": "July 12, 2022", "grade": "B+"}
