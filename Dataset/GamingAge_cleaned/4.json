{"name": "Super Box Land Demake", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/10/super-box-land-demake-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "I have a pretty simple way of figuring out how much I enjoy games published by Ratalaika: if I keep playing after I get the easy Platinum, I like it. If I quit the moment the Platinum pops, I dont. Hoggy 2 or Super Wiloo Demake? Got the Platinum, liked them enough to keep on playing. Gravity Duck or Paradox Soul? I closed them as the Platinum Trophy was popping.Super Box Land Demake is, unfortunately, an example of the latter. I pushed boxes around for about 45 minutes, got all the trophies, and then deleted it almost immediately.To be fair, its definitely better than either of the two middling-to-bad games I named in the first paragraph. Its a top-down puzzle game where you have to shift boxes around to unlock gates. While most of the levels are fairly easy, there were a couple where I had to think for a second before doing anything  though the fact the game also has a rewind button also allowed for plenty of trial and error.The thing is, theres nothing else to Super Box Land Demake. Like Super Wiloo Demake, its heavily indebted to the past in its look and feel; unlike Super Wiloo Demake, however, it doesnt do anything more than that. The levels really only feature different colour palettes, and the environments dont change all that much. They get a little trickier the further in you get, but theres no way any of these are going to stump you, even if youre not particularly good at solving puzzles.", "date": "October 23, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
