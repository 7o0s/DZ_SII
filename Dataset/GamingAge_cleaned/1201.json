{"name": "Freddy Spaghetti 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/07/freddy-spaghetti-2-review-for-playstation-xbox-switch-pc/", "text": "Freddy Spaghetti 2 is a weird game  but probably not in the way it wants to be.See, much like its predecessor, its a game about a sentient(?) piece of spaghetti. Youre responsible for making it move around  since, in the tradition of games like I Am Bread, naturally the spaghetti is mobile. Thats not the weird part, though.Where the first game was basically just a bunch of levels thrown together with no overarching theme, Freddy Spaghetti 2 has a story, of sorts. Its a parody of The Office, complete with a bargain basement version of that shows iconic theme and confessionals from other characters. This, strangely enough, also isnt the weird part about Freddy Spaghetti 2.Rather, whats weird is that the developers clearly put a lot more effort into this Office parody than they did the actual gameplay. The game is broken up into a couple of dozen very short levels, very few of which go longer than thirty seconds. In between each level you get those aforementioned confessionals, and they often last longer than the levels themselves. Whats more, theyre probably more entertaining than the levels  though thats usually because the levels are so uninspired, generally consisting of flinging the eponymous pasta hero across the floor for a few seconds. While I wouldnt say any of the confessionals really stood out, they at least make an effort of doingwell, anything, which is more than can be said about the levels.Because, seriously, some of these levels dont even try. Theres one level where you just sit in a fishtank for thirty seconds  and then the level is revisited again later in the game, for some reason. For every mildly interesting level, like one where you have to move a box across a room (as I said, mildly interesting), you have ones where you do nothing more than move a few feet across the floor, or go up or down a flight of stairs.As I said, Freddy Spaghetti 2s existence is weird. It feels as if the developers wanted to make a different, more interesting game, but couldnt figure out what they wanted to do with it, so instead they turned it into a sequel for a game that wasnt particularly good or memorable in the first place. Youre left with the feeling that they didnt really care about Freddy Spaghetti 2  and really, neither should you.", "date": "July 22, 2022", "grade": "C-"}
