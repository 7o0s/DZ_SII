{"name": "Jazzpunk: Directors Cut", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/11/jazzpunk-directors-cut-review-ps4/", "text": "Outside of maybe sex, I dont think theres anything harder for games to get right than humour. I know Im not saying anything new here, but its something worth remembering when it comes to Jazzpunk. After all, were talking about something thats hugely subjective; what one person finds hilarious may leave someone else completely cold.That goes double for a game like Jazzpunk, whose sense of humour is fairlyidiosyncratic, to put it mildly. Its a spoof of Cold War-era spy movies set in a world of robots, and thats just about the most straightforward thing about it. Jazzpunk is a game where, for example, at one point youll need to collect five spiders to throw at a restaurant owner, so that you can sneak into the kitchen, steal a pufferfish, and spray its juices onto sushi in order to steal someones kidney.It is, to say the least, weird. And its aggressively weird, too. Its not afraid to let its robotic freak flag fly, in a way that may be off-putting to anyone who doesnt share in its off-kilter sense of humour.If you do share Jazzpunks sense of humour, though, this game will seem like a dream come true. Youll love uncovering all the weird little sidequests and Easter Eggs it has to offer, whether its spoofs of games like Doom and Wave Race, minigames built around combing beaches with metal detectors, or talking boxes. Youll also be disappointed when you realize that the whole game can be beaten and all its trophies achieved in about three hours or less.Of course, if you dont share Jazzpunks appreciation for the wacky and random, those three hours will seem like an eternity. Like I said, what one person finds hilarious, another will find just plain stupid. Personally, I fall somewhere between those two extremes, which is why I may sound a little circumspect in my description of the game. There are undeniably parts that cracked me up, but there were also jokes that just didnt land for me.", "date": "November 2, 2016", "grade": "B"}
