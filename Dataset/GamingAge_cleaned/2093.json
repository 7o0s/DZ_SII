{"name": "MUD  FIM Motocross World Championship", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/03/mud-fim-motocross-world-championship-review-for-ps3-xbox-360/", "text": "I hate to harp on one games failings in a review for another, but heres how I know that Fuel Overdose was terrible: it makes MUD  FIM Motocross World Championship look like one of the best racing games ever by comparison, when the objective reality is that MUD isnt anywhere close to being that good.Not to say that its a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. Indeed, MUD is a solidly above-average racer whose positives make it easy to recommend. I just wouldnt say that its going to be gracing many GOTY lists for anyone other than people who really love motocross.But enough about what MUD isnt. Lets focus on what it is, since its got quite a few things going in its favour. The graphics, for example, are fantastic, and make the game far more colourful and bright than youd expect from a game where youre racing around in the dirt. This vibrance, in turn, means that the tracks each have their own unique personalities  again, no small feat, considering that the racing surfaces themselves dont differ all that much.Most importantly, though, the motorbikes handle extremely well. MUDs tracks are filled with sharp corners and jumps that require pretty precise timing, and the controls never once let me down. Maybe its just easier for developers to make motorbikes that arent too drifty or prone to flipping out (as compared to, say, racecars), but I was consistently impressed by the fact that my drivers (cyclists?) always did exactly what I wanted them to do.As I said, though, MUD is far from perfect  though I should acknowledge right away that some of the games flaws are only really flaws if you share my ideological outlook. Case in point: Im kind of appalled by the amount of advertising splashed throughout the game. I understand that thats the nature of modern sports, and that any true-to-life sports game almost has to have ads in it by necessity, but when the very first screen in the game has a Monster Energy Drink ad prominently placed, that seems like it crosses some kind of line.Another ideological problem I have with the game? The fact its so overwhelmingly male. I mean, I get that males are probably an overwhelming majority when it comes to both motocross participants and MUDs target demographic, but, like the advertising, it seems a little excessive. All four of the characters available in career mode are male, and all the music is by male artists. A quick Google search reveals that female motocross racers do exist (heck, the FIM half of titular MUD-FIM apparently even has a female division), so it seems kind of needlessly exclusionary that its not even an option to race as a woman.There are also a few issues with the game that have nothing to do with politics. First and foremost, every so often the game seems to hiccup. It doesnt happen so much that it could be considered a game-breaker, but it still happens often enough in both online and offline modes that it seems fair to label it an annoyance. My one other minor annoyance: its really easy to lose sight of your racer when youre in a crowd. All it takes is one or two other racers crowding near you, and suddenly youre racing on blind faith for a few moments.", "date": "March 18, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
