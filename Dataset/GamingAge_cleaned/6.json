I got it back when it first came out on PS3 in 2012, and I made the mistake of playing it immediately after finishing the first Darksiders. As I remember it, the very, very early stages of the game put me off, with the rolling green hills and flute-heavy score giving me far too much of a Lord of the Rings vibe. I played it for a short time, didnt like it at all, and traded it in.This is why Im so glad the game has been re-released for current gen systems, because its given me time and perspective to realize that Darksiders II isnt anywhere near as bad as I first thought it was.For one thing, even if the pan flute-heavy score in the first area is a little grating, its not nearly as bad as I remember it being. (Its quite possible that it was such a jarring difference from the first Darksiders, its gained an outsized role in my memory.) Whats more, its only one part of a much longer game, which I would have learned if I hadnt been so hasty in dismissing it the first time.Beyond that, Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition works for the same reasons the original Darksiders worked: because  as my colleague Dustin Chadwell noted seven years ago  it blends together the best parts of God of War with the best parts of The Legend of Zelda. The combat is mostly pretty smooth, the environmental puzzles are pleasantly challenging, and you always feel like theres plenty of world to explore.If theres a downside to Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition, its that its performance still isnt consistent. Its not as bad as it was on PS4 or Xbox One, but there are still quite a few obvious hiccups. Its not uncommon for the game to freeze for a moment while it loads the next section. Similarly, there are parts where the quality of the visuals drops noticeably. Its mostly okay, but if you go in expecting a flawless experience, youll be disappointed.If, however, you go in hoping for a game thats merely fun, then Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition will more than fit the bill. Its a good reminder of why people were so pleased when the series was reborn last year, and its a solid action game to have in your Switch library.", "date": "October 22, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
