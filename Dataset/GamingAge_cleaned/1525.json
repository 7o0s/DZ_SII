{"name": "Joe Danger 2: The Movie", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/01/joe-danger-2-movie-review-ps-vita/", "text": "I feel like I should like Joe Danger 2: The Movie a lot more than I do. After all, theres nothing particularly bad about it. In fact, it has more than its fair share of positives, all stemming from the fact it doesnt feel like Hello Games had to make any sacrifices to move their game from home consoles to the Vita. The controls are pretty easy to figure out, and theyre every bit as responsive as they should be. It looks fantastic, even on the smaller screen. Its got a fun, simple narrative (a stuntman is making a movie!) that doesnt require any knowledge whatsoever of the series first game. Taken on its own, its about as unobjectionable as you can get.The more I think about it, though, I think thats the key phrase: taking the game on its own. Because, obviously, thats an impossible thing to do; Joe Danger 2 doesnt exist in a vacuum, it exists in a world where there was a Joe Danger 1 (minus the 1. of course). And whats more, theres not a huge world of difference between the two games. There may be slight improvements here and there  multiplayer was added, along with a bit more of a story  but for the most part, what you did there is what youre doing here. Thats not necessarily a problem, mind you, since the first game was a lot of fun and its great to play more of itbut it makes it difficult to get really, really excited for it.Not only that, theres a world beyond Joe Danger to consider, too. There are plenty of games that occupy a not-entirely-dissimilar space: the Trials series, Urban Trial Freestyle, Motorbike, and all kinds of physics-based mobile racers. Expand the whole stunt/trick racing out a little more, and you could probably include games like OlliOlli, too. While they may not all be worth playing, I think its safe to say that Joe Danger 2 no longer has its niche entirely to itself anymore.", "date": "January 30, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
