{"name": "Resident Evil 6", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/06/resident-evil-6-review-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "Desperate times call for lazy decisions. No wait, thats wrong. Actually, in the case of Resident Evil 6 for PS4 and Xbox One, its a valid statement. Released not even four years ago, Capcom felt, despite its mixed reception, the game sold well enough to become their2nd best selling title as of Sept 2015, and in turn, justified a remaster. Thats a lot to take in. For me, RE6 is the weakest link in the dying franchise and thats being nice. In the hopes of Capcom putting a better effort in 2016 to celebrate the series 20th Anniversary, I was eager to see if they fixed or improved some of the flaws with the game. You know what they say, paint rust whatever color you want, its still rust.I can report this release is essentially the same release from 2012 with the addition of the multiplayer maps and costume DLC that I could care less about. The only saving grace this time around is that all the campaign chapters including Adas is unlocked from the start. This means you can play through Leons campaign (easily the highlight of the game) and skip over Chris. Trust me, you arent missing anything good. I wont be digging deep into the game since its identical other than visuals to its last gen counterpart. Here is our original review.Keep in mind this is the first of a trilogy of RE-masters this year with Resident Evil 5 and 4 next on the list. Lets hope that at least Resident Evil 4 isnt the same HD release that has been pumped out time and time again. I think its safe to say thats wishful thinking. So who is this game for? Gluttons for punishment? Die Hard Fans of the series? Dare I say, me? Clearly, something has me still playing through the game despite completing it when it was first released. Im not sure I will ever have the answer for you. Maybe its the hope that the 2nd time around, I could find love for it.It may simply be that I have been a hardcore fan of the series since even before the launch of the original. I had a preorder at Electronics Boutique back in the day, months before the release and have played just about every release to date. This includes the original Resident Evil Survivor which dare I say, is more enjoyable thanResident Evil 6. At the end of the day, if you didnt play RE6 when it first released, I dont see why you would jump in now, other than the fact that it looks better.", "date": "June 3, 2016", "grade": "D"}
