{"name": "Monopoly Family Fun Pack", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/12/monopoly-family-fun-pack-review-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "In theory, Monopoly should be a pretty hard game to screw up. I mean, I know there are people out there who hate the board game, but its still been around for about eighty years. By now, Id think that what works and what doesnt has been all figured out, more or less.Judging from the Monopoly Family Fun Pack, however, it seems Im sorely mistaken. You can, in fact, make Monopoly almost unplayable by taking only a few simple steps.The first one is simple, really: just add in a quick die option that makes roll of the dice  something that shouldnt be any more difficult that moving forward anywhere between two and twelve spaces  an exercise in total randomness. Roll a six, send a player all the way around the board! Five actually means eight, except when it means twelve or eighteen! Left is right, up is down, dont explain what anything means, and sit back and watch as a beloved old board game suddenly becomes impossible to understand.Thats not all you can do to ruin Monopoly, of course. You can make it possible to change some house rules, like players getting extra cash for landing on Go or Free Parkingbut you only let them change one rule at a time, because why would anyone ever want to change more than that in a single game? Also, you can make it so that the quick option doesnt really make the game any quicker, because if youre going to play Monopoly, then youre only doing so because you have at least an hour to kill, right?One of the key things you have to do in ruining Monopoly, though, has to do with the games fairness. Specifically: dont make the game fair, because obviously people hate that. It doesnt matter if people are playing the traditiona way or the quick/incomprehensible way, its obvious that everyone much prefers games where the AI players are unbeatable, even on the very easiest difficulty levels. Oh, and dont listen to anyone who complains that the AI will always get lucky rolls and have every break seem to go the computers way. Thats just loser talk.If youve done all this stuff, then youve obviously poisoned the well as far as old-school monopoly goes, but what if people bypass the traditional board game and opt for Monopoly Deal instead? What then?Thats obviously harder to screw up, but the makers of the Monopoly Family Fun Pack certainly try their hardest. First off, they dont actually include the game on-disc, but rather hide it behind the Hasbro Game Channel, which you need to download and install before you can then download and install Monopoly Deal, too. Just in case thats too simple, though, they also include a Buy button, so that even though its free, you still have to hover over it for a moment, debating whether you want to find out if theyll charge you again for a game thats listed on the box. (They dont, but its not exactly encouraging.) Get over that, and youll discover that theyve made the game online multiplayer only, because who ever heard of a card game having AI? And to top it all off, online seems to be pretty dead, which means that the game only really exists if youre lucky.", "date": "December 19, 2014", "grade": "C-"}
