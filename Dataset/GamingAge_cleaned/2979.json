I mean, just look at the name: how could a game with that title be anything but a joke?It also doesnt help that the world looks like something that was slapped together in an hour or two. The titular dogs are actually stock photos of dogs, the sounds they make when you pet them are very clearly humans making dog noises, pretty much every object in the game is a geometric shape, and the only time you see another human, theyre more like a blocky humanoid than a real person. If you just go by what youre seeing, itd be very easy to think this is a case of a game where they came up with the title first and then decided to make a game to go with it.The more you play, though, the more you get the feeling that theres a little more to it. The point of the game is that youre traveling to all these places to meet up with your partner. I dont want to give anything away, but the real story in An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs is about long-distance relationships, not an airport run by dogs. Whats more, the story is told via some pretty solid writing. The way your character and his partner, Krista, interact is full of the kind of weird in-jokes and references that make up the language of any long-term couple. The dialogue between the two doesnt always make a tonne of sense, but at the same time it feels a lot more realistic than a lot of the dialogue youll find in most other games. For such a silly-seeming game, its awfully deep  emotionally impactful, even.Of course, between all those interactions, An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs very much lives up to its title. Youre running around airports scattered all over the galaxy, doing fetch quests (pun possibly not intended?) for dogs named things like Photo Dog (it takes your photo), and Pill Dog (who wants pills) and Boarding Pass Dog (who takes your boarding pass when its time to board your plane) and Suitcase Dog (who sells suitcases). Its here that the game falls apart a little. While the dog pictures are undeniably cute, and the interactions with each dog contain some pretty funny writing, it doesnt take long before youre seeing the same dogs and same quests over and over and over. Its fun at first, but by the third or fourth airport it starts getting a little tedious. Couple that with a somewhat inflated price tag of $20, and its pretty clear why I wouldnt say you need to rush out and get this game immediately. Still, even with those flaws, An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs is far better than it has any right to be. Its a lot deeper and more touching than its title suggests, so its worth keeping an eye on it, waiting for a sale, and then grabbing the when the price is right.", "date": "January 23, 2023", "grade": "B"}
