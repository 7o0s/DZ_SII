{"name": "Cruel Bands Career", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/03/cruel-bands-career-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Ive played a lot of niche games, but Cruel Bands Career might just be the niche-iest.First off, theres its visual aesthetic. I meanjust look at it. Im not sure how to describe it as anything other than hideous  though obviously, art is subjective, and Im sure there are plenty of people whose stomachs arent turned by the games harsh visual identity. And even if I dislike it immensely, I have no problem calling it unique  it looks like some terrifying mashup of Cuphead crossed with a grotesque Japanese cartoon.And for anyone who isnt turned off by Cruel Bands Careers art style, theres the gameplay, which is so brutal it makes the games visuals look positively tame.This may sound overly harsh, but its nothing compared to how harsh the game is. In Cruel Bands Career, the whole point is to get beaten up. Youre in control of a trio, and the entire game consists of seemingly endless waves of fans walking in a straight line at your band, and just pummeling them. Your strategy isnt built around defending, but rather seeing how you can balance the punishment evenly enough so that none of your musicians dies and the show ends.Cruel Bands Career is so harsh that even the power-ups  mainly female groupies in tight, ill-fitting clothing, suggesting the games ugliness goes way deeper than its gameplay and visuals  dont really do you much good. You can rotate your band around so that the groupies give one of your musicians a health boost, but the other two will take health hits because of jealousy. (And again, its not lost on me that it feels like theres a healthy dose of misogyny on top of everything else thats messed up here.) Even there, the point is to minimize damage, rather than actually getting ahead.But, I mean, what else would you expect from a game that has cruel right in its name? Cruel Bands Career is a harsh game is all kinds of ways, and you should only check it out if youre in the mood for a bit of masochism.", "date": "March 22, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
