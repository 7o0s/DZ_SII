{"name": "Demon Gaze II", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/02/demon-gaze-ii-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Its been years since I last played or even thought about  Demon Gaze, but judging from what I wrote a few years ago, Im struck by how much of what I wrote then could also apply to Demon Gaze II. Its not amazing, but its also not terrible: it exists in the vast middle ground between those two extremes, somewhere right around the middle.That said, Id say that Demon Gaze II is a teensy bit closely to the good end of the spectrum than its predecessor. For starters, the fanservice isnt quite as bad here. Even if I dont remember the first Demon Gaze that well, I do remember that it featured some scantily-clad prepubescent girls for no reason almost right off the bat. By contrast, while few of the female characters here are dressed in a way that could be described as practical, their outfits arent as cringeworthy as last time, either.The story is also a little better this time. Demon Gaze II may also feature an amnesiac hero, but this game does a better job of advancing the story without obsessing over that fact. Its not the most riveting story Ive ever heard, but its at least serviceable.In fact, the more I think about Demon Gaze II, the more I realize that, in nearly every respect, it feels like this game is a redone version of the first game, only with incremental improvements. The combat flows a little more smoothly. The graphics are a tiny bit nicer. The dungeons through which youre crawling feature more interesting enemies, and seem to be a little bigger. Name an area where the first game was a little lacking, and you can rest assured that Demon Gaze II improves on it in some way.Which, really, is what you should ask for a sequel. Demon Gaze wasnt the kind of game that was so bad that it needed to be reinvented from the ground up, it was so average enough that a sequel could make slight improvements and still feel like progress. Luckily, Demon Gaze II does that: like the first game, its solid enough that you can play it without being too disappointed, but with the added bonus that things are a little bit better this time around.", "date": "February 12, 2018", "grade": "B"}
