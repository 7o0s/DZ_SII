{"name": "Megadimension Neptunia VIIR", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/07/megadimension-neptunia-viir-review-for-ps4/", "text": "One of Megadimension Neptunia VIIRs big selling points is that its added VR features to 2016s Megadimension Neptunia VII. Full disclosure: I dont have PSVR, which means I have no idea whether their inclusion here makes a substantial difference. I mean, given that were talking about a JRPG, I have a hard time imagining that VR would transform the game in any major way, but in the interest of fairness, I feel thats probably worth noting.That said, the games other selling point is that its an enhanced version of Megadimension Neptunia VII, featuring a new engine and a new battle system. As someone who played  and was mostly indifferent towards  Megadimension Neptunia VII, the promise of such changes was enough to at least pique my interest.Turns out that my usual rule of thumb when it comes to Neptunia games still holds true: theyre only worth playing when they stray from the standard JRPG formula. In the case of Megadimension Neptunia VIIR, which is based on one of the series mainline entries, this means that what you see is what you get. (However, it also theoretically means that the VR portions might be worthwhile  though, again, I cant comment on that front).By which I mean: much of what I said last time out about Megadimension Neptunia VII still applies. Sure, it looks a little nicer thanks to the updated engine, but these games arent exactly graphics powerhouses. Likewise, the battle system may be slightly updated, but were still talking about parties engaging in turn-based battles  its not like theyve reinvented the wheel.On the bright side, I guess, if you didnt play Megadimension Neptunia VII, then Megadimension Neptunia VIIR offers you a perfect chance to jump in and get a slightly improved experience than you would have otherwise. But that just raises the question: who would be interested in a Neptunia game that didnt play Megadimension Neptunia VII, but suddenly needs to play now? I cant imagine theres a huge audience for this out there, but for those elusive few holdouts, now is as good a time as any to jump in.", "date": "July 13, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
