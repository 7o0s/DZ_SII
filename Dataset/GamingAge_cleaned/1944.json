The ones that are adored by critics and beloved by fans, yet, for whatever reason, you just cant get into? Spelunky is one of those games for me.Dont get me wrong, I see why people like it. Its an insanely difficult platformer that randomly generates each new level. Its got a graphic style that hits a sweet spot between retro and adorably cute. The controls are as precise as youd hope theyd be for a game where pretty much everything can kill you. On an intellectual level, I get it.But when it comes down to actually playing itwell, lets just say that my appreciation for the game remains in the abstract.Admittedly, a big part of why Im having trouble getting into Spelunky is that Im absolutely awful at it. I mean, I have no problem with platformers being hard (see: Cloudberry Kingdom and Stealth Inc. for two recent examples), but this game is on a whole other level of sadistic difficulty. Whereas those games at least let you play levels as many times as you wanted  thereby giving you a chance to learn from your mistakes and figure out where to improve  Spelunky treats each new game as a one-shot deal. Once you die, thats it, and youre sent back to the beginning to try againexcept this time, its basically a whole new game with different levels.", "date": "September 3, 2013", "grade": "B"}
