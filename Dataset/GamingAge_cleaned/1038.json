{"name": "Laser Disco Defenders", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/08/laser-disco-defenders-review-ps-vita/", "text": "I have a complicated relationship with hard games. On the one hand, I play nearly everything on the easiest difficulty setting available, since I dont generally like being enraged by what Im playing. On the other hand, every so often Ill get hooked on a super-hard game and Ill keep playing no matter how many times I die. I cant quite put a finger on why my brain puts Dark Souls-type games on one side of that line and the likes of Hotline Miami on the other, but I know that the line exists.Its also a line that Laser Disco Defenders keeps bouncing back and forth across. On the one hand, its ridiculously difficult. Its a twin-stick shooter whose twist (that your fired lasers never disappear, they just keep bouncing around the small, confined space in which youre flying) seems to run contrary to the point of the genre. Even if youre surrounded by enemies, you may be able to take them out with a well-placed shot, but that doesnt actually lessen the peril in which you find yourself  it just means you have a different, arguably more unpredictable danger to worry about.As you can imagine, for someone  say, like me  who tends to approach twin-stick shooters with a guns blazing attitude, it makes for a challenging experience. The more you shoot, the harder Laser Disco Defenders gets. This was a truth that hit home for me again and again and again, as I never came anywhere close to the end of the game. To some degree, this was because, on top of the challenging gameplay, there were some goals that seemed simply unrealistic. In general, though, my failings were because this is a really, really hard game.And yet, I kept going back to it again and again. Id start up a new game, die somewhere around the fifth procedurally-generated world or so, and begin again in a new World 1 almost immediately. I did so even though I showed virtually no improvement after playing for hours and hours. Why? Because it was fun, thats why.It helps, too, that the controls are as simple and tight as any twin-stick shooter; left stick moves your character, right stick aims your shot, and you fire your laser with the right shoulder button. Its as straightforward as it gets, and its intuitive enough that you never feel the game is asking you to do anything impossible. The whole aesthetic also does a great job of keeping things light and breezy; between the psychedelic colours and the pulsating disco soundtrack, its easy to get in a groove, even if that groove is carried out over several different games.", "date": "August 30, 2016", "grade": "A-"}
