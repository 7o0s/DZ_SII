It wasnt much to look at, and there werent a tonne of gameplay options, but I really liked it nonetheless.This summer, Im playing Super Soccer Blast. Its not much to look at. And there arent a tonne of gameplay options, but I really like it nonetheless.Im noticing a trend here.The reason Super Soccer Blast works so well is awfully similar to the reason Super Tennis Blast worked so well: it doesnt try to do too much, but what it does do (soccer in this case, obviously) it does very well. This is actually much more impressive in Super Soccer Blasts case. There arent a lot of really good tennis games out there, so simply being competent makes you stand out. When it comes to soccer games, by contrast, youve got the annualized FIFA titles that do a pretty exceptional job of recreating the sport in video game form.Now, Super Soccer Blast obviously isnt a FIFA competitor, and if you go in expecting bells and whistles, you wont find them. But if you just want a simple, straightforward soccer match where you get to pick a team and guide them through an international championship tournament of some kind, you get that here.You also get a game thats awfully easy to pick up and play. The controls dont go too far beyond shoot, pass, and tackle, but thats what makes it so fun. Moreover, the difficulty level is just right  the opposition is never easy to beat no matter what skill level youre playing on, but you never feel like youre up against AI teams that are literally impossible to beat, either.All this means, of course, that Super Soccer Blast isnt a particularly deep game. Notwithstanding the existence of a player/team editor, you cant really control that much. You dont get to swap in new players (either during or between games) and you cant change your tactics or formation. What you see what you start up the game is what you get.", "date": "August 12, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
