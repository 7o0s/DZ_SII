My mom got me hooked on Scrabble at a very young age, and to this day I cant see collections of letters without automatically trying to figure out how many words I can make out of them  even if were only talking about a few letters on a license plate. Its almost an addiction, and it means any time I come across a word-centric video game, Im instantly intrigued.In the case of Letter Quest: Grimms Journey Remastered, I dont just mention this addiction because I want you to be aware that I may approach it with a slightly different mindset than most people. I mention it because, deep down, it makes me think this game may not be very good.See, every time I play it, I find that it doesnt take long before my attention starts to wander. As neat as the concept of an RPG built entirely around word creation sounds, in practice it gets pretty repetitive pretty quickly: spell words, kill monsters, repeat. And repeat. And repeat.To developer Bacon Bandits credit, they did try and inject a little variety into the proceedings. For example, each level has four stars, and to earn each star you have to do something different. Its a great idea, but its ruined by the fact that it really just means you have to play the same level three times to earn three stars, and then the fourth star is basically impossible to earn unless youve completely maxed out every facet of your character.Likewise, there are some special letter effects  things like plague letters that spread if you dont eliminate them fast enough, and spiked letters that hurt you if you use them  but unless youre extraordinarily bad at this game, their impact will be somewhere between non-existent and negligible. The same could be said for all the different upgrades: youll want to build up your health bar as much as possible, but anything beyond that they all seem kind of useless.In all of this, of course, I should emphasize that Letter Quests core gameplay isnt all that bad. If youre like me, youll get excessive amounts of joy out of playing a round or two and seeing all the crazy words you can come up with. Its easy enough to figure out, and the controls are a breeze.", "date": "May 2, 2016", "grade": "B-"}
