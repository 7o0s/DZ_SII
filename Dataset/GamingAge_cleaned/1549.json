{"name": "Starwhal", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/12/starwhal-review-for-pc/", "text": "Weve got a lot of indie games bubbling up in all corners of the net these days. Its great, its experimental, and at times nakedly naive. Projects from up-and-comers are chomping at the same bit that would-bes with immature ideas are vying for  both drawing different eyes to their games. Starwhal falls somewhere into a grey area of this spectrum, between careful decision-making and a polished up game jam spec people will probably pay for.Its also an ostentatious time, with joke games attracting people happy to shell out a few bucks for a giggle. This is more the target that Starwhal seems to be seeking out, with a subtitle of Just the Tip that hopes its clever enough for someone who gets a dick joke and repeat it to their friends. Its catchy, at least. And, its publicity for an otherwise unassuming game based on the silliness of wiggly mechanics behind sea life jousting at each other.At its heart, Starwhal is actually kind of cute. Its gameplay based on the clumsy nature of piloting a narwhal, in order to land a strike on an opponents body by squirming and fumbling about each other. In its greatest dreams, Starwhal would be a tightly-controlled game about pirouetting smartly from the edge of a wall into the heart of your opponent, but reality shows a game that entertains based on the sloppiness of its execution. For what is there, the hodgepodge of faux-80s, space, and forced wackiness are at least honest about the game having no sense of direction.In a lot of ways, Starwhal reminds me of Sonic the Hedgehogs lurch into 3D. Certainly, at a time, Sonics mechanics were a great idea  perfectly tailored to the 2D platform genre he was born into. We were impressed with the blast processing power which whipped us through the thoughtfully-designed levels which complimented that gameplay. Once a third dimension was added, the accessible nature of 2D platforming was revealed to be all SEGA had a grip on, with no clear means of how to adapt.Starwhal is similarly dead in the water when taken out of its original idea that players would struggle to outwit and outperform an opponent in an arena. Breaking targets, obstacle courses, even a score timer add nothing past the versus mode. The only purpose these modes ultimately serve is to reveal how light Starwhal is on ideas once its left the gate. Not only are they demonstrations of how the mechanics are only suited for playing against others, but ones which feel tossed in to give any sense of value past the 15 or so minutes that Versus mode takes to give a full picture of the game.", "date": "December 22, 2014", "grade": "D+"}
