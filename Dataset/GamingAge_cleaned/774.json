{"name": "Patapon: Remastered", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/08/patapon-remastered-review-ps4/", "text": "The past two years weve seen a return of the rhythm genre, whether we were asking for it or not. So, Sony decided to not only remaster their original rhythm entry; PaRappa the Rapper (to mixed results), but now were seeing the remastered release of the PSP classic; Patapon (pound that drum). Originally released in 2008 for the PSP, Patapon became a pretty big hit for Sonys handheld and even spawned two sequels. Funny that in 2017 Sony has decided to begin to remaster some PSP titles, first LocoRoco and now Patapon; two very niche market games, but I applaud them for doing it. As I mentioned in my review for LocoRoco, I hope they comb the PSP library a bit more and remaster some more titles that havent seen any release beyond the handheld, but Im sure that will rely heavily on the sale of these remasters.Just like LocoRoco, I owned Patapon back in the heyday of the PSP (and still own it), so I was eager to see if it held up as well as LocoRoco did. I should preface this review by saying that I enjoyed Patapon back during its original release, but I wasnt as crazy about it as some of its fanboys were and possibly still are (Greg Miller). Patapon looks great on the PS4, similar in cartoon style to LocoRoco, remastering it worked well. What didnt hold up, however, is any of the rendered cut scenes, as they didnt change them at all and they look pretty awful.I should also speak on the biggest controversy with this release; input lag. Some reviews are reporting they experienced input lag to a degree that made the game unplayable. Fortunately, I didnt encounter any major lag in my time with Patapon. It did take me some time to get back in the groove with the beat, and there were some points that I felt were off, but nothing major enough to say it destroyed my experience. Im not sure if this is an issue due to combination of hardware type, TV and/or surround sound, but regardless I can say my gameplay didnt feel influenced by any major lag.", "date": "August 4, 2017", "grade": "C+"}
