I have, just a few weeks ago? Wellnow that Ive played Mixups by POWGI, I guess its time for me to say it again.Of course, it shouldnt come as any surprise that Im enjoying Mixups so much. After all, it was included in last years Word Puzzles by POWGI on the Switch, which I also loved. Just about my only complaint is that, this time out, its the only puzzle on offer, rather than as part of a group of five other word games.Actually, thats not true. If Im being totally honest, Mixups was maybe my fourth-favourite game out of those six  at best  and playing it again here, Im reminded of how frustrating it can sometimes be. Youre given a batch of letters, and out of that batch you have to find three words connected by a common thread. While occasionally the solution is easy, sometimes the solutions seem a little obscure  like, maybe Im just betraying my botanical ignorance, but when Im trying to find Sweet Things, William doesnt seem like an even remotely obvious. Its also not uncommon for puzzles to include letters that form other, equally valid words, and it can be frustrating to figure out exactly what the developers are going for as you guess.But whatever momentary feelings of frustration I had while playing Mixups were more than outnumbered by how much fun I had overall. Even without the other five games Word Puzzles had, its still a worthwhile purchase if youre the sort who plays word games  and I am, which means (like most of Lightwood Games other offerings) I cant get enough of it.", "date": "March 7, 2019", "grade": "B"}
