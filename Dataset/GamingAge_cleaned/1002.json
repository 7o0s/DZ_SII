{"name": "FIFA 17", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/10/fifa-17-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Even though Im a fairly avid sports gamer, I have to admit that Ive basically ignored the FIFA franchise for the last few years. As I said just a few weeks ago about NBA 2K17, my opinion of sports games hinges entirely on the quality of the career mode. Seeing as Ive long found FIFA to be pretty lacking in that regard, its just dropped off my radar entirely.Someone at EA apparently felt the same way, because FIFA 17 borrows a page from the NBA 2K handbook with the introduction of a narrative-style career mode called The Journey. And you know what? It works pretty well. In fact, in some ways it works better than what you find in the NBA 2K series, because the main character here faces more adversity. Whereas in the NBA series you play as a burgeoning star, here you play as Alex Hunter, a teenager whos fighting to make a name for himself after being cut from his soccer academy, and then being sent away from his EPL team to play at a lower level. Its pretty compelling stuff, even for someone like me who only follows the sport every four years at World Cup time.It helps, of course, that the voice acting is strong  though its entirely possible that Im just doing that North American thing where we automatically equate British accents with stronger acting. It helps even more that the graphics are pretty impressive. The characters here are defined not just by what they say, but by whats left unsaid; the game helps itself a lot in this respect, with surprisingly expressive faces (and, of course, with top-of-the-line in-game animations, too). To top it all off, the game has branching dialogue trees, which allows you to give your player the kind of personality you want, rather than what the game dictates you should have. Add it all up, and you have a single-player experience thats almost unparalleled for a sports game.In every other respect, FIFA 17 is more or less what youd expect. Theres the Ultimate Team, and its accompanying emphasis on trying to get you to spend money on its various goodies. Theres the online component, that features both multiplayer matches and online clubs. And, of course, theres the omnipresent hilarious glitches. None of it reinvents the wheel, of course, but its all that most people want out of their FIFA.", "date": "October 5, 2016", "grade": "A"}
