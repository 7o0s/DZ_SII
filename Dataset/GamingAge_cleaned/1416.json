Then youll probably like Sketchcross. Did the word nonograms send you to Wikipedia to find out what, exactly, they are? Then this probably isnt the game for you.Ill freely admit I had no idea what they were until I started playing this game. I have to say, though, that now that Ive had them in my lifewell, Im pretty sure I wasnt missing out on all that much.A big part of the problem, of course, may just be how theyre presented in Sketchcross. Generally, the picture logic puzzles here come in two varieties: really easy or impossibly difficult, with virtually no middle ground to speak of. Youll be cruising along, enjoying puzzles that arent too taxing, when all of a sudden youll get hit with one thats exponentially harder than anything thats come before it. Its pretty jarring, to go from a puzzle that you can solve in under a minute to one that lists the average time as ten minutes, but thats an experience that youll come across regularly if you decide to play Sketchcross.Thats not the games only issue, though. Its also got a surprisingly unintuitive interface. I say surprising because it looks like Sketchcross should be easy enough to figure out. The nonograms can be filled in with a touch of your finger, making it well-suited to the Vita. The problem iswell, everything else. Accidentally skip past the opening invitation to play the tutorial, for example, and youll be scratching your head at how to find that option again. Likewise, zoom in on one part of the puzzle  which youll need to do, since the moment the puzzles get harder youll have to zoom in if you want to avoid accidentally rubbing every square in sight  and you may find it oddly difficult to zoom back out.", "date": "June 8, 2015", "grade": "B-"}
