It offers a wide variety of tournaments to play in, from Europe-only, to Americas-only, to, as the title implies, Americas vs Europe. But functionally, its practically identical to last years Super Soccer Blast.Admittedly, Super Soccer Blast itself was a pretty solid game, so its not like Im going to complain about having another reason to play it (or a game very, very, very, similar to it). Super Soccer Blast: America VS Europe picks up exactly where its predecessor left off, with lots of tournament options to choose from, a decent team editor tool, and very easy pick-up-and-play arcade soccer controls.But seriously, its the exact same game, just with more teams to choose from. Im not going to say not to buy Super Soccer Blast: America VS Europe if youre a fan of arcade soccer, but if you played Super Soccer Blast last year (or even if you played Super Sports Blast, which also includes that game), then theres really no reason to pick this up too.", "date": "September 30, 2021", "grade": "B"}
