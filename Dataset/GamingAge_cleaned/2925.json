{"name": "Project Warlock", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/07/project-warlock-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "I have a couple of very vague memories of playing Doom back in the mid-90s at a friends house. (It may well have been Wolfenstein, for all I know.) I was terrible at it. Needless to say, it didnt leave a lasting impression, nor did it engender in me a sense of nostalgia for that whole genre of early first-person shooters.As such, theres not a lot about Project Warlock that speaks to me, since the whole game is built around hoping that not only do people desperately want to play Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, Duke Nukem, et al, once again, theyll play this instead of playing any of those classics, most of which are still easily available even today (and generally at much cheaper prices).Its not that Project Warlock is badly made or anything, because its not. Between the 3D pixel art graphics and the over-the-top gore (not to mention the insane difficulty level), this game very faithfully evokes all its 25+-year-old influences. You could put it alongside any of its forebears, and you might not be able to tell the difference. I mean, you probably would, since Project Warlock looks like a modern game trying to look retro, but youd at least have to spend a moment or two thinking about it.But thats kind of the problem with the game, too. Its so wholly indebted to the past, it never tries to do anything new. Sure, it looks a little cleaner, and I suspect the controls are a little smoother, but theres nothing here that suggests its aware of any developments in gaming post-1995. Theres barely even a story holding it all together  its just all nostalgia, all the time.", "date": "July 22, 2020", "grade": "C"}
