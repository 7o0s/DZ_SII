{"name": "The House in Fata Morgana", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/08/the-house-in-fata-morgana-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-pc/", "text": "After several years of playing all kinds of different visual novels  an unintended byproduct of being a Vita enthusiast  Ive come to expect that the genre tends to produce some pretty dark, bleak stuff. Whether were talking Steins;Gate, Danganronpa, Muv-Luv, whatever  the common thread running through all of them is that theyve got ridiculously high body counts, and that everyone involved usually undergoes significant emotional and physical pain and trauma.Still, even by those standards, The House in Fata Morgana seems particularly bleak. How bleak? Let me out it this way: there are a bunch of different intersecting stories here, and the least disturbing one is the one that involves incest, extreme jealousy, and revenge. No one is explicitly murdered, however, so by the standards of this game, its light, fluffy fare. After all, from there, the story bounces around between centuries, and at various times it includes murder, insanity, more murder, rape, mental and physical torture, slavery, brothels, even more murder, intersex babies, mutilation, and still more murder. I probably missed a few killings in there  and to be fair, the ending is kinda-sorta-almost uplifting, as these things go  but you get the gist: this is a dark, bloody game.With so much tragedy, youd expect some dark, gothic graphicsand youd be right. However, even if its about as clichd as youd expect, that doesnt make it any less nice to look at. There are some really striking visuals here, from an inhuman beast ripping into someone (with blood splattering across the screen), to characters the camera zooming in on individual characters during scenes of heightened drama, to simple nature scenes. For the most part, of course, the game is mainly just characters sliding on and off the screen, as is standard for the genre, but even then, they still look interesting, like works of art come to (sort-of) life.On top of that, the writing and characterization here are relatively solid. Given that translation so often seems like an afterthought in localized visual novels, its impressive to see a game where there was actually care and attention put into what youre reading.", "date": "August 11, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
