{"name": "The Mooseman", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/12/the-mooseman-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "If nothing else, The Mooseman cements for me the idea that Sometimes You is one of the most interesting publishers out there. There are many (many, many) publishers who put out better games, but between NORTH, Its Spring Again, One Eyed Kutkh, and now The Mooseman (along with a bunch of games Im probably forgetting), they clearly have a thing for the artsy and the incomprehensible.In The Moosemans case, this means turning the mythology of an ancient Russian tribe (the pagan Finno-Ugric Perm-Chuds, if you want to be precise) into a adventure-platformer hybrid. You know, the usual video game fare.Snark aside, it actually works much better than you might expect. The game involves you playing as the titular character, moving across a harsh environment filled with all kinds of obstacles. The twist? The world exists on multiple planes of reality, which means that where, say, you see a rock on one level, on another youll see some kind of monster. Traversing any given environment means figuring out which level of reality you want to be on.As you can tell, its not a complex game. Nor is it a long one, seeing as you can easily beat it in under two hours. However, it makes up for its brevity and its lack of complexity by providing insights into a culture that almost certainly has never been featured in a game before, via collectible relics and accompanying explanatory notes.In other words, your enjoyment of The Mooseman will come down to how much you enjoy edutainment. Its definitely not for everyone, and if you dont feel like reading every new page, then what youre left with is a short, uneventful adventure game. If, however, that doesnt phase you, then there might just be enough here to make The Mooseman worth your while.", "date": "December 18, 2018", "grade": "B"}
