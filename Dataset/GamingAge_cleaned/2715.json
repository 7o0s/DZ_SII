A few years ago I reviewed the imaginatively-titled Thief Simulator; it was mediocre, if were being generous. Now here we are with Picklock, and its barely any better. Is it really that hard to make a game where you break into places and steal stuff?Strangely enough, the worst thing about Thief Simulator is also the worst thing about Picklock  which is to say, the controls in Picklock are terrible. Its a stealth game where being stealthy is pretty much impossible by virtue of the fact youve got a kinda top-down/kinda-isometric camera that never gives you a good angle of where youre going or what youre doing. You cant ever get a good look at the locks youre trying to pick, the cops youre trying to avoid, or the goods youre trying to steal, and as a result youre mostly just hoping for the best when it comes to all three.In fact, thats probably an understatement. The reality is that you constantly feel like youre fighting against Picklocks awful, impossible camera. It feels like no matter what angle you move it to, youll always be fiddling around to be in just the right position to  for example  both allow you to open a door and walk through it. This isnt an issue in the tutorial, but the moment you get into a level where you need to avoid being seen and time is of the essence, it quickly becomes apparent that the game isnt giving you the tools you need to succeed.Also, the AI is simply bizarre. One time I walked right in front of a security guard and wasnt even noticedwhile another time, I was simply walking outside, minding my own business before Id had a chance to do anything illegal, when a guard burst out of the soon-to-be-but-not-yet scene of the crime and beat my thief to a pulp for no apparent reason.Its too bad that the gameplay is so poor, because in the right hands Picklock could have been fun  albeit for a very short amount of time, given there are only about a dozen levels here. Its got a decent sense of humour, as evidenced by the visual gags youll find here and there. Its also got a fun voxel-art style, and an enjoyably jazzy soundtrack. Games are a lot more than their aesthetics, obviously, but fun graphics and music can go a long way towards making them worthwhile.Not in Picklocks case though. It doesnt matter if it looks and sounds this good when it also plays this poorly.", "date": "March 11, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
