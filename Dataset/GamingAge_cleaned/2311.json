In that respect, if you dont like games that are less forgiving with their simulation, youre only going to get frustrated with Sniper Elite. This is especially true of its hardest difficulty setting that uses more realistic bullet ballistics  its like being force fed a large slice of humble pie. The silver-lining is it unabashedly lets you know what youre getting away with in games like CoD or Battlefield; not that its ridiculously hard taking into account wind and gravity (with the assists), just that youll need to readjust from what youre used to And snap sniping is far less likely.Prior to play, I assumed the V2 meant version two, as its a sequel, but its actually a tie-in with the games storyline. Bit of a history lesson here (but its an interesting one): Towards the end of WW2, the allied nations were racing against Russia to get as many Nazi scientists and engineers to defect to their respective countries. Of particularly high interest were German rocket scientists because they were they were head and shoulders above the rest of the world in the development of jet propulsion for aircraft and missiles. The biggest success in the world of rocket science at the end of the war was the German V-2 rocket Yes, V2, like the games name!In Sniper Elite V2, youre tasked with sniping German and/or Russian officials to prevent V2 rocket scientists from defecting to Russia instead of the US. Things go to hell, so you end up having to do more than just assassination runs, but the set up is pretty rad. Even though liberties have been taken with historical accuracy for SEV2, this kind of thing did happen in less specular degrees (to be fair, the only rocket scientist I know of is Wernher von Braun.) How much the game deviates from the actual history is beside the point as its still a neat perspective on the WW2 genre, particularly when compared to what were used to.I guess SEV2s biggest claim to fame is the x-ray bullet cam, aka ultra violent torn guts and bone shattering death cam. When you successfully fire a fatal shot at a target, the camera follows your bullets flight path until it penetrates the victim, then it goes x-ray so you can see the bodily carnage. Of course the entire display is in slow motion to emphasize the splattery mess your bullet is creating. Its kind of gimmicky; just following the bullet as it enters someones head does a good job of emphasizing your death dealing, but Im not convinced that showing their brains getting blown out of their ass actually adds to the game in any tangible way.Conversely, unlike the gratuitous x-ray cam, the various ways of performing stealth kills add to the game and gameplay. Not just sneaking up and melee killing an enemy or using a silenced weapon while youre crouched unseen behind a stove, but cracking off shots timed with lightning or bell chimes so they go unnoticed is where the money is at. In my opinion, Rebellion should have focused even more on those mechanics rather than worry about making someones face being blown in half look even more gruesome. Hell, they should have spent that time refining the games close-quarters controls just to round out the game a little better.Because of the games somewhat restrictive set En boksholder, der har  blackjack skema , har vundet. up, levels dont vary too greatly. Missions, regardless of their objective, typically play out in the same fashion: sneak into position, snipe/detonate your target(s), sneak (or run) your casino internet way out of the hot spot. I can understand why someone would tire of this formula, but on the harder difficulties the repetition serves as a good way to get a solid grasp on the mechanics and, at times, awkward, controls Kind of like Assassins Creed, but less fluid and not close-quarters centric. Its definitely not a game for the impatient; you crouch/crawl a lot in order to avoid detection and its slow going sneaking around.Actually, with all the third-person sneaking involved, the game reminded me of both Assassins Creed and Metal Gear Solid quite a bit, which I wasnt expecting. The sneaking is complete with wall-hugging and a meter indicating when/if enemies see you. Plus theres a silenced single-action pistol that you invariably rely on to prevent the entire third reich from potato mashing your ass before or after an assassination/detonation. The tension and suspense of trying to remain hidden or prevent alarm is the kind of stuff that never gets old though (although it does cause your blood pressure to rise considerably), so it offers a certain unique satisfaction.Im a fan of co-op and Sniper Elite V2 doesnt disappoint; you can play through the campaign, fight off increasing waves of Nazis (ala horde), or snipe while your partner works his way up a battlefields checkpoints. All of them are decent, but none of them are so good as to replace to replace heavy hitters like CoD or BF. In fact, the only modes the game lacks are more traditional multiplayer, opting instead to focus on doing things as a team in co-op. Realistically the multiplayer of SEV2 is supplemental to the one-man experience, but they do increase replayability.Being that visibility and distance play an integral part of the experience, a higher resolution and more vivid display could only make the visuals and gameplay better. I have to assume then, that youll have an easier time playing on PC; not only would the increased resolution help, but the more precise controls of the mouse would probably pay off when you got used to it. The game has all the mechanics of a PC game, but all the superficial polish of a Console game and it tries to balance the two to make it appealing for both. Its not that it does a bad job, but it does make me wonder how far 505/Rebellion couldve/wouldve taken the game had they gone one way or the other (PC or console.)", "date": "June 1, 2012", "grade": "C"}
