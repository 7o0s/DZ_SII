{"name": "Lost Phone Stories", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/10/lost-phone-stories-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "If intentions and ideas were everything, Lost Phone Stories would have a lot going for it.After all, from a gameplay perspective, it offers something you dont see all that often: a text adventure that tells its story via clues you have to find while searching through a lost phone. Theres no denying that thats a pretty inventive approach, taking the found art approach of storytelling taken by some walking simulators and pushing it even further.Moreover, the two games included here  A Normal Lost Phone and Another Lost Phone: Lauras Story  touch on some pretty heady themes that you dont usually see video games try and handle. I dont want to spoil anything just yet, but its always welcome when games are willing to embrace their role as an artistic medium to try and explore themes that dont usually get explored.Unfortunately, as praiseworthy as some elements of Lost Phone Stories may be, the whole package still leaves a lot to be desired.For one thing, even if the themes are worth exploring, the way theyre presented here still feels more than a little creepy and voyeuristic. To some extent thats kind of the point of these two games, but, as Kotaku wrote about in a spoiler-heavy piece on A Normal Lost Phone, that doesnt make it any less exploitative or problematic. As much as you want to see video games demonstrate that theyre equipped to cover mature issues like sexual identity and domestic violence, they need to be able to do so with nuance and care  which, obviously, isnt really possible when the whole point of the game is read text messages and emails, find secrets, use secrets to progress.For another thing, to work Lost Phone Stories needs really compelling stories  after all, both games rely on being so interesting and engaging that you cant help but want to search through the phones to figure out what to do next. And, quite frankly, they dont succeed. On the one hand, I fully recognize that the fact Im a straight male may make it harder for me to appreciate the stories being told here, and that the simple act of representation can matter a lot if youre coming from an underrepresented group. At the same time, though, theres no reason why a trans teens story or a battered womans story should be any less interesting than what youd usually get in a video game. In fact, if anything, youd think sheer novelty would make them even more interesting. That theyre not  and Ill point again to that Kotaku article for a good breakdown of why A Normal Lost Phone doesnt work on a storytelling level  suggests that the stories here just arent that good.Which is a shame, because you always want to see games try new things  which Lost Phone Stories undeniably does. Unfortunately, it also undeniably isnt that good at making those new things engaging, and for that reason, it ends up being less Check this game out!, and more Its intentions are admirable.", "date": "October 5, 2018", "grade": "C-"}
