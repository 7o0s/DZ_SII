{"name": "Normans Great Illusion", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/05/normans-great-illusion-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-series-x-pc/", "text": "On the Steam page for Normans Great Illusion, the games developers wrote the following:If You:  do not distinguish between class struggle and spiritual struggle;  believe that imperialism is a confrontation of ancient empires; and  think that nothing could be better than capitalism; please DO NOT BUY our game.As you can probably tell from that, this is a game that has Something To Say  and yes, the capitalized letters are important, because this game clearly takes itself very seriously. Between the revolutionary quotes that start every day in the game and the one good ending being the one where you and your family go on the run with a Marxist study group and eventually help start a new just society, theres a not-at-all-subtle ideological streak running through this game.Heres the thing, though: its all a pile of gibbering, useless garbage.(The game, that is. Not necessarily the ideology underlying it  though if Im being honest, thats only slightly more coherent than this drek.)The biggest issue with Normans Great Illusion is that even though its presented as delivering all these great, grand truths, its an incoherent mess. Its very clearly influenced by games like Papers, Please and Beholder 2, which try to show you the inherent absurdity of living under an authoritarian/totalitarian dictatorship. In those games, you have to make your living in a world full of paranoia and rules that change day to day. Even as the contradictions started to pile up and you had to navigate systems in which failure was the inevitable outcome, those games found a way to make clerical banality seem thrilling.Lets just say that Normans Great Illusion doesnt do that. Between what I mentioned above and the fact that the interstitial quotes between your home life and your work life are things like First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a socialist and There is no war but class war it seems pretty clear that the game is trying to critique capitalism. Exceptit doesnt. Like, at all. In this game, you get up in the morning, have a mundane conversation with your wife where she repeats the propaganda that shes heard on the radio, drive to work, do math, and go home. Then you repeat those actions until you trigger one of the games seven endings.As critiques of capitalism go, its pretty baffling. Maybe someone told the developers that in Marxist utopias, you dont have to drive to work every day or do repetitive jobs (especially ones that involve math)? Or that theres no propaganda of any kind? If Normans Great Illusion were a critique of an authoritarian dystopia, it would make sense, but because its so committed to a very specific ideology, its too blinded to see that its not coming anywhere close to making the point it seems to think its making.In any case, even setting aside the ideology, it doesnt make for particularly interesting or compelling gameplay. The dialogue is wooden and stilted, and the driving and math minigames are simplistic and dull. And seeing as thats literally everything there is to do in Normans Great Illusion, that means theres no reason to pick it up.", "date": "May 24, 2021", "grade": "D-"}
