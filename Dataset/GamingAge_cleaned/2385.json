{"name": "Final Fantasy XIII-2 Lightning DLC", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/02/final-fantasy-xiii-2-lightning-dlc-review-for-psn-xbla/", "text": "The first batch of DLC for Square-Enixs Final Fantasy XIII-2 hit just a couple weeks ago, and I recently sat down to spend some time with the new content. This small add-on, which costs $2.99 through PSN or 240 points on Xbox 360, gives you a new battle in the Coliseum to take on both Lightning and Lt. Amodar, a small side character from the original XIII.As far as content goes, its pretty light, but at the asking price I feel like its not a bad little addition. Of course were all clamoring for the upcoming story DLC, especially after that tease of an ending, and unfortunately theres no story content here. Theres not even any real reason as to why youre battling Lightning or Amodar, which does feel a little odd.Upon purchasing the DLC, a new hub will unlock on your timeline overworld map, shown as a separate location from the other Coliseum that you encounter in the main story. When you enter the Coliseum you can approach the Arbiter of Time and hell offer up your battle options, which certainly seems to show that there will be more likeminded DLC coming in the future.The actual fight is fairly tough, but by the time I played through this I had already maxed out my characters as far as they could go in every class available, so it just took a small amount of time to figure out the best combination of roles to use. Id say that this content is appropriately challenging for late game players, but it does seem like you could definitely take the duo on before the game ends.Lightnings role is a Ravager, while Amador takes on the Commando role. The real reason for fighting these two comes from the possibility of them dropping their monster crystal, which will allow you to add them into their party. Both characters are pretty useful as end game party members, and Lightning is certainly comparable to high end Ravagers like the Blue Chocobo. She comes equipped with all the elemental strike skills, which I cant think of another Ravager that does.The only real complaint I have to level against the content is that the drop rate for their monster crystals is abysmal. It took about 15 battles for me to get Lightnings Crystal, and thats with the appropriate fragment skills and equipment to maximize drops. Even making liberal use of feral links didnt seem to help. And it took twice as long (if not more after I stopped counting) to get Amadors crystal.", "date": "February 24, 2012", "grade": "B-"}
