{"name": "Out of the Park Baseball 15", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/04/park-baseball-15-review-pc/", "text": "In a roundabout way, Out of the Park Baseball 15 has me really excited for Football Manager Classic on the PS Vita to make its way over to North America.Admittedly, its not hard to get me excited for anything on the PS Vita. But in this case, its particularly apt. Both OOTP and FMC, after all, are PC-based sports management sims, with the key difference  apart from one being about baseball and the other centered around soccer, obviously  being that the latter recently launched a handheld edition which features full cross-save capabilities, allowing PC gamers to bring their games with them on the go.OOTP Baseball, of course, doesnt have this option (unless the developers are vastly underselling what OOTP 14 can do). But the more I play it  and the more addicted to it I get  the more I really, really wish I couldve taken my game with me wherever I go. I get that there are all kinds of technological and financial reasons why OOTP 15 is PC-only, but still: if ever a game was made for bringing with you wherever you want, itd be this one.Complaining about what OOTP 15 cant do, however, is a little churlish, particularly in light of how much its capable of. First and foremost, it allows you to dig down deep into everything a baseball franchise does  signing free agents (both the regular and international kind), drafting and developing young talent, setting your line-ups and pitching rotation, setting ticket prices, swinging trades, and so on. Basically, if the first thing you do when you get the newest version of The Show is start remaking your roster, then you know exactly whats in store for you.Dont make the mistake of thinking this is just The Show without fancy graphics, though. No, OOTP 15 promises you can build your own baseball world, and it allows you to do just that. Want the Expos to stay in Montreal? You can do that. Want to take control of the National League from its birth in 1876 and guide it through to the present day? You can do that too. Ever wondered how the 2000 Colorado Rockies would fare in a neutralized run scoring environment? Thats an option too, though I have to say that thats a lot less fun than playing around with the Baseball References Neutralizer tool and seeing some of the crazy numbers it churns out. (Seriously: just go look at Barry Bonds lifetime numbers set to 2000 Colorado. Id say theyre video game numbers, but Ive never seen numbers like that in a game. But I digress.)If North American baseball isnt your thing, you can try your hand in one of seven other leagues around the world  because really, who doesnt want to play Dutch Honkbal? And if reality in general isnt your thing, you can also create fictional leagues with up to 50 teams.", "date": "April 25, 2014", "grade": "A-"}
