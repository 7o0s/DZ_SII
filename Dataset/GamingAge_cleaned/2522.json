{"name": "Nexomon", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/10/nexomon-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps5-4-xbox-series-x-one/", "text": "I have two main thoughts about Nexomon:These two points arent as diametrically opposed as they may seem at first glance. See, Nexomon is basically a very well-made Pokmon clone. On any system except for the Switch, thats not really a strike against it, since theres no legal way to get Pokmon on, say, your PS5. On the Switch, by contrast, theres quite a few options if you want to hunt down some pocket monsters  which makes Nexomon largely redundant.Still, for what it is (and, I guess, for what it costs, since its a fraction of the price of most Pokmon games), Nexomon is pretty enjoyable, and I say that as someone whos never been able to get into Pokmon all that much. Obviously, given how thoroughly it straight up steals everything from Pokmon, it should come as no surprise that the game works pretty smoothly  but given how many failed clones Ive seen before, the developers deserve credit, at the very least, for making such an expert imitation.I mean that sincerely, too. If youre just after a game where you wander from village to village, fighting and capturing monsters as you build up your team to take on progressively stronger bosses, Nexomon gives you exactly that. Whats more, it looks fairly nice and polished, and theres enough threads of a story that you wont mind sinking a dozen or so hours into it.Again, theres literally nothing original going on here, and if youre going to play Nexomon on the Switch, you should probably only do so after youve thoroughly exhausted your Pokmon options. But if youre playing it on another system  or even if you just want to return to the days of a top-down Pokmon  then you could do a lot worse than checking out Nexomon.", "date": "October 15, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
