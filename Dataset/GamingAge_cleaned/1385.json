See, its an adventure game I was able to beat with a minimum of outside help, and thats normally not something Im able to achieve on my own. The very fact I was able to do that makes me feel a certain fondness towards it  even if I can see that, as adventure games go, its got its fair share of flaws.First and foremost among these: the game features some ridiculous spikes in difficulty. And I dont just mean that every so often it becomes a little harder than normal. I mean that Whispering Willows is generally a fairly easy, straightforward game that occasionally becomes thoroughly impossible. I dont want to give away exactly what happens  the whole thing centres around a mysterious ghost story, after all  but there are one or two spots (particularly near the end) where the game suddenly throws aside everything else its trying to do in the name of killing your character at all costs. At these points, youre basically relying 100% on luck to get by. Youll eventually get through with a bit of persistence, of course, but its still pretty jarring to go from one end of the difficulty spectrum to the other with no warning whatsoever.The only other area in the game thats even slightly as difficult is in the way it expects you to just remember everything. Now, for the most part, thats not too difficult; youre generally tasked with going to Person or Point A, where youre instructed to go to Person/Point B, where in turn you get sent on your way to Person/Point C, and so on. That, obviously, doesnt require too much memorization, and as long as you can follow along with the story it will mostly make sense. But considering there are a couple of pretty sizeable places to explore  the main mansion, obviously, to say nothing of when you start off the game stuck in some catacombs  Whispering Willows definitely wouldve benefited from providing players with some kind of map. After all, it forces you to read through dozens and dozens of note to reveal its story; one more screen doesnt seem like it wouldve complicated things too much.Thankfully, even without a map, youll probably be able to follow along simply because the plot is pretty engaging. Its a spooky little ghost story about a girl trying to rescue her father from a haunted mansion, and Whispering Willows does a good job of conveying everything you need to know via notes scattered throughout the mansion grounds. Its not a particularly long story, but it doesnt need to be, either; I suspect that if it had taken longer than the few hours it takes to beat the game, it wouldve required some unnecessary plot padding, and that wouldnt have helped the game in any way.What does help the game, by contrast: its incredibly foreboding atmosphere. Whispering Willows understands that the best way to make something scary is simply by creating a vague sense of unease, and it nails that vibe consistently. Between the spooky shadows at the edge of the screen, the creepy sounds that emanate from every darkened corner and bush, and  most importantly  the sinister soundtrack thats constantly, persistently moving forward, this game knows what it takes to leave you feeling seriously unsettled.", "date": "July 23, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
