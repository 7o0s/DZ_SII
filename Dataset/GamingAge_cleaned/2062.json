And I dont just mean that in a broad, This game borrows heavily from every 8 and 16 bit RPG of the last 25 years sense, either. Im talking literally: Dragon Fantasy Book 1 is a port of the iOS game of the same name.Of course, its the borrows heavily from the past 25 years aspect that will define the game for most people. After all, I dont think its a stretch to say that if you played games like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest or The Adventure of Link  or if you even play a lot of those games more modern descendants  then theres a lot here thatll seem familiar, from the top-down gameplay and turn-based combat (complete with the fight/magic/item/run options), to the retro graphics and chiptunes music. It should almost go without saying (but Ill say it anyways) that your enjoyment of those games will largely dictate how much you enjoy Dragon Fantasy Book 1.Its not the only factor, though. Personally, I never liked any of those games, I didnt have the patience for them first time around, and nostalgia goggles havent made me appreciate them any more  but I found Dragon Fantasy to be a relatively fun experience.A lot of this comes down to writing. No matter how rote Dragon Fantasy may seem with its quests and its monsters and whatnot, it doesnt take long for the game to reveal that its got a surprisingly funny soul. I mean, the hero, Ogden, is chubby and balding. Your first weapon is a pokin stick. The first two monsters you take on are Mr. Rock Monster, who complains about his marital troubles, followed by Mrs. Rock Monster, who is worried she looks fat. Subsequent monsters are named things like Lt. Slicey and Lt. Dicey, Obligatory Ork and Mister Lizard. In a genre prone to seriousness, Dragon Fantasys willingness to poke fun at cliches is most welcome.(And Ill be honest: even if I proclaimed myself immune to nostalgia goggles just a few paragraphs ago, Id be lying if I didnt admit to being a little charmed by the way you could switch the games graphics between 8 and 16 bits, to say nothing of the literally note-perfect chip-tune soundtrack.)", "date": "April 23, 2013", "grade": "B"}
