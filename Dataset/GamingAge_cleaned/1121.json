{"name": "Ray Gigant", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/05/ray-gigant-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Maybe Im reading too much into it, but I feel like Ray Gigant presents an interesting thought experiment: what if Japanese monster movies had developed following the 2011 Japanese earthquakes, rather than in the wake of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?Obviously there are some problems with the idea, not least of which is the fact that this game, with all its giant monsters, owes some degree of debt to the legacy of Godzilla and all his gigantic pals. Still, with all the early talk the game gives to characters talking about where they were when the first waves of destruction hit, its not hard to draw the same kind of connections between the earthquake and Ray Gigant that people were able to draw between the atomic bombs and nuclear panic movies that originated in the 50s.Unfortunately, while Ray Gigant may be interesting as a thought experiment, Im not so sure its as interesting as a game. This is primarily due to the fact that, like far too many Japanese games, it thinks that obnoxious teenage whining is the most fascinating thing in the world.Obviously, the fact that so many Japanese developers continue to make high school teens the focus of their games suggests theres a thriving market for that particular setting. But that doesnt make it any more interesting or enjoyable, as far as Im concerned  not least because the alternative, in this particular case, wouldve been a game about giant freaking monsters. But no, Acttil and Bandai Namco decided that itd be more interesting to watch a bunch of generic tropes  sorry, generic teens obsess over sex, food, and all the other usual themes that these games touch on.This might be easy to overlook if the gameplay itself was a little more interesting, but for the most part, it relies on pretty well-worn clichs there, too. You and your party are traversing a giant dungeon, killing monsters in turn-based battles and trying to ramp up your stats as quickly as possible so that you dont get insta-killed by the boss (sorry, the gigant) waiting for you at the end of the level. Admittedly, once you reach said boss, the game does some interesting things, like a rhythm-based minigame that ups the strength of your attacks and a multi-level showdown that requires thinking about how you want to distribute your attacks amongst your team members, but a couple of minutes of innovation dont make up for how generic the rest of the battle system is.Oh, and word to the wise: you may hear talk of how Ray Gigant represents a streamlined approach to the DRPG, and that its far easier than Acttils usual games. Dont believe this  or, at the very least, dont expect that to mean its a particularly easy game. No matter how simplified Ray Gigant may seem to veterans of the scene, its still pretty difficult unless you want to put in the time and build up all your characters.", "date": "May 11, 2016", "grade": "C+"}
