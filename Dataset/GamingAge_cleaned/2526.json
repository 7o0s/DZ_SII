Sign me up!  when I initially started playing it, my hopes werent all that high. I mean, the game started life as a Skyrim mod. With no disrespect to modders, I wasnt expecting the game to feel like much more than an Elder Scrolls sidestory.I was so wrong.Mind you, its hard to go too much into details as to what makes The Forgotten City so exceptional. Like any good mystery novel, its got a tightly knit, well-crafted plot, and part of the joy of the game is discovering everything for yourself. Theres a lot going on in The Forgotten Citys small world and the twenty or so characters who inhabit it, and its to the games credit that as soon as you unravel one mystery, itll point you in the direction of another, until next thing you know you cant stop playing until youve discovered the giant, overarching secret that connects it all.Again, I dont want to give away too much, but its really neat how The Forgotten City places clues everywhere, and uncovering each new piece of the story requires you to go back and re-evaluate everything youve seen to that point. While this easily couldve led to a very repetitive game, The Forgotten City also knows how to add in shortcuts  both literally and figuratively  to make everything move a little faster, rather than forcing you to read the same dialogue and perform the same actions over and over again.Further, quite aside from the story, its fascinating how The Forgotten City is able to cram so much history (and maybe even educational elements?) into its small-ish frame. At every turn, the game subtly throws in little historical nuggets, making it almost feel like youre learning something. To be honest, my knowledge of ancient Rome isnt all that detailed (to say nothing of some of the other surprises you uncover while playing through the game), so maybe its all bunk, but to my unlearned eyes, it all came off as pretty fascinating.If I were to nitpick, Id admit there are a couple of minor issues with the game. There were lots of moments where the game either slowed to a crawl or froze, usually when it was saving, but other times for no reason at all. Similarly, there were enough glitches  things like people walking through solid objects, or getting stuck in impossible spots  that, at a certain point, they basically became a given.But none of them were enough to distract me from how much I loved The Forgotten City. Its a fun game built around a tantalizing mystery, and once it gets its hooks into you, youre guaranteed to want to keeping playing until youve uncovered all its endings.", "date": "October 12, 2021", "grade": "A"}
