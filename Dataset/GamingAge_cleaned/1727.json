{"name": "Borderlands 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/05/borderlands-2-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Considering the near-universal acclaim that greeted Borderlands 2 on its initial release, the question facing the game on its release on the Vita isnt is it any good? That, after all, has been greeted with a pretty definitive yes. Rather, the question it has to answer is, can such a huge, bold expansive game be shrunk down to fit on the PS Vita?While some people may disagree, I think that the answer there can be answered in the affirmative just as emphatically. Because however you want to look at it, Borderlands 2 on the Vita is a pretty impressive accomplishment. It looks great, it plays great, its justgreat.Graphically speaking, the game is helped by the fact the console versions aimed for distinctive rather than state of the art. The cel-shaded look that worked so wonderful on consoles is just as gorgeous here, with Pandoras wastelands and ruined villages coming to life on the Vitas screen. Admittedly, its not a perfect port  as witnessed by the opening cutscene  but on the whole, it looks great enough that those few weak moments are easy to overlook.Happily, when it comes to the controls, there arent even those minor compromises: Borderlands 2 works here so well that you might believe the game was designed for the Vita. Seriously. It works so well, it even manages to make using the rear touch pad seem worthwhile. There arent many other games that can say that, so Iron Galaxy deserves all kinds of plaudits for pulling that off. (And, of course, if tapping the back of your Vita isnt your style, you can always map it to something else.)I know Im supposed to harp on some minor shortcomings here, but honestly, I cant think of any. If youre really a stickler for multiplayer, I guess its a little annoying that the game only allows for 2 players in a game, rather than up to 4. Personally, I cant say Im too annoyed by the change, since I only ever play the game in single-player mode, but Im sure there are people to whom this matters a great deal.", "date": "May 14, 2014", "grade": "A"}
