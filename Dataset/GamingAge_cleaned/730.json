I first caught wind of the game from my nephew actually, who devoted a pretty impressive amount of time to the game, and has given me multiple tales of his exploits with his tribe throughout their time playing the game. So I decided with the official release of the game, along with the PS4 release, Id finally give it a shot.To say that I was ill-prepared for Ark: Survival Evolved would be putting it mildly. I had played survival games before, and was no stranger to the basic mechanics. Gather resources, build clothing and supplies, and try to improve your character as you gain more abilities and crafting recipes throughout. But Ark is such a massive game that I was easily overwhelmed during my first couple of hours, and found myself constantly needing to restart as I tried to both stay alive and learn the basic mechanics of the game.This isnt necessarily a bad thing, and maybe not that much of a surprise going in. But there was certainly a large learning curve in my experience with Ark: Survival Evolved that I still dont think I fully have a handle on. However, the promise of taming dinosaurs, both big and small, and gaining access to more modern equipment and weaponry, helped keep my interest up. And while Id say Im still a very, very far way from experiencing everything that Ark: Survival Evolved has to offer, I do think I have a decent grasp on the mechanics and ideas, enough so that I at least have found my footing with the game a month or so into release.", "date": "September 20, 2017", "grade": null}
