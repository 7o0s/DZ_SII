It would probably look somewhat similar to Hourglass.Of course, you could probably substitute a whole bunch of games for Portal in that last paragraph. Rime, The Witness, QUBE, Talos Principle, The Spectrum Retreat, Faraday Protocoolthe list of first-person puzzlers goes on and on, and Hourglass is indebted to pretty much all of them. Its not what youd call an original game.To be fair, of course, it never tries to hide its influences. When it first showed up on Kickstarter a few years ago, it stated right up front that it was influenced by Portal, The Witness, and Rime, and it very clearly lives up to that promise.Further, even if its more like a pastiche of other, largely better games, that doesnt mean that Hourglass is a bad game itself. Once you get beyond playing spot the influence, in fact, youll find that it offers a pretty decent experience. While few of its puzzles are challenging  nearly all of them involve creating a ghost of yourself to step on a button, and then using that as an opening to grab a rather Portal-y looking box, which you then place on another button to open a door  theyre at least guided by an obvious and discernible logic. Whats more, the game doesnt extend itself further than it needs to: youll be able to finish it in a few hours, and it never feels padded.Again, theres not really anything new or inventive here. If youve played any first-person puzzlers in the past decade-plus, youll know exactly what to expect in Hourglass. But if you liked any of them, the good news is that youll at least find things to enjoy here, too. Hourglass may not be original, but its still a decent enough way to spend a few hours.", "date": "August 30, 2022", "grade": "B"}
