{"name": "Super Smash Bros.", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/10/super-smash-bros-review-3ds/", "text": "Super Smash Bros. returns with the release of the 4th installment of the fighting game series, hitting a Nintendo handheld for the first time. While theres still a console version of the game waiting in the wings for release in November, you can still get your full Smash fix via the 3DS. Just like previous installments, this game feels like a love letter to all of Nintendos eclectic franchises, featuring a wide-array of characters in the playable roster, and tons of secondary references via the trophy system, along with a plethora of stages to check out with up to three other players online and off.Super Smash Bros. is packed with a number of modes, including offline and online competitive multiplayer. While the MP is certainly the main draw of the series, I can appreciate a lot of the additional content being offered here. Modes like Smash Run, which take on a side-scrolling action game style of gameplay, offering a neat alternative to your standard 1 vs. 1, Team, and Smash multiplayer modes. Theres a decent training mode to hone your skills in, a challenge board that unlocks additional items, lots of customizable abilities and costumes, and whole lot more.But again, its the multiplayer thatll keep you coming back for more. Super Smash Bros. features both online and offline play, for up to four users. If playing locally, everyone will need a copy of the game, but local play certainly offers the best experience here. You can compete in Team battles of 2 vs. 2, or square off in 1 vs. 1 battles as well. The traditional Smash experience, a 4-player free-for-all, is featured too. You can also put into play a number of options, with multiple items available to include or exclude, and alternate stage types for just about every stage present. Theres really a lot packed in here, and youre sure to have a blast playing the game offline.Online is a bit different. While the online version of Smash Bros. does feature some options, including ranked and unranked play, along with different modes, my experience with it wasnt that great. And thats primarily down to lag, which was a constant issue for me regardless of characters, stages, or modes selected. Obviously some of that is going to be due to my internet connection, but working through wi-fi on a number of other consoles with multiplayer modes, I rarely encounter lag as frequent and annoying as I seem to with Smash Bros. Its really disappointing, as my options to play locally with three other players is quite limited. I was honestly expecting a bit more out of the game in this regard, and ultimately felt a bit let down by the online stability of Super Smash Bros. I certainly hope that the Wii U version of the game fares a bit better in this regard, but at least local play will be more viable on Wii U for me.I also struggled a little bit with the controls, primarily due to the slide pad. Its really not a great replacement for an analog or c-stick on certain movements, and its easy to see how some players were able to outright damage the pad while playing Smash Bros. Im not that aggressive with my handheld, but if youre somebody that really hammers away at a controller, youll likely have some trouble here. I found myself adjusting over time, but Im fairly positive the controls will also be superior in the console version of the game.", "date": "October 8, 2014", "grade": "B"}
