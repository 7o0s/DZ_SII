{"name": "MLB The Show 17", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/03/mlb-show-17-review-ps4/", "text": "Its been a long time since the MLB The Show franchise had any real console competition. The MLB2K series tried to match it as a true-to-life baseball sim, but it failed miserably and died an unremarked death a few years ago. After that, Major League Baseball themselves tried filling the void with arcade-style baseball by resurrecting the R.B.I. Baseball franchise, but its been handled so ineptly that every years release reaches new depths of awfulness. Apart from that, just about the only thing out there is Super Mega Baseball  which, dont get me wrong, was pretty fun (and the upcoming sequel looks promising), but theres still a pretty sizeable gap between that game and a series that, by itself, is reason enough to buy PS4.Which makes the inclusion of a Retro mode in MLB The Show 17 kind of hilarious when you think about it. See, the game as a whole is, as youd expect, everything a hardcore baseball fan could ever want, much like each of its predecessors. Its got all the usual bells and whistles that have typified the series thus far, along with a few tweaks here and there that make the game even more addictive that Ill get to in a moment.Retro mode, however, seems to exist solely to show just how badly the reborn R.B.I. Baseball franchise series has fumbled the ball since its return.Okay, probably not solely. Im sure that Sony and San Diego Studios wanted to include a game mode that could be enjoyed by everyone, and it just so happened that they made one that wipes the floor with R.B.I. Baseball in every conceivable way. But still, its fun to imagine that the mode got its start out of spite.Whatever its genesis, theres no denying that whereas R.B.I. Baseball 16 was  like R.B.I. Baseball 15 and R.B.I. Baseball 14 before it  thoroughly terrible and an abject failure at providing a fun experience for casual players, MLB The Show 17s retro mode shows how easy it should be to make a baseball game that even total newcomers can enjoy. Hitting is a breeze, pitching is simple, you can do almost all its core functions with just a few button presses, the ball moves in a way that obeys basic physicsreally, it has all the core elements that helped 80s kids fall hard for the original NES R.B.I. Baseball, and it does so with such a minimum of fuss that you cant help but wonder how MLB Advanced Media consistently manage to screw up making a simple arcade baseball game every year without fail.Aside from Retro mode, MLB The Show 17s other big new feature is an RPG-style take on Road to the Show. Whereas before you simply created your player, played the games, and improved their skills, this time out RTTS seems to have looked to FIFA and NBA2K for inspiration. However, rather than taking the approach of those two series and focusing its attention on a pre-made athlete with a pre-written plot, MLB The Show 17 narrates your created players actions and gives voice to his thoughts. Itsodd, and a little hokey at times. But it also manages the impressive feat of adding a new wrinkle to a feature that was getting a little stale without fundamentally altering what makes the feature so essential in the first place, so its a change Im willing to live with.A change Im a little less crazy about is the fact Harold Reynolds is now one of the announcers. While Im certainly open to anything that reduces Matt Vasgersians role in the game  as someone whos put literally hundreds and hundreds of hours into MLB The Show over the years, there are only so many times I can hear him shout Santa Maria!  this is definitely a case of subtraction by addition, since not only does the game still recycle most of Vasgersians lines from the last decade, it now also features Reynolds spouting the same terrible analysis that hes become known for on Fox and MLB Network, too.Having said all this, theres still one great unknown aspect of MLB The Show 17: its online. At the risk of getting too inside baseball (pun not intended), I should admit I didnt get a chance to test that out because of review restrictions. The review version of the game only allowed for online play if you had a wired connection  something that just wasnt possible in my case. Seeing as online generally worked pretty well in last years edition of MLB The Show, its probably not an issue here, but I just want to make it clear that my verdict on the game is based entirely on its single-player modes.", "date": "March 28, 2017", "grade": "A"}
