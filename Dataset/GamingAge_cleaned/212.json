{"name": "Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/11/birushana-rising-flower-of-genpei-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "If I were to come up with a list of settings for romance novels  even romantic visual novels  I dont think small 12th century Japanese civil wars would be anywhere near the top. After playing Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, however, Im thinking this is more reflective of a failure of imagination on my part than a lack of romance in that particular time and place.Admittedly, Birushana is an otome visual novel, which arent generally known for allowing reality to intrude on their carefully-crafted fantasies. Whats more, while my knowledge of the Heiji Rebellion goes no further than whats included in its Wikipedia entry, I have a strong suspicion that the warring factions in Japan-circa-1160 werent exclusively comprised of super-attractive men with flowing hair who liked to stand around showing off their pecs. Still, given this is a genre that has also imagined a world where Sherlock Holmes and Jack the Ripper vied for the same womans affections, simply placing Birushana in a real world filled with people who actually lived during the era in question counts as true life romance. Whats more, it also means that the game has a wealth of material to work from  its not just trying figure out the right path for main character Shanao, its also helping her navigate through the complicated political environment on the eve of an even larger civil war. This means that while youve got to carefully weigh your answers in terms of Shanaos love choices, youre also occasionally asked to decide whether to try to defuse tense situations, or rush headlong into battle. Mind you, this also highlights Birushanas one drawback: it features a lot of action, and you dont get to control any of it. I know, I know: its a visual novel, and thats par for the course. Still, given all the swordplay, its hard not to feel like youre missing out on the fun as steel clashes all over the screen.But if youre playing Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei for the action, youre missing the point. This is a otome romance novel through and through  and whats more, its a good enough otome that even if the setting doesnt sound all that romantic, it still achieves its goal.", "date": "November 18, 2022", "grade": "B"}
