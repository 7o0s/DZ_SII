{"name": "Death Stranding: Directors Cut", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/10/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-for-ps5/", "text": "When Death Stranding originally launched in 2019, the world was given a game that love it or hate it, is entirely unique. There is no other game out there that you can compare Death Stranding to. It is an experience from beginning to end that can in many ways prove that video games can be just as good at storytelling as the best movies. The Directors Cut promises to deliver you Death Stranding as it was originally intended, in its full, definitive form. So what differences can you expect to see within the Directors Cut?The first and most obvious thing you will see is just how much better all of the visuals are. The PS5 is able to handle the game at a smooth and crisp 60 FPS and deliver beautiful visuals in the textures and world details. Browse the settings menu and you will find a cinematic mode offered to you, which puts the game in a 21:9 format, condensing your hud into the new viewing area, and making the game somehow feel even more atmospheric and dazzling. Cutscenes have seemingly all been re-rendered to look their best and to match the quality increase of the rest of the game, so youre given a smooth and uniform experience all around.Within the realm of the open world, Death Strandings Directors Cut remains much the same as the original release. Many of the changes you will experience and notice as you roam in the early game areas are additions made possible by the PS5s Dualsense controller. As you pick up more cargo and carry it, youll find your triggers are increasingly hard to pull in, making keeping your balance feel much more involved should you choose to overburden your character. You get the feeling of ripples across your hands should you use your scanner, the bouncing of Sams footsteps under your fingers as youre pulling the triggers, the unique trigger pull and recoil of each weapon. Its an additional level of immersion supplied within this release of the game that totally changed the experience.Youre introduced pretty early on to the new firing range thats available to you at any shelter you visit. This gives you both a much-appreciated chance to practice with weapons before taking them onto the field as well as a handful of challenges and score competitions against friends and the general internet. Also added in this vein is the race track- an opportunity to use (or abuse) the highways you spent so many precious materials assembling. Also allowing you to compete on a leaderboard, these races seem to introduce some slick new vehicles to Sams lineup. Accompanying this is a more expansive highway system, so not only do you get to race on the highway- theres a substantial amount more of it to cover.Venture further into the story and more and more wild creations appear in your PCC. Before you know it, youll be catapulting cargo across the world with a cannon, taking your bike off the new booster ramps to shoot yourself over mountains and climb to areas never possible before the Directors cut release thanks to the new Chiral bridges. A handful of new weapons also help to pad out your arsenal, so you can handle the world the way you want. The Maser gun you get very early on lets you quietly zap enemies from far away, knocking them unconscious without alerting others. When all else fails and you resort to your fists, youll also find several changes here. What used to be a standard rotation of punch, punch, kick has been fleshed out to feel less repetitive. Youll notice a knee thrown here and there, or maybe you end up giving an enemy the full Sam delivery via a running dropkick.Several changes have been made to improve upon previously existing tech as well. Youre now able to take your floaters (the cargo carriers that can follow you) across zip lines. This fact changes a ton about how you can and will navigate the world. In the original version of the game, I found that I basically would never use the zip lines, because despite how helpful they were for navigation, you had to abandon your cargo carriers. The trade-off, in my opinion, was rarely worth it, but I constantly found myself walking much more than I probably needed to, just because I wanted to be a hoarder and collect every container I saw. The delivery bots have surprisingly been given more as well, allowing you to hop on for a ride while they run their destination. Set the delivery bot up to run an errand for you, jump aboard and go have a break while the game takes you for a ride.Honestly, so much has been tweaked, added, or expanded upon in Death Stranding: Directors Cut, that I could probably go on for pages and pages about it. I laid out what I think are some of the biggest and best changes above, but theres so much more to it that I couldnt possibly tell you all of. If you loved Death Stranding when it launched, the amount of new content and experiences added in the Directors Cut is well worth the $10 they ask of you for the upgrade. Having played through the base game myself on both PS4 and PC, and now again in the Directors Cut, it was well worth the new playthrough. If you have never played Death Stranding and are on the fence about picking it up, this is the version to go for. Everything about it has been improved upon, and navigation has been perfected, so if you dont want to walk 20 minutes to every destination, the Directors Cut has supplied you with all the right tools to make it faster and more efficient.
