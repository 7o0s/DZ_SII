Its as if someone, somewhere, wished for another Portal, and the response was, Sure, butThe reality, thankfully, isnt quite as bad as you might expect.I mean, to be clear, its no substitute for Portal 3. It has some Portal-related elements, like GLaDOS snarky menace, the original games colour scheme, sentry drones, and, er, portals. But on the whole, this is more a reskinned version of Bridge Constructor than anything remotely like another entry in the Portal series.Not that theres anything wrong with that, in and of itself. The original Bridge Constructor was a fine game. Not an all-time classic or anything, but still an enjoyable way to pass the time.The same goes for Bridge Constructor Portal. If you go in expecting (or hoping, or wanting) another Portal, youll be sorely disappointed. But if you go in expecting more Bridge Constructor, it totally does the job. You still have to figure out how to get a convoy from Point A to Point B, and you still have a variety of construction materials at your disposal to help you pull that off. The addition of portals adds a nice twist, throwing in a much heavier emphasis on physics and momentum than the previous game had.But for the most part, Bridge Constructor Portal is Bridge Constructor II in all but name. As I said, its a poor substitute for another actual Portal game, but if you just want a casual building game that you can drop in and out of, with the added bonus of a nice sense of humour, this will more than do the job.", "date": "July 23, 2018", "grade": "B"}
