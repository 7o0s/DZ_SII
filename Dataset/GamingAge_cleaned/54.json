I started it on my Vita about an hour and a half ago. After an hour, I got the Platinum Trophy, and kept on going all the way to level 55 or so, at which time the game constantly starting slowed down to the point it became completely unplayable. Slightly discouraged, I started playing the game on my PS4, and this time the Platinum took me less than half an hour (with, thankfully, no apparent slowdown).So, to review: less than 90 minutes, two Platinums. Yep, this is another Ratalaika Game.I wouldnt say that my brief time with Mekabolt is unpleasant. Forgettable, sure, seeing as were talking about a retro-looking platformer where the main character doesnt even seem to have a name, but its not bad by any stretch. Its hook  that you have a gun that allows you to turn on and off the various robots that inhabit the world, and you can use them to get from one spot to the next  isnt going to blow you away, but its intuitive enough that youll be able to get the hang of it fairly quickly, and it never gets in its own way.AndI dont know, thats pretty much all there is to Mekabolt. Its not like it contains any hidden depths that reveal themselves the more you play. What you see is exactly what you get, in all its retro-y, pixelated, brightly-coloured glory. At around $5, youll get what you pay for, as long as youre paying for a solidly unspectacular platformer that does its thing with a minimum of fuss.", "date": "September 23, 2019", "grade": "B"}
