{"name": "Mafia III", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/10/mafia-iii-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "Im hesitant to play armchair psychiatrist, but the more I play Mafia III, the more I get the sense that the developers at Hangar 13 very much had the criticisms leveled against Mafia II in mind the entire time they were developing it. If youll recall, that second game in the Mafia series was roundly criticized for being devoid of interesting content. It set you down in this gorgeous reimagining of post-war New York City (renamed Empire Bay), then gave you absolutely nothing to do. The city was totally empty, and the plot was basically GTA pushed through a 1950s filter, only with characters that werent anywhere near as memorable.Mafia III very clearly sets out to address all these issues. The game is set in New Orleans stand-in New Bordeaux, and the place is bustling with life. There are people everywhere you go at all hours of the day, and you cant go a block without stumbling across something to do, whether its a mission or simply a collectible worth picking up. Not only that, Mafia III gets the sounds of the era right, with a couple of radio stations and a soundtrack that have no problem getting you in just the right mindset to play a game set in 1968.Even more importantly, you couldnt ask for a more compelling main character than Lincoln Clay. Hes well-written and well-acted, and hes got a story so compelling and so well-presented that you cant help but get caught up in his quest for vengeance. In all honesty, if Mafia III were only 8-hours-long and focused solely on Clays narrative, itd be a strong contender for game of the year  thats just how amazing its story is. Basically, from an aesthetic perspective and from a storytelling perspective, I dont think you could ask for a better game than this one.The thing is, Mafia III isnt a tightly-plotted, eight-hour narrative adventure. Instead, its more an open-world sandbox, and you quickly learn that even if theres more to do, theres not necessarily more stuff worth doing. Most of the items youll collect will be money, which, while somewhat useful, isnt a super-compelling reason to make you stop every few blocks to see whats hidden away. Likewise, while there may be more quests and missions, a lot of them are pretty similar, and essentially require you to go back and forth across the same well-trodden ground to kill the same identical-looking enemies repeatedly. For a game with so much flair and personality on the macro level, its a shame that the same level of care and attention wasnt put into the micro level, too. In other words, Mafia III isnt all that different from Mafia II: it looks great, but its all a little empty when you scratch past the surface.", "date": "October 17, 2016", "grade": "B+"}
