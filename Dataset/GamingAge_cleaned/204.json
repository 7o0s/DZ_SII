{"name": "Super Weekend Mode", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/04/super-weekend-mode-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch-xbox-one/", "text": "A simple test to see whether youll be able to play  and, consequently, enjoy  Super Weekend Mode: can you do the rub your tummy/pat your head at the same time thing? If you can, then you might find this fun. If you cant, look away now, because youll stand no chance of succeeding here.This may seem like a crazy thing to say, but its the best way I can think of describing this game. Super Weekend Mode is an interesting take on shmups, where you have two pads at the bottom, and you use them to shoot a bad guy, catch hearts, bump bunnies, and avoid skulls. The key thing to know is that the pads move independently of each other, and while theres some rhythm to the way the hearts/bunnies/skulls cascade down the screen, as the game gets more difficult, the two sides of the screen mirror each other less and less.  As you can imagine, the faster the items fall, the harder it becomes to quickly click the two shoulder buttons independently of each other  hence the head/tummy trick mentioned above. If youre fine with that, though, thenwell, youll probably still find this game odd, because thats what it is. In theory, Super Weekend Mode is about a girl chasing a thief through dungeons, but the only way youll know that is from reading its store description. Going just by whats in the game itself, all youll see is lots of bright, flashing, occasionally cutesy things flying across the screen, set to hyperactive chiptunes. Theres a tutorial that doesnt explain much, and even if you read it, youll probably be better off just playing the game and seeing if you can figure things out that way. Should you play Super Weekend Mode, though? That largely goes up to the test I mentioned up top  along with the equally important question of how much you can tolerate games that are bright and hyperactive. (And, if youre playing it on PS4 or Vita and youre a Trophy hunter, its also worth taking into account you should be able to get this Platinum in under 20 minutes.) If youre fine with all those things, then it may just be worth checking it out.", "date": "April 26, 2019", "grade": "B"}
