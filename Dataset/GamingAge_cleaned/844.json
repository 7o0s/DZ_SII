Dont take that the wrong way  I was one of those dozen people who bought, played, and enjoyed it on the Wii U, Im not trying to disparage the game or Nintendos most lacklustre console. I just mean that given how much fun Lego City Undercover is, its nice to see it get a chance at the kind of audience it deserved in the first place.Its one of those games where the hook is instantly obvious: its Grand Theft Auto, as told through a Lego filter. Sure, youre playing as a cop instead of a criminal, but beyond that, its not all that different. You get to explore a wide open world thats full of secrets waiting for you to discover. You can hijack every single car you see, and thanks to the fact youre a cop, you can do so with zero repercussions. You even get to arrest clowns and rescue pigs.Okay, that last part is different from GTA. But thats where the Lego filter comes in. Even as it borrows a lot of the language and beats youd associate with Grand Theft Auto or one of its lesser imitators, Lego City Undercover is still undeniably a Lego game. Destroying parts of your environment isnt just an option, its necessary if you want to build ferries and trains that will open up new parts of the world for you. Similarly, Lego City is packed with the kind of visual gags and jokes youd associate with Lego games, and its all delivered in a way thats consistent with the franchises usual approach to humour. Best of all, Lego City Undercover packages everything up via easily-digestible chapters, meaning that if you want an open world game that doesnt feel unmanageably huge, youll be gently nudged here and there towards what you need to do next.Actually, thats not the best thing about Lego City Undercover. No, what stands out most for me is that it looks so, so, so much better than it did on Wii U. Given the differences between PS4 and Wii U, that should almost go without saying, but Ill say it anyway. Its nice to play a game as bright and visually appealing as this, and not have it look muddy or indistinct.", "date": "May 12, 2017", "grade": "A"}
