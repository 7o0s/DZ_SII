Couple that with the fact that I knew the game was a visual novel developed by Winter Wolves, and I instantly got flashbacks to the last game of theirs I played with similar vibes, Roommates  though given how terrible that game was, PTSD may be a more appropriate description for my reaction than flashbacks.Once I actually started playing the game, however, I soon learned that the comparison doesnt totally work. Yes, C14 Dating looks awfully similar to Roommates, and yes, its also a dating game, but if you look beyond those two things, youll find that C14 Dating is a little more complex  and, thankfully, a little better.The reason for this is related to the games name. C14 Datings name is a not-so-subtle reference to the other name for radiocarbon dating in archaeology. And, as you very quickly discover, the game is about a student participating in a summer archaeology internship in Belgium.Shockingly, the internship is actually highly relevant to the game itself. See, unusually for a dating game, C14 Dating allows you to either pursue a romance with one of the other internsor, if you want, take your studies seriously and spend the game focusing on your work. Admittedly, even in the second stream youre still expected to befriend at least one other student, but its still kind of refreshing to see a dating game thats not all about dating.I should probably note that regardless of which path you choose, youre not going to be exposed to world-class writing or anything. C14 Dating may be better than other Winter Wolves visual novels, but thats an incredibly low bar. In fact, your options are either romance a bland hunk (or, if you prefer, a bland hottie), or spend your summer studying, and neither is all that interesting.Still, seeing as I went into C14 Dating expecting offensive stereotypes and even more offensive music (seriously, Roommates grating pop-punk still haunts me), it counts as a win that I mostly avoided those things. C14 isnt the greatest visual novel Ive ever played, but its not the worst by a long shot, and given the developers track record Ill count that as a positive.", "date": "May 26, 2021", "grade": "C+"}
