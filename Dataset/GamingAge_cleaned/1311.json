{"name": "NHL 16", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/09/nhl-16-review-for-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "Im kind of a terrible Canadian. I dont think Ive ever rolled up the rim to win at Tim Hortons, and Im positive Ive never had a double-double there. I dont buy my milk in bags. I have no opinion on the merits on Canadian vs American beer. And, above all else, I dont care about hockey: I dont watch Hockey Night in Canada, I think Don Cherry is a national disgrace, and I honestly have no idea how Canada fared at the last Winter Olympics.Youd think, then, that I would hate NHL 16  or, at the very least, you might expect me to be indifferent to it. And yet, that couldnt be further from the truth.See, throughout my time with NHL 16, I kept having to fight the urge to stop playing and just watch it all unfold in front of me. Watch as my teammates moved the puck around the ice with clockwork precision. Watch as opposing defenders feebly waved their sticks at an impressive display of skating. Watch as my teammates lit up the red light time and time again, running up the score against hapless opponents. When this game clicks  and make no mistake, it clicks pretty often  its a thing of beauty to behold.Its only slightly less impressive when youre actually playing it  though, to be fair, this may be because my created player wasnt as talented as some of her teammates. NHL 16 slows down the tempo ever-so-slightly when your player is on the ice, perhaps because theres no way you could possibly move as impressively as your CPU-controlled teammates. Nonetheless, even at that slower speed, things still move at a crisp pace, making it really easy to get sucked in to the fast-paced beauty of it all.(Side note: I find it bizarre that, as in previous iterations of the franchise, theres the option to make created players female, but the announcers never seem to acknowledge that fact. Its like EA Sports decided theyd make the game inclusive, but somehow do that in the least inclusive way possible.)What really impresses me, though, is that the games speed doesnt substantially slow down in online multiplayer. Maybe years of abysmal online play in MLB: The Show have left me jaded, but Im just not used to playing a sports game online thats free of weird glitches and slowdowns. NHL 16 has no issues that I could see, which kind of blows my mind.And speaking of comparisons to The Show, NHL 16 also impressed me with its approach to the whole Ultimate Team concept. Im used to the ridiculous difficulty and lousy packs of player cards that The Show throws at you, which meant I was totally unprepared for how fair and easy-to-use the NHL 16 equivalent is. It makes me want to give it the highest compliment possible: it just works, and its intuitive, which are two qualities that a lot of games, sports and otherwise, can sometimes forget to include.", "date": "September 29, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
