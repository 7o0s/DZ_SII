{"name": "Firewatch", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/02/firewatch-review-ps4-pc/", "text": "Ive never been what youd call an outdoorsy person. Ive never gone camping in my life. Ive never been in a tent. Ive gone hiking, like, once in my 35 years of living.In other words, it doesnt take much for Firewatch to put me in an uneasy state of mind. You play as a forest ranger, Hank, isolated in the Wyoming wilderness, with nothing but a voice at the other end of a radio to keep you company. Between the overabundance of nature and the near-total lack of other people, were already basically talking one of my nightmare scenarios, so its not like Firewatch had that far to go in terms of getting me into the right mindset.Even if I wasnt pathologically put off by the wild, however, I have a feeling Firewatch still wouldve had me feeling tense and nervous in no time. For one thing, it has a score thats perfectly suited for that purpose: hauntingly sparse guitar that wafts in and out of your consciousness, never quite resolving into an obvious melody, leaving you subconsciously unsure of whats coming next. Couple that with forest noises that sound ever-more-ominous as the story progresses, and you can see how Firewatch gets you off-kilter in that regard.On top of that, the game has a setting thats conducive to creeping unease. Like I said, nature has never been my kind of thing, but I suspect that all but the most woodsy nature-lovers would find this empty Wyoming forest a little disconcerting. You never see any animals. People are something you experience either at a distance, over the radio, or via lost and forgotten mementos left behind. Even though youre equipped with a map and a compass, its awfully easy to get lost amongst all the winding trails  and it doesnt get any easier as the game progresses and (spoiler, sort of) you have to deal with deteriorating weather conditions. All of this adds together to create a tense, claustrophobic environment  not the sort of atmosphere one usually associates with the great outdoors, but this shows that theres no contradiction.Above all else, though, Firewatch has an amazing story. I dont want to say anything about it for fear of spoiling it, but I will say that this games narrative carries more emotional heft than almost anything else Ive ever played. When (again, kind-of-spoiler alert) a game hits you with the spectre of early-onset dementia just moments after you begin playing, you know youre in for dealing with topics that arent usually broached by games, and that feeling carries itself all the way through to the games conclusion.In this respect, Firewatch is helped immensely by some pretty impressive voice acting performances. Considering that Rich Sommer (voicing Hank) and Cissy Jones (as Delilah) are essentially called upon to carry the entire plot on the strength of how well they read their lines, this game lives or dies on how well they fit into their roles  and the fact it lives and breathes and feels real is a testament to their successes. I dont usually notice the quality of voice acting in my games, so for me to notice it here should give you some idea of how strong both Sommer and Jones are in their roles.Having said all that, Firewatch does have a few flaws. On PS4, at least, it occasionally stutters when you run for an extended period of time. In fact, the game once froze up on me entirely right at a crucial juncture near the end  which, aside from being annoying, wasnt so great for my nerves. Its not so terrible that the game is unplayable, but chances are youll notice it, which means its worth at least mentioning.On top of thatwell, I cant really get into it without spoiling the story. All in all, I think Firewatch tells you what it needs to in order to wrap its story up, but at the same time, I think it features a few red herring plot points that probably couldve been left out. On the one hand, they add to the games overall vibe, but on the other, everything else about Firewatch is so neatly put together, for there to be seemingly loose threads diminishes the effect ever-so-slightly.", "date": "February 10, 2016", "grade": "A+"}
