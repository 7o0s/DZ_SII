{"name": "Diablo III: Rise of the Necromancer", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/07/diablo-iii-rise-necromancer-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Its been a couple weeks now since Blizzard launched the Rise of the Necromancer character pack for Diablo III, and Ive spent what I feel is ample time with the class since that launch. And quite frankly, the addition of Necromancers to Diablo III has been pulled off without a hitch. Its a great addition to a game that Ive put a 1000 plus hours into already, giving me an even bigger excuse to keep playing as we head into the 11th Season this week.This isnt necessarily a hefty addition to the game, but there are a few other perks included besides the actual class. The most notable are more character slots and more stash tabs, two things that Im always in desperate need of. To go along with that, youll get a new portrait frame, new banner, new pet, and a handful of other cosmetic items. And of course, when the pack went live, an update went out to everyone that has Reaper of Souls, which added in the Necromancer set items and legendaries, but also added new zones, challenge rifts, and a few other minor features.As far as the actual class goes, the Necromancer actually does feel unique, and like a worthy addition to the game. My fear was that theyd be a bit too similar to the pet-heavy Witch Doctor class, but I have not found that to be the case. The one pet focused set in the game certainly stands out against the Witch Doctor, but its the other major builds that focus on bone armor and using life for damage that help the Necromancer class stand apart from its brethren.I also love the look of the class, in particular the new armor sets. The Inarius set looks amazing, even with the default colors, but honestly pretty much all of the four new sets look great. And the scythe weapons introduced here look stellar, and have quickly become some of my favorites in the game. Id also give props to the new voicework in the game, which is maybe a bit cheesy, but in the best way possible.", "date": "July 18, 2017", "grade": "A"}
