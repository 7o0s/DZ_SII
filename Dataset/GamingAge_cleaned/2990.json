I mean, its a procedurally generated sailing game that puts a heavy emphasis on naval battles and that features only the vaguest of plots. Given I like my games to be linear and story-focused and I hate water levels, I was a little worried I was letting myself be carried away by the cute-looking graphics.Turns out that I love Sail Forth. Its nice to be wrong sometimes.Whats more, I love it not despite the elements I thought Id dislike, but because of them. Take the procedurally generated world, for example: for the most part, its an absolute joy to simply sail around the map, seeing what new islands youll stumble (er, sail?) across. The game makes it very easy to drift across the high seas, letting the wind take you and your small fleet wherever it may. Whats more, its absolutely gorgeous, with a nautical world thats a riot of colours that change with the different times of day and weather.It also helps that the world has just enough things to do to keep you engaged, but not so much that youll feel like youre on a never-ending series of fetch quests. Youll come across pirates with whom youll engage in sea battles, spots for fishing, seafolk who just want to chat, other ships to race against, and a variety of other activities that make Sail Forths world seem alive.The thing that may surprise me most, though, is that I love the game even though it has some obvious flaws. While theres nothing more fun than having your ship fly across the waves at top speed, the wind in its sails, its a lot less fun when youre trying to sail into a headwind, and you just kind of list along slowly, trying to turn your sails in a way that makes you move at all. Similarly, even though the ships are small, turning them takes a fair amount of effort, which means that when youre in those naval battles, if someone gets on a side of you that isnt well-armed, itll take a few moments to get your ship turned to safety. But even with that minor annoyance, I still loved playing Sail Forth. Its a gorgeous, relaxing game that changes every time you play it, and its got a world thats easy to get immersed in.", "date": "January 18, 2023", "grade": "A-"}
