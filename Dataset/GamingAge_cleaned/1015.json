{"name": "Bioshock: The Collection", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/bioshock-collection-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Bioshock has finally come to the PS4 and Xbox One but its unfortunately not a brand new title in the series. Like so many other games before it, Bioshock The Collection brings together last-gen games and throws them on current-gen systems. I, your resident remaster reviewer (Triple R), will guide you through Rapture and Columbia and tell you if its a worth while journey. The Bioshock franchise is one of my favorites of any console generation, so I was extremely eager to see how they played years later.For those that havent stumbled across any lighthouses, this collection includes; Bioshock, Bioshock 2 and Bioshock Infinite. Also included are the great DLC packs; Minervas Den (from Bioshock 2) and Burial at Sea (from Bioshock Infinite). Brand new directors commentary from Ken Levine are also added into the original Bioshock via hidden film reel items placed throughout the game. So as far as content, theres plenty, it just doesnt happen to feature much of anything new.Like all remastered game rereleases or collections, Bioshock The Collection boasts better graphics and frame rates. While that is true, each game included in the collection doesnt receive the same treatment. Bioshock Infinite, the most recently released game, is the least changed and mostly resembles the high-res PC version of the game. Bioshock 2 shows some improvements in lighting and textures but nothing too drastic. The original Bioshock gets the most love and it shows. So not only does it get the new directors commentary, it also has the most visual upgrades. Playing through the original Bioshock again didnt feel like playing a game that was over 9 years old. It doesnt look as incredible as something like Rise of the Tomb Raider or Uncharted 4 but it still looks damn good for a remaster of a nearly decade old game. Dare I say, it looks as good (if not a bit better) than some brand new releases.Meanwhile, the gameplay and controls of the collection are left almost entirely unchanged for better or worse. While I would have liked some changes to at least be offered, like dual wielding plasmids and guns in the original Bioshock, I understand why no changes were made. Like a majority of remasters and collections that have been released lately, this is a set thats kind of take it or leave it and you know exactly what youre getting when you buy it. I think its fair to say that Im a fanboy of the Bioshock franchise and this review might come off biased, but this collection should be in every serious gamers library.", "date": "September 21, 2016", "grade": "A"}
