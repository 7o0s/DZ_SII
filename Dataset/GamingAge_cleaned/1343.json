{"name": "The Quiet Collection", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/the-quiet-collection-review-for-ps-vita-wii-u/", "text": "Ah, PlayStation Mobile: an extremely niche idea on a fairly niche platform. Even for someone as dedicated to the Vita as I am, I cant say I spent too much time browsing its storefront  though in my defense, it was awfully easy to miss, tucked away as it was in a little corner of the handhelds PlayStation Store. And now its gone, only to be remembered by people who were able to snag a few games before it quietly closed its e-doors a few months ago.While PSMs selection was generally lacking, there were still some pretty fun games to be found. Just off the top of my head, Pop Bug Zap was ridiculously addictive, Passing Time offered a neat twist on soccer, Haunt the House: Terrortown was adorably scary and Life of Pixel did hard-as-nails retro platformer better than most other games of that ilk.There was one series of games that I never touched, though: the Quiet games from Nostatic Software. Every single time one of them would pop up on the new release list, Id overlook them in favour ofwell, not quite something flashier (PSM was, after all, mostly lacking in that department), but in favour of games that promised a little more than they did.Now that Ive actually played them all  since they handily come in one package via The Quiet Collection  Im wishing Id had the opportunity to send a few dollars Nostatic Softwares way back when they were PlayStation Mobile-only. These four games (Quiet Please, Quiet Christmas, Vacation Vexation and Candy Please) are the embodiment of everything PlayStation Mobile couldve/shouldve been: fun little experiences on par with the some of the better games youd find on other mobile platforms, only with the added benefit of buttons. Not that The Quiet Collection really calls for buttons, mind you. All four titles are pretty straightforward adventure games, which means youll spend most of your time with them walking to Point A, picking up an item that will help you access Point B, and then using whatever you find there to take you on to Point C. All four games are about helping a teenage girl achieve fairly simple objectives (first she wants a quiet house, then she wants her house to be ready for Christmas, then shes preparing for Halloween, then shes on vacation). It takes a little bit of brain power, for sure, but as far as controls go, its not exactly the sort of thing that demands you play with a thumbstick and the circle-square-triangle-x configuration. Im glad I can, since Ive never been too fond of touchscreen-only gaming, but its not essential.Then again, neither are the games that make up The Quiet Collection. Theyre good for what they are, dont get me wrong, but its important you dont go in expecting them to be anything other than bite-sized experiences you should be able to hurry through in a single commute. Admittedly, that may depend on the length of your commute when it comes to Candy Please and Vacation Vexation, since theyre geared towards a slightly longer sitting, but theyre still the kind of games you should be able to beat without devoting too much time to them.", "date": "August 31, 2015", "grade": "A-"}
