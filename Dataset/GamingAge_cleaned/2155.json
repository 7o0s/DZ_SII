{"name": "Black Knight Sword", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/12/black-knight-sword-review-for-psn-xbla/", "text": "I tend to enjoy just about everything that developer Grasshopper Manufacture lends their name to, but Ill admit that I found Black Knight Sword fell a little flat for me. I love to check out throwback games, and BKS certainly does evoke a 16-bit action platformer throughout its five stages, but the required weirdness that youd typically see in a Grasshopper game actually goes to such an extreme here that it becomes largely forgettable and tiring as opposed to anything interesting and new. And the core gameplay, largely focused on swatting down relatively weak and mindless enemies with sword swipe after sword swipe, gets to be monotonous way too early, despite BKS being a relatively short experience.In Black Knight Sword, youll take control of the titular Black Knight, given access to a sword that doubles as some sort of spirit called the Black Hellebore. Besides acting as your primary weapon, you can use Black Hellebore as a limited projectile, and the Hellebore also grants you the ability to double jump. BKS features a lot of platforming elements, tricky jumps, bottomless pits, and other hazards, and for the most part the controls work well enough to keep the experience from being frustrating. Theres just the right amount of weight given to jumps to keep them feeling like precise movements, and if I ever got mad at the game, it had little to do with the character physics or platforming side of things.But the level design doesnt really do enough to complement the controls. There are a lot of sections throughout the five stages that require little more effort than just pushing forward and either hacking at foes that require little skill to defeat, or jumping from one nearby platform to another. BKS can be difficult at times, mostly due to not giving you much more than a backwards roll as a form of evading enemy projectiles, but that challenge is typically only present during the boss fights and mid-boss fights youll encounter. The rest of the stages are honestly sort of boring, and despite being wacky and weird, fail to be memorable. Theres one sequence in the third stage does stand out, where the mechanics of the game completely change gears, but that sequence is more of outlier than anything else.", "date": "December 17, 2012", "grade": "C+"}
