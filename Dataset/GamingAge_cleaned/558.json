{"name": "Timothy vs the Aliens", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/04/timothy-vs-the-aliens-review-for-ps4-pc/", "text": "At first glance, Timothy vs the Aliens looks kind of promising. Its an open-world gangster game where you play as the titular Timothy, defending the Earth against an alien invasion. Throw in a jaunty, jazzy soundtrack and stylish-looking black and white world where the only dashes of colour come from the aforementioned aliens, and it all seems like a recipe for a fun experience.Then the introductory cutscene ends, you start playing, and you discover that the developers crammed every single good idea they had into those first few minutes, and had no idea what to do next. Id say things go downhill quickly, but that would imply some kind of sloped, gradual decline. The problem with Timothy vs the Aliens is that it basically falls off a cliff moments after you start playing.Actually, thats not even totally true. The first sign things arent quite right here is when you boot up the game and discover there are no options. The fact that the game doesnt give you any control over the volume or the brightness reveals itself to be a pretty big drawback almost immediately, when you find out that the musics only level seems to be blaring, and the black and white world is so dark that some places are basically invisible.But Timothy vs the Aliens really hits its terrible stride when you get into the action. That open world? Its actually only a few confusingly laid out city blocks, and the whole game world seems to be populated only by Timothy, a woman, and a crapload of aliens, plus whatever people the plot demands briefly show up. If it werent for the fact that its impossible to go two steps without being besieged by hostile aliens, Little Fish City  the imaginary city in which the game is situated  would essentially be a ghost town.There may not be much to see in Little Fish City, but Timothy vs the Aliens still finds a way to complicate your exploration of the town (hamlet? village?) by including a map thats completely and utterly useless. You cant set waypoints, it doesnt include landmarks (other than your home apartment), and it doesnt tell you where there are random walls that inevitably block you from going anywhere useful.Of course, even if you were able to navigate somewhere interesting, youd still be stuck fighting aliens almost literally every step of the way, since no matter where you go, they immediately swarm you. Which leads me to another of the games many failings: the combat sucks. I see what the games developers were going for: armed with your trusty pistol, you take down alien after alien, with a little help from a super-power that allows you to slow time. What you actually get, though, are ultra-aggressive aliens that show up from out of nowhere and swarm you in groups, and all you have to defend yourself is a crappy little gun that doesnt store nearly enough bullets at a time to be effective against enemies that are essentially bullet sponges, plus a power that wears out almost instantly and takes forever to renew itself. Even the weakest enemies are able to survive three headshots, plus it takes you forever to reload six new bullets into your gun, plus aliens tend to show up in groups of three more more, soyou do the math there. It doesnt exactly work out in your  or the games  favour.Then again, nothing else works out, either. Timothy vs the Aliens is all about missed opportunities and strange choices that transform a game with a promising premise into a giant mess. If you squint hard enough you can see how it couldve worked, but as it stands, youll want to stay far, far away.", "date": "April 11, 2018", "grade": "D"}
