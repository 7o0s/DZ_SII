{"name": "Nurse Love Addiction", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/09/nurse-love-addiction-review-ps-vita-pc/", "text": "You could be forgiven for expecting the worst from Nurse Love Addiction. I know I did. After all, its a visual novel about a group of teenage lesbian nursing students. Given that Japanese games arent exactly known for their sensitivity or maturity when it comes to handling queer characters or LGBTQ issues  or, really, anything involving sex  I was expecting that the only question would be just how offensive it would end up being.You can imagine my surprise when I discovered that the answer is: not very. There are plenty of moments that, in the wrong hands, couldve gone wildly off the rails. Its kind of frightening to think about how, say, Senran Kagura would deal with two girls being caught kissing, or the main character falling onto another girl while both are clad only in nightgowns. Yet, as titillating as you might expect those moments to be, the way Nurse Love Addiction handles them could practically be considered downright chaste. I mean, its not, since it still feels like the game is trying to be vaguely naughty, but as I said, its very easy to imagine things being much, much worse.Of course, this raises another question: is it worse to be wildly offensive, or painfully dull? Because if Im being totally honest here, even if Nurse Love Addiction doesnt offend me, it certainly does bore me. Main character Asuka is a chronic overthinker: she constantly thinks and rethinks her motivations, she agonizes over every social interaction before it happens, and she parses every single thing thats said to her. While I have no doubt that there are many people like that, it doesnt make for a compelling read to slowly forward the text through another one of her freakouts.(Ironically, the game goes to great lengths to portray Asuka as a jellyfish, a person who floats through life without much direction. Whatever she may lack in motivation, I think something like a duck would be a more appropriate spirit animal for the heroine  after all, theres a ridiculous amount of stuff going on beneath the surface.)", "date": "September 12, 2017", "grade": "C+"}
