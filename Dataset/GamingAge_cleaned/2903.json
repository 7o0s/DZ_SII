{"name": "Ultra Hat Dimension", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/ultra-hat-dimension-review-for-ps4-nintendo-switch/", "text": "A lot of the time, when people use retro to describe a game, its simply a byword for incredibly hard. Somehow, games like Ghosts n Goblins and Battletoads have come to represent an entire era, as if the NES had nothing but games that were nearly impossible for anyone but the most skilled gamers.As someone who lived through the era (albeit in my very early years), I know thats not an entirely accurate picture. That system definitely had its share of titles that were tough as nails, but what sticks out most in my memory is the sheer number of weird, quirky, and odd games that came out on the original Nintendo. I remember going to Rogers Video picking out some of the most bizarre games imaginable.I say all this as a prelude to talking about Ultra Hat Dimension so you can understand what I mean when I say this: someone could have told me that Ultra Hat Dimension was a re-release of a long-forgotten NES cult classic, and I would 100% believe it.To some extent, this is because it looks like it came straight out of a world where 8-bit graphics were the height of sophistication. Like, strip away the short bit of animation at the beginning of the games trailer, and you can see how those fairly simple graphics look like the NES wouldve had no problem running the game.But its the story and gameplay where Ultra Hat Dimension really feels like a weird relic of the 80s. You play as Bea, a girl whos been sent to her kingdoms annual hat design competition. On arriving at the castle  which seems to be in another dimension  she discovers that the inhabitants of the castle, weird little blobs called spluffs, have all turned violent, and they punch anyone not wearing the same hat as them.What follows from that is a game where Bea has to find the key and lock in each level, and she has to get punched a whole lot by these spluffs. Luckily theres no health meter, so the only thing stopping you on each level is getting stuck in an endless loop of punching, or running out of hat disguises to help you pass by some especially poorly-placed spluffs. Oh, and you cant punch back, though you can give some of the spluffs a shove if youre wearing the same hat.Like I said, its kind of weird. But its also really fun once you get into it. Each level here is a well-made puzzle, and the developers were smart enough to make it so that there are often multiple ways through any given floor. The game is challenging at times, but never so hard that youll want to throw your controller across the room and give up on the game completely.", "date": "August 18, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
