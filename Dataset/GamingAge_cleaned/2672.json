I mean, it owes a pretty enormous debt to N+, and you play as a pink man. Hence, Pinkman+That said, simply writing Pinkman+ off as an N+ clone does the game a pretty huge disservice  though when I write that, I should probably note that I was one of the few people who didnt love N++.But still, my big issue with N++ was that it was a tough-as-nails platformer that demanded precision, but I found the controls too floaty to fully enjoy the game. Pinkman+ solves this problem perfectly. The levels are a little more forgiving, and the controls feel a little bit tighter, which means that it resolves my issues on both ends of the equation.On top of that, the gameplay is a little more varied in Pinkman+, since the eponymous hero also has a jetpack. Its not a very powerful jetpack, mind you, but that small addition opens up some interesting level design  like, for example, when you can chain together little boosts to fly across huge distances, or when it acts as a de facto double jump.Its also worth noting that this game has a pretty nice look and feel. The design is fairly basic, but the colours change every time you start or restart a level, which leads to some nice colour combos. It also pairs really well with the games soundtrack, which consists entirely of pretty chill synthwave.Really, as twitchy platformers go, Pinkman+ does so much right that its easy to fall in love with the game. It doesnt try to do too much, but it does what it does exceedingly well.", "date": "April 24, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
