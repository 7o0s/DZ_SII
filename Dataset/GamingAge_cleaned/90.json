{"name": "Front Mission 1st: Remake", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/12/front-mission-1st-remake-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Front Mission is one of those RPG series that hasnt had the best track record in the West, in part due to the series not seeing a consistent localization effort across the board. We didnt get any version of the original Front Mission until the Nintendo DS port hit in 2007, which was nearly 12 years after the release of the original game on Super Famicom. Front Mission 2 was never localized (but is coming in this wave of remakes, thankfully), Front Mission 3 and 4 did see North American releases, but then Front Mission 5 skipped us by. It also doesnt help that some of the Front Mission titles that have been released in North America arent necessarily the best representation of the series, with the last related release being the abysmal Left Alive from 2019.Thankfully, Front Mission 1st: Remake seems to mark a possible resurgence for the strategy mech RPG in the West, and while Id like to have seen a little more done with the concept of a remake here, I still enjoyed my time spent with one of the two campaigns for this review. Its not perfect by any stretch, but it was nice to revisit the original game again.In Front Mission 1st: Remake, youll take on the role of a Wanzer pilot, giving you two lengthy campaigns to check out that tell a war story from both sides of the conflict. Wanzers are essentially giant mecha, not unlike your standard Gundam or Macross style robot, but maybe a little less flashy and more industrial in design than those popularized in anime media. As you advance through the story, you can purchase a variety of parts and weapons for your Wanzer, which will affect not only its attack and defensive stats, but how it looks in battle. You can also opt to choose from a number of unique colors for each Wanzer in your party, in order to help them stand out from one another on the battlefield. While Front Mission 1st: Remake is no graphical powerhouse, the designs used here are sharp and visually appealing, even when scaled down to a smaller size during battle.While there is a lot of story to uncover in Front Mission 1st: Remake, youll be spending the majority of your time in battle with opposing Wanzer units. At the onset of a battle, youll be able to choose a number of Wanzers and their respective pilots to take with you into a fight, with each battle placing some sort of restriction on how many party members can join you. Once all units are selected the battle will begin, with you and your opponent taking turns moving units along tiles in the environment and then ideally lining up attacks or using items before ending your turn. If youve ever played any sort of tile-based strategy RPG in the past, Front Mission 1st: Remake will feel instantly familiar. It doesnt have a lot of mechanics beyond enemy placement though, there are some limited effects from the environment regarding cover and chance-to-hit, but its not particularly deep or worth paying attention to. Due to this, veteran strategy RPG fans may find the combat to be a little bland, but I think theres enough of a challenge present throughout Front Mission 1st: Remake to hold your attention.As far as complaints, most of my issues with Front Mission 1st: Remake stem from calling it a remake. Remaster may have been a more appropriate term to use here, as the game does have a fresh coat of paint for sure, but the underlying mechanics are largely unchanged from the prior Nintendo DS release. The user interface is a little clunky, youll spend too much time in-between missions buying parts and upgrading Wanzers, and theres little need to explore around the menu and talk to NPCs unless youre simply looking for some additional world-building flavor text. Front Missions 1st: Remake sticks with the random targeting that the original game has, which means that when you fire your weapon at an opposing Wanzer, you have no option to pick legs, arms, or body. This element of chance will likely frustrate new players, and while your pilots will gain skills that eventually do let you choose parts, it takes a decent amount of time to unlock those skills and the game does a poor job letting you know that those skills are coming, or when they unlock for each pilot.All in all, Front Mission 1st: Remake would probably have benefited from a more concentrated effort on quality of life improvements as youll likely encounter a lot of little things that feel sort of archaic by modern standards as you progress. There isnt any one major issue here, its absolutely playable and enjoyable as is, but Id expect more out of an actual remake.", "date": "December 12, 2022", "grade": "B"}
