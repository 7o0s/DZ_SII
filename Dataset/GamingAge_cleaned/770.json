Like, the entire franchise, in all its 30-year glory. I enjoyed 2013s A Link Between Worlds for reasons that are now lost to me, but beyond that, my general reaction to Zelda games has been, at best, a shrug.Consequently, youd probably expect that Id greet Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas with indifference. After all, depending on your perspective, its either a loving homage to or a blatant rip-off of the Zelda series. As my colleague Tyler pointed out in his review of the game on Xbox, nearly everything about it, from the hero (a young boy/man), to the plot (youre fighting an evil that has plagued the land for generations), to the combat, to the life displayed as hearts in the top corner, right down to the fact that blue crystals spill from broken pots and cut shrubs, owes a pretty clear debt to Nintendos venerable franchise.And yet, despite the many (many!) similarities, I find myself enjoying Oceanhorn in a way that, A Link Between Worlds notwithstanding, I never have with Zelda.I dont need to think very hard to figure out why that is, either. As Tyler noted, on a console, Oceanhorn probably comes off as a somewhat shallow experience. On a handheld like the Vita, however, you basically get to experience the game as it was meant to be played. After all, the game got its start in the mobile realm; its not a huge stretch to see that the distance between a Vita and an iPhone is much less than the gulf between an iPhone and an Xbox. On top of that  from a purely personal perspective  its no coincidence that the only Zelda game Ive ever liked also happens to be the only one I ever played on a handheld system (and that, in general, I tend to prefer handheld games).What does that mean in practice? In part, I guess, its an admission that Oceanhorn probably isnt on par with, say, Skyrim (or even Breath of the Wild), content-wise. At the same time, though, its also a recognition that mobile gaming is a very different beast than what you get on consoles, and by that measure, Oceanhorn is near-perfect. The worlds are essentially distinctive islands, which means youre never going to have to worry about keeping track of a giant map. None of the islands are particularly huge, so you dont have to worry about jumping in and out of the game and not knowing where you are. The game also helpfully lets you know what youve achieved on each island by percentage, so completists should be pleased.Most importantly, though, it means that Oceanhorn can be consumed in easily-digestible chunks. There are lots of puzzles to solve and enemies to engage in combat, but neither of those things are so time-consuming that youll be in trouble if you need to put your Vita to sleep as you, say, suddenly have to jump out of your seat and run off the bus or subway.I wouldnt say that Oceanhorn is flawless, mind you. Its a little stingy when it comes to save points, which is kind of annoying if you want to, you know, save your game, rather than just putting your Vita to sleep.
