And by it, of course, I mean that theyve continued their unfortunate habit of allowing players to unlock a Platinum trophy well before the end of the game, thereby removing a lot of the incentive to stick around the end.Mind you, Dojoran might just be the most egregious example Ive seen of this. There are 28 levels in the game, and the Platinum pops after just five. Sure, you also need to die 25 times, collect 150 coins, and find 5 special Talismans, but none of those things requires you going out of your way, which means you get all the trophies here in well under half an hour.Whats unfortunate about this is that Dojoran is one of the better Ratalaika-published games that Ive played in quite some time (and Ive played quite a few). Its a kinda-tough-as-nails platformer thats a lot fairer than many other games in that genre  by which I mean it calls on players to have solid reflexes and to make some challenging jumps, but it never feels like its punishing players for thinking they have a chance at beating the game. No matter how many times I died, I always found that I could see exactly what the game wanted me to do, and I never wanted to throw my controller away in frustration.Which isnt to say that Dojoran doesnt feature the odd frustrating moment. There were definitely places where I realized Id screwed up carrying an important item, and I had to start the level over again to get around my mistake. Still, those moments were few and far between, and were far outnumbered by levels that were actually fun to play.Just about my only real quibble with Dojoran is in how it describes itself. It claims its a 1-bit platformer, but thats kind of a misnomer. For me, when I think of those, I think of games like Zero Zero Zero Zero, that really do look 1-bit, to the point they couldve come out on one of gamings earliest systems. Dojoran, by contrast, may have a black-and-white colour palette, but it still looks like a more modern game.As I said, though, thats just a quibble. Dojoran is a fun platformer  whether you want to play it until the Platinum pops, or if you keep on playing beyond that point.", "date": "February 8, 2022", "grade": "B+"}
