Its about 4-5 hours long, but thanks to the way every scene seems to naturally lead into the next, it feels like it goes by much faster than that. Given its pedigree, this isnt a huge surprise. It was written by Rhianna Pratchett, who isnt just the daughter of legendary fantasy writer Terry Pratchett, but also a pretty accomplished game writer in her own right with a list of credits that includes games like the rebooted Tomb Raider, Mirrors Edge, and Heavenly Sword, among others. Lost Words structure itself also lends itself pretty well to that kind of flow. Its the story of a young girl who builds a fantasy world with her grandmother, only for her grandmother to fall ill. Rather than cutscenes or discrete levels, however, the whole thing is presented as a diary, where the main character cuts from real life to the fantasy world and back again, and she runs across the page as the story is told. Seeing as were almost literally talking about a book, it makes sense that it would flow pretty smoothly.Mind you, the trade off for that flow is that the game isnt a huge challenge. There are plenty of environmental puzzles to be solved, but they pretty much all involve picking the right words in order to progress  whether its stepping on the right highlighted word, or picking a word like repair in order to fix the path ahead. There are only a couple of places where youll need to pause and think about what youre doing.But, I mean, thats kind of the point of any good fiction, right? If youre actively taken out of a story by thinking about the mechanics of it all, then the story hasnt done a great job of hooking you in. Lost Words may not be the greatest fiction youll ever read, but it will keep you hooked from the first to last page, and in this case, thats enough.", "date": "April 29, 2021", "grade": "B+"}
