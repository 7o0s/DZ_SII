{"name": "The Walking Dead: Michonne Give No Shelter", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/04/walking-dead-michonne-give-no-shelter-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "The second chapter of the Michonne focused 3-parter from Telltale Games picks up right where the first episode left off. Michonne, Sam, and Pete are in a precarious position, made even more dangerous by Sam and Michonnes recent escape attempt, and Gregs unfortunate demise. Now faced with the possibility of escape from Norma and her brother Randall, youll need to make a series of decisions that attempt to ensure the survival of everyone involved.As far as middle chapters go, Give No Shelter is decent, but doesnt provide a whole lot of insight into Michonnes pre-Rick existence. Youll get one flashback sequence that unfortunately doesnt seem to add much to the tale. More of this chapters focus is on current events, which introduces a few new characters. However, none of these new faces are exactly on par with the existing cast, and were not given enough time to care about any of them before theyre immediately put in harms way.The only real standout moment is the end of the episode, where Michonne is faced with a decision that either allows her to deviate from the person she thinks she is, or allows her to dive a bit deeper into the violent haze that surrounds her persona. Its a tough choice because one person certainly has something coming to them, but at the same time you get the feeling that its a step too far, and not entirely necessary considering the helplessness of that individual in the moment.Still, that one moment doesnt entirely redeem the hour or so itll take to play through the episode. This is, for me, one of the weaker episodes across the board for all of Telltales Walking Dead games. It felt rushed from a story perspective, with not enough time to linger on action or decisions. Character and world building was virtually non-existent. We get a moment or two of background info on Sam, but even thats pretty fleeting. And the flashback sequence offered no additional insight that hadnt been revealed from the previous ep.", "date": "April 6, 2016", "grade": "C+"}
