{"name": "Antiquia Lost", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/01/antiquia-lost-review-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "While I wouldnt say I was excited to play Antiquia Lost, I went into it with moderately high expectations. After all, my previous two experiences with Kemco-produced RPGs, Asdivine Hearts and Revenant Saga, both went pretty well. Both of them looked like generic old-school RPGs, but I found things to like, particularly in the latter. I had hopes that Antiquia Lost would carry on in that tradition.Unfortunately, to borrow a phrase, sometimes a generic-looking old-school RPG is just a generic-looking old-school RPG. Antiquia Lost takes all the elements of an RPG you couldve played at any point in time going back to the NES days, andwell, thats all it does.Theres a party full of standard RPG tropes: a hero with a mysterious past/power, a princess, a soldier, and so on. Theres an overworld map you travel around, looking for points of interest. Theres a convoluted, text-heavy story that does little to draw you in. There are uninspired turn-based battles, which you can push through just by pressing attack on every turn.To be sure, nothing here is necessarily bad. Every aspect of the game is competently-made, if wholly uninspired. Antiquia Lost is totally functional, and you can get from beginning to end without the game ever breaking on you.But that leads to the bigger question of why youd want to go from beginning to end. I get that some people just live to play retro RPGs, but Id hope that even these people have better taste than to play something as forgettable as Antiquia Lost.", "date": "January 31, 2018", "grade": "C-"}
