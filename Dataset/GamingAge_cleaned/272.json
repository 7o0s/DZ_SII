{"name": "Gal Metal", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/02/gal-metal-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "I think I understand the thought process that went into Gal Metal. Someone, somewhere in Japan, looked at the rhythm game genre and decided they wanted to try something new. They were inspired by the rhythm part of the genre name, took it literally, and  voila!  they decided to make a game where you play as the drummer.(Also, because theyre Japanese, they threw in a plot that involved aliens, high school, and gender-switching, but Ill get into that in a moment.)So I get the how of Gal Metal. What I dont understand is the Why?Dont get me wrong, I understand how important a good drummer is to the success of any band. If you dont have a drummer who can hold a steady beat, youre lacking someone who is almost literally the backbone of your band. As someone who spent a lot of time around musicians during a previous stage of my life, I saw plenty of bands who were dragged down by drummers with no sense of rhythm, and I saw far fewer whose drummers elevated them to bigger and better things.But for the life of me, I cant figure out why anyone would want to play a game as a drummer, as you do in Gal Metal. Apart from maybe the bassist, its the most boring job in a band, since its up to you to keep a steady beat around which everyone else does their part. While theres a little room for improvisation, compared to all the other instruments, theres not a lot to do. And so it is with Gal Metal. As the bands drummer, youre there to keep time. Sure, you can play around on the edges of songs, and its a bit of a challenge to figure out the correct rhythm for every song, but at its core, youre there to make the rest of the band sound good. Unless youre really into drumming, its not the kind of game thats likely to grab your attention or spark your imagination.For that, I guess, theres the story  which isnt exactly great either. The gist of it is that youre playing as a teenage boy whos been swapped into the body of a teenage girl by aliens seeking to destroy the earth, and the only way to fight band is with metal. The story is told by long, boring text conversations with your bandmates, interspersed with comic-style cutscenes. Occasionally you play gigs at which your goal is to rock the aliens to death, but in amongst the gigs you have to do things around town to boost your various stats. None of it is terrible, but neither is any of it so fascinating that youll be rushing through your shows in the hopes of reading more of the story.In other words, Gal Metal is a game where youll probably find yourself playing through the story just to get to music scenes where your goal is to provide a steady, unceasing beat. Not exactly the most thrilling stuff. Different than most other rhythm games, sure  and if you love rhythm games for the rhythms themselves, there might be something interesting here for you  but, all in all, not the kind of thing you need to rush out and buy unless you watched this scene from Freaks and Geeks and closely identified with Jason Segals character.", "date": "February 18, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
