{"name": "NeverEnd", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/10/neverend-review-ps-vita-pc/", "text": "Given that NeverEnd can be had for just a couple of dollars, theres an argument to be made that its quality is secondary to whether it works. I mean, as long as it doesnt crash your Vita or corrupt your memory, it has to be worth $3 ($4, if youre Canadian), right?Turns out the answer is no.NeverEnd is a top-down roguelite dungeon crawler, and literally everything about it is terrible. The graphics are hideous, with everything looking like little blocks. The design is awful: you cant move and wave your weapons at the same time, which means that you need to try and hit your enemies and run awayexcept the controls are mostly non-responsive, which means you can barely do what the game demands of you. The procedurally-generated dungeons are forgettable, little squares with nondescript features that look pretty much identical to each other.Oh, and Im not even sure that its a fully functioning game, seeing as one time I went back to NeverEnd and found that my save file was corrupted for no obvious reason.", "date": "October 24, 2017", "grade": "D-"}
