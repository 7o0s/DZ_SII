{"name": "Apple Slash", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/01/apple-slash-review-for-ps5-4-xbox-series-x-one-switch/", "text": "Apple Slash may not be very long, but it certainly knows how to pack a lot of plot  or at least a lot of personality  into its short runtime. During the thirty minutes or so that it takes to beat the game, you discover that youre an apple, living in a village full of apples, and as their valiant knight protector youre charged with repelling the invaders from your village. Along the way, you have to rescue another apples son, while also finding the secret keys to unlock gates and discovering sentient masks that give you more powers.Its a bit of an odd game, you might say.Its also not entirely finished. As the developer explains on his website, the game is more a proof of concept than anything else, meant to figure out whether theres enough to the idea to turn it into a fuller game.It certainly feels like there is. On top of the zaniness crammed into that first paragraph, theres plenty of hack & slash gameplay. Your apple is armed with not just a typical sword, but a sword that can also double as a lethal boomerang, or turn into a giant killer from the skies. The action gets a bit frantic, as enemies respawn in certain areas very quickly and youre constantly dodging projectiles from frogs that want to kill you. It would be interesting to see some of these ideas fleshed out a little more.Its also worth noting that the game has some pretty interesting aesthetics. Visually, everything is black and white, with a few hints of red, which is certainly pretty striking. On top of that, Apple Slash is scored by a chiptunes soundtrack that does its genre proud.To be sure, if youre looking for something more substantial, Apple Slash isnt it. But if you look at it as a teaser or a prelude for something bigger  which it hopefully is  it certainly seems like the first part of something that could become a truly distinctive experience.", "date": "January 27, 2022", "grade": "B"}
