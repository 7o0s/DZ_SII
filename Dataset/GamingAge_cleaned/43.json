{"name": "Grave Keeper", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/09/grave-keeper-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "About a month ago, I reviewed a game called Trouserheart, and at the time I honestly couldnt imagine playing a more generic hack & slash game. Turns out Im not that imaginative, because Grave Keeper makes Trouserheart seem like the most original, revolutionary thing ever.Like, at least Trouserheart had a bit of a sense of humor to slightly elevate it the tiniest bit above average. Grave Keeper doesnt even have that. Playing as a knight, you hack and slash your way through 30 levels of exactly 15 enemies each, and after every fifth level you fight a boss. Level 31 is the Skeleton Kingand once you beat him, it sends you back to level 1 to start over again.Theres a story, but its barebones and inconsequential. The weapons are nothing interesting. The environments run all the way from dungeon to graveyard. Youll be able to get from level 1 to level 31 in under an hour.What Im getting at is that theres nothing that makes Grave Keeper in any way memorable. Its not even bad. Its just there, a game thatll fill space on your memory card and give you nothing of value in return. Theres really no reason why you should even think about picking it up when you could play literally anything else instead.", "date": "September 27, 2019", "grade": "D+"}
