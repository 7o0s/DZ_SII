{"name": "Super Tennis Blast", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/07/super-tennis-blast-review-for-switch-pc-xbox-one-ps4/", "text": "Super Tennis Blast is basically the inverse of Smoots World Cup Tennis: its incredibly ugly, its short on features, and it plays surprisingly well.That last part is no small thing. If theres one thing Ive noticed in many tennis games, its that they do a lousy job of making the sport seem fun or interesting to play. Super Tennis Blast, by contrast, stands out by virtue of the fact it simply works. In fact, even more than that, it works in a way that seems natural: you see the ball, you hit the ball where you want it to go. That may not sound like much, but, after playing a fair amount of lousy tennis games in the past year, its actually pretty amazing.Whats more, even though theres not a lot to do, what is here is still enough to make a game worthwhile. Maybe its because the developers didnt feel the need to hide their lousy tennis amidst layers and layers of gimmicks, but only having exhibition and career modes (plus one other mode Ill get to in a second) feels like enough when you have a game that isnt actively getting in its own way by piling on layer after layer of extras.And even the one extra  a Super Blast mode  really isnt all that crazy, and still keeps its focus on tennis when you get down to it. Sure, you can make the net change heights and the lines shift around, but you still play a game thats identifiably tennis. At most, the quirky rules only force you to work on aspects of your game, rather than shifting the sport into something its not.To be sure, Super Tennis Blast isnt flawless. Because its so no-frills, the matches and venues and opponents can start to seem the same after awhile. Its hard to have personality when everything is so basic, after all.But that doesnt take away from the fact this is a very solid, well-made tennis game. Super Tennis Blast isnt going to wow you, but compared to its competition, it doesnt need too  simply being competent is more than enough to make it stand out.", "date": "July 1, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
