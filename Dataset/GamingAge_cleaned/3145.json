Its got a whole bunch of ideas, and it throws together genres in a way that you wouldnt normally think of putting together, but I found the whole package a little overwhelming, if Im being completely honest.Of course, thats not necessarily a strike against Foretales. In fact, thats probably more a me problem than a general problem with the game. In cases like this, I always try not allow my own lousiness at a game to interfere with judging whether most people will like it. And, from that perspective, I think theres certainly something here worth investigating if youre looking for something thats a little different than usual.Part of the challenge is trying to explain what, exactly, it is that Foretales does. Clearly, its a card-based RPG, since the whole story unfolds depending on how and where you play your cards. But getting into more detail than that can be a little difficult. For one thing, you dont have all that much control over your deck. The cards here are largely out of your control: there are certain cards available to you at any given time  some actions, some resources  and you can only figure out the order in which you want to play them. Since you dont know whats coming next or whats available, it felt to me like this led to a lot of playing cards and hoping for the best: for example, do you want to use your fame or some food to open a new path, or do you want to save them for bribing guards in one of the many battles that youll come across this game? Without there being a clear route from Point A to Point B, those decisions can be agonizing  and picking incorrectly can very quickly lead to disastrous results. On top of that, Foretales doesnt just have a Point A to Point B kind of story. The way the game unfolds is constantly evolving, with new scenarios becoming available depending on whats happened so far. Right off the bat, for example, you can either help your friend escape from prison or help deal with labour unrest, and your choice will have huge downstream effects in terms of what you can and cant do later on in the game. If youre easily paralyzed by indecision,  in other words, this may not be the game for you.As you can tell, Foretales asks you to think strategically constantly. Some of this is on a turn-to-turn basis, but it goes into overdrive the second you get into one of the many battles that will mark your time with the game. You could, of course, simply run into battle and hope your cards will help you fight your way out, but thats a terrible way to go about things. Instead, you need to figure out when to use your fame to awe enemies, or money or food to bribe them  or when to allow things to escalate to a fight, obviously  and every choice matters, and can very easily lead to bad consequences. Which, I think, is why I disliked this game, and why I think many more people will love Foretales if the give it a chance. Its an interesting take on a formula youd think would be played out by now, done in a way that shows theres life in the card-based genre yet.", "date": "December 27, 2022", "grade": "B"}
