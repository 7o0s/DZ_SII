{"name": "Duck Souls+", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/04/duck-souls-review-for-ps4-ps-vita-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Duck Souls+ is not, as you may hope, a re-imagining of Dark Souls with the titular water fowl in the role of the undead warrior, amazing as that would be. No, its a platformer starring  you guessed it  a duck. The last duck, in fact, setting out on a quest given to him by the ghosts of his duck ancestors to rescue the worlds remaining duck eggs.Even if its hardly a 1:1 match, however, Duck Souls+ still takes at least one cue from the venerable Souls series: its super-hard. Its one of those 2D platformers with short levels where death waits around every corner, and even if you can usually see what the game asks of you, actually doing it is a lot harder.That said, Duck Souls+ sets itself apart from many other platformers of this ilk in its relative fairness. Yes, youll die a lot, but the game gives you the tools you need. The jumps are crisp and precise, with no sliding or floating to cause cheap deaths. Likewise, even if every level features all manner of spikes and disappearing platforms and heat-seeking rockets and whirling lava shooters  to name just a few of the many environmental dangers here  nothing ever seems ridiculously unfair. Theres nothing here that seems impossible right off the bat, which is a nice step up from a lot of these kinds of games. Its just hard.But hard doesnt equal bad, of course. That was true for Dark Souls, and its true for Duck Souls+. Its not like there arent dozens of other tough-as-nails platformers that inhabit the same space, but Duck Souls+ is definitely one of the better ones.", "date": "April 17, 2020", "grade": "A-"}
