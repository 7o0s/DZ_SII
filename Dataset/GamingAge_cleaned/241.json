{"name": "Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker  Special Episode", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/03/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-special-episode-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Captain Toad has been a busy guy lately. First moving Treasure Tracker over to the Switch and 3DS, and now getting a Special Episode DLC expansion for Switch which adds 18 new courses for a grand total of $6. So is it worth your hard-earned dollars or should you save your coin for something else like chewing gum or a shoelace?Well I guess the answer depends on whether youre already a fan of Captain Toad. If you are then you already know you love every corner of its little cube-like levels. And if youre not then the extra levels wont be changing your mind because theyre more of the same stuff the main game has.Now if you want to know a little more then its worth adding that these new levels are more co-op friendly than what the co-op mode accomplish when it was added to the main game. This does mean the duplication berry power is more heavily featured so if youre playing single player then youll be using multiple Toads a fair amount.The new levels are cute as always as this time Toad and Toadette are in pursuit of a crown. Theres even Minecraft and boss fight! The worlds on average feature more boos than ever, and have some well-hidden secrets that will take some effort to uncover. I really like the added challenge or at least having new puzzles to solve which I cant rely on memory to run through. And the last level took me by surprise with how intense it can be.So really the only complaint is that there is a price at all when other games like Mario Tennis and Splatoon 2 get free DLC because everything else is business as usual in the game department. Even Treasure Tracker got a free update in February.On the other hand its a small fee for a budget title, and with enough here to have a good time exploring for an afternoon. And fans of the original game know what the replay value is or isnt like with Captain Toad so if youre going in knowing what to expect then youll be a happy customer with the Special Episode DLC. Its a great addition to a fun game and I like seeing this little port get continued support. Still it might be nice to see a full-fledged sequel if the team comes back with more ideas.", "date": "March 22, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
