{"name": "Velocity 2X", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/09/velocity-2x-review-ps4-ps-vita/", "text": "Initially, I was ready to dismiss Velocity 2X as not much more than a reskinned version of last years Velocity Ultra (which itself was basically a redone version of the PSP Mini game Velocity). Thats not the worst thing in the world to be, of course; Velocity Ultra was a pretty awesome game, and Im always happy to play it again. But still, I was finding it hard to get too excited for a game in which the big draw was bigger explosions.And then the games hero, Lt. Kai Tana, steps out of her ship, and its instantly apparent that theres actually a whole lot more to Velocity 2X than being just an updated version of Velocity Ultra.I mean, it is partially that. You still spend a good chunk of Velocity 2X flying around in a spaceship, blasting away at aliens and picking up survivors. You still get the story told to you via screen after screen of dialogue. Youre still graded for each level with three-star rankings, and you still get to compare scores via online leaderboards. All of that is still here, and just as in Velocity Ultra, its presented with FuturLabs usual fantastic sense of style.What sets Velocity 2X apart, however, is that its just as much a fast-paced, side-scrolling platformer as it is a shmup. No longer are you just zooming around space, youre also running and jumping through a space station. Youre firing bombs at mines and mounted cannons, and youre teleporting through walls. While a lot of the basic mechanics are similar, they still feel fresh and different just because of the fact its not a spaceship doing them, its a person.(And thats without even getting into the fact that said person a woman. Of course, the game doesnt make a big deal about it, and unless youre really obsessive about these sort of things, its not like youll notice it either  but, in its own way, that feels almost as subversive as if it were some big honking deal. I dont want to dwell on this point too much, since Velocity 2X itself doesnt, but still: its pretty cool.)", "date": "September 2, 2014", "grade": "A"}
