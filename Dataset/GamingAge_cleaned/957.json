{"name": "Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/11/call-duty-infinite-warfare-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "It has been a banner year for first-person shooter campaigns, and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare certainly continues the trend set forth by DOOM. For me, the single-player side of Infinite Warfare is one of the best COD campaigns since Black Ops 2, and certainly the most entertaining of the COD modern era. Not only is it often very nice to look at, with some great animations and interesting locales, but it also goes all in on the space warfare side of things that the series has only toyed with over the past couple of entries. And it owns the sci-fi approach for the most part, offering up some pretty unique moments that set Infinite Warfare apart from its predecessor.Now I know theres a section of Call of Duty fans that abhor the sci-fi angle approach thats creeped into the series up to this point. Unfortunately, youll likely continue to hate that aspect here. Theres full on robots all over the place, interspersed with human enemies. Youll do a bit of mindless hacking on occasion, almost the entire campaign takes place off of Earth, youll fly a spaceship here and there, encounter a few zero-g shootouts, and so on. This is, without exaggeration, the most sci-fi weve seen interjected into the Call of Duty series thus far. But honestly, I kind of love the campaign side for that reason. Theres no half-measure to be found, Infinity Ward isnt hedging bets, and the end result is pretty satisfying overall.Which is what makes the multiplayer so disappointing for me. On one hand (the campaign) youve got some tangible difference between Infinite Warfare and the previous entries. Yeah, Call of Duty has been skating around the concept of space since Ghost, but this is definitely the first time theyve really explored the option of off-world combat so thoroughly. So why oh why is the multiplayer just a repeat of Black Ops 3? And it is just that, a repeat. Yes, you have Rigs now, but they serve the same purpose as Specialist in BLOPS 3. But thats not even the real issue. For me its that the maps dont utilize or make use of anything particularly interesting from the campaign side. Its the same standard set of on-ground maps with numerous corridors, choke points, elevation, and cover. Nothing about the map design or layout feels particularly unique.And while some aspects of obtaining new weapons has changed, its not necessarily for the better. For notable improvements outside of new sights and stocks, youre stuck banking on RNG based crates that require currency earned much too slowly to obtain. And yes, there is a cheaper crate option that you can generally cash in on after a couple of hours playing, but your chances of obtaining something interesting there is lessened due to the rarity system. Overall, its pretty frustrating to see improved weapons locked out due to luck, as opposed to just seeing items like skins tucked behind an in-game crate system. It can be very disappointing to grind out the keys necessary to unlock the rare crate and get stuck with a couple of common emblems and one rare calling card, which seems to happen often.Likewise, the process for earning scrap is also remarkably slow. So while it does give an alternate method of obtaining those special weapon upgrades, its certainly not ideal. All in all, I found the upgrade system to be one of the most disappointing things about the MP side of Infinite Warfare, which is something considering how bland and uninspired the rest of the competitive multiplayer feels.On the plus side, at least the cooperative zombie mode this year is pretty fun. This is Infinity Wards first stab at what has traditionally been a Treyarch joint, but they do a pretty good job for their first swing. The mode is an 80s nostalgia driven thing, taking place in a theme park where youre tasked with turning on the power to access different areas of the park. The key component, blasting away at progressively tougher waves of zombie opponents, is still the big draw here, but exploring the park and finding the various easter eggs is pretty enjoyable. You can match up with 3 other random people online, friends, or play a solo mode as well. Ive never been the worlds biggest zombie mode fan, but I found Infinite Warfares iteration to be pretty good, and Im a sucker for that 80s soundtrack that accompanies it.", "date": "November 14, 2016", "grade": "B-"}
