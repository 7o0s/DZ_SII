{"name": "Townscaper", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/11/townscaper-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "I get why some people are so crazy about Townscaper: its a nice-looking, relaxing game (if you can even call it a game), and we live in distinctly un-relaxing times. I understand that impulse completely.But Id be lying if I said that I found Townscaper even the slightest bit interesting. Its a city-builder of sorts, where you simply build and build and buildand thats literally all there is to it. There are no goals, no time limits, just endless building.In some respects, you could say that this resembles real city-building more than games like Sim City or Cities Skylines  after all, most cities tend to grow organically and chaotically, with only the slightest regard for zoning or buildings and streets being placed properly or any of the concerns you get in more complex city-builders. So if you want to replicate that feeling, youll be able to do that here.But if you want anything more substantive than just building, Townscaper doesnt offer that.That said, my bigger issue with Townscaper is how empty it all feels. Sure, you can build up this huge city on the water, you can create multicoloured neighbourhoods that arent bound by the laws of physics or structural integrity, you can let it grow in whichever direction you want  but it will all feel lifeless, since there arent any people, or even any signs of life. Youll come across park benches, and shrubs, and the odd bird, but thats as close to a living, breathing city as this game comes.Again, if you just want to build, theres nothing wrong with that, and Townscaper will provide you with exactly the kind of non-directed gameplay youre after. But if you want anything of substance, or even just a city-builder that feels like youre creating an actual city, keep on looking, because you wont find that here.", "date": "November 29, 2021", "grade": "C+"}
