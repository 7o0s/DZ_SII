{"name": "Resident Evil Revelations", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/10/resident-evil-revelations-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Who wouldve thought one of the more popular HD ports over the years, was a port of a 3DS game? Since the release of the original Resident Evil revelations, weve been treated to ports on the Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U and now on current gen consoles with a late 2017 release on the Nintendo Switch. So, the question always arises. Is it worth picking up again if you own it already on other consoles.It depends on how much of a fan you were of the game or if you ever played it at all. I thoroughly enjoyed playing RE: Revelations on the 3DS when it was first released five years ago. This was a good reason to be able to play it on my TV so when it came out on PS3, I picked it up, but barely played it.It was a combination of the game being fresh in my mind and the port suffering from some framerate issues. The initial port to home consoles was a benefit for fans that didnt own a 3DS and to that I commend Capcom for releasing it then. Now, in 2017, history is repeating itself and for a similar reason.RE: Revelations was directed by Koshi Nakanishi. This the same person who directed the highly acclaimed Reboot Resident Evil 7 in January this year so it would be a good time for newcomers to the series that enjoyed RE7 to experience his previous game in the series. Granted, the games are opposites in many ways, but the core survival horror aspects are reason enough to check it out.With that said, RE: Revelations is a solid entry in the series and fills the void between RE4 and RE5. The cinematics are the one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb. They show their age and for fans looking for a remaster, this is the only real shortcoming. The game itself looks fantastic on the PS4 and the framerate issues I experience on previous gen consoles is nonexistent.The episodic format was always strange to me, but worked in this case. I felt it was better to have the content available in one release, unlike the sequel that I wont get into. The story isnt exactly memorable, but having veterans Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield be playable helped satisfy the demand for them after the RE5 DLC.The online co-op RAID mode has been updated with a new remixed stage called the Ghost Ship: Chaos. This seems to be the only addition to the game. Other than that, all the previous DLC is available as unlockable rewards.", "date": "October 11, 2017", "grade": "B"}
