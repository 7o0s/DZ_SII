{"name": "The Walking Dead: Episode 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/07/the-walking-dead-episode-2-review-for-xbla-psn-pc/", "text": "If you at all slept on checking out the first episode of Telltales The Walking Dead game, then youre seriously doing yourself a disfavor as the second episode strives to prove. Even if youve not been a big fan of their previous efforts, whether thats from the admittedly lackluster Jurassic Park title, or the entertaining efforts of their Sam and Max, Back to the Future, Wallace and Gromit, and Monkey Island games, Im finding The Walking Dead to be on a whole different level than their previous efforts.And Episode 2 just helps to cement that. Despite some more technical issues which are certainly a slight smear on an otherwise excellent experience, this episode felt like it upped the ante in every meaningful way possible. Having a small cast of characters that weve already been introduced to certainly helps, but the danger in this episode is far more real and intimidating than just wandering hordes of aimless, hungry zombies. The starvation angle is pretty well realized, and the new cast introductions, outside of one lackluster addition that does little here, provides for some pretty jaw dropping moments.Certain elements of this tale do tend to be a little telegraphed for horror enthusiasts, but I almost felt like Telltale figured out that most players would have a rough idea of where things were going to go, and decided to play that up by building a slow tension around the penultimate event that caps off this block of gameplay. And regardless of whether you see the outcome coming from a mile away or not, the journey is still well worth going on, and theres some moments here thatll stand out in your memory long after all the episodes are completed, which is certainly saying something.Its hard to talk about a two to three hour experience without spoiling anything, which Im clearly struggling to do here, but suffice to say the story element of episode 2 is definitely top notch. All the great voice acting, character animation, and overall look of the previous chapter is intact here, so if you were impressed before, youll continue to be so.The gameplay elements are also familiar, featuring a number of scripted events thatll give you different moral quandaries to explore, so that the game will branch off in different paths just like the first chapter. And those choices made in chapter one effect what happens here, and thankfully those choices arent just left by the wayside and are also brought up more than once, making their impact felt in different ways.Besides the various conversational paths, the whole remembering what you said to certain characters is played up again here. Hell, there were things I did in chapter one that impacted the way my cast interacted with Lee that I had kind of forgotten about myself, but Im glad to see that those interactions arent forgotten by the game, no matter how minor they might have been.And of course theres the returning puzzle element, which isnt what Id call The Walking Deads strongest suit. This isnt because theyre particularly hard, or nonsensical, but more so because theyre just a tad too easy and often explain what you need to do before you figure it out yourself. There are a couple instances here that allowed me to explore, but unlike the conversations with their branching paths, most of the puzzle moments only had one real outcome available, which was a tad disappointing to me. One puzzle literally tells me exactly what I need before-hand, which was a bit more revealing than I wanted it to be.", "date": "July 2, 2012", "grade": "A-"}
