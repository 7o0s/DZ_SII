{"name": "Vampyr", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/05/vampyr-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "The most impressive thing about Vampyr on the Switch is that its pretty much the exact same game that came out on PS4/Xbox One/PC back in 2018. Even playing it handheld, you get more or less the same experience (with a minor drawback or two, which Ill get to in a few moments) that you wouldve had on those other consoles. As someone whos craved open-world games on handhelds since back in the PSP days, thats a pretty cool achievement.Unfortunately, while Vampyr on the Switch may offer the same experience as youd get on those other consoles, thats hardly a ringing endorsement. In fact, much of what my colleague Tyler Nethers wrote about the game back in 2018 is equally applicable to the Switch version: its pretty mediocre in almost every way. The story, the characters, the combat  none of it is bad, but none of it is particularly good, either.The general problem with the game still holds: theres nothing particularly memorable here. Because the main character is a vampire and everything takes place at night, everything feels dark, but never in a good or interesting way. Rather, take it more literally  everything here feels dimmed, and its not long before youre wishing for something to break up the monotony.The same goes for the gameplay itself. Even if Vampyr offers an interesting world, it doesnt give you much to do in it. Youre constantly carrying out tasks that lead into the next ones, and it feels like youre basically doing the same things over and over again. Even the combat grows stale pretty quickly; while the first kills feel kind of visceral, theres only so much biting and slashing you can see before it all blends together.Just about the only area where Vampyr on the Switch really differs from its PS4/Xbox versions is in the graphics, and it should come as no surprise that this isnt a good difference. Vampyr features lots and lots of dialogue cutscenes, and they give you an opportunity to see how lousy the characters all look up close. You dont notice it as much the rest of the time  since, again, so much of the game is shrouded in darkness  but when it pauses and you see the people around you closely, it definitely looks like it belongs in the previous generation.Again, if you think about that in the big scheme of things, thats actually kind of impressive. And really, if youre looking for a game on the go thatll last you a few dozen hours (if youre the completionist type), Vampyr delivers that. But that also means spending a few dozen hours with a game thats not particularly interesting, and I dont know why youd want to bother with that.", "date": "May 29, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
