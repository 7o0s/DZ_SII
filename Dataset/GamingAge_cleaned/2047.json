{"name": "Sacred Citadel", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/05/sacred-citadel-review-for-xbla-psn/", "text": "If you are a fan of the Sacred Series, you are probably wondering what would happen if the action RPG elements of the series were removed and you were left with an action side scroller. If you are not a fan, or dont know what the Sacred series is (like myself), then you are probably wondering what Sacred Citadel is and if its worth your time. Im here to answer both questions!Like I said, I have no idea what the Sacred series is, other than its a game. Apparently a third in the series is on its way, and this game seems to bridge a gap between the new release and the previous one. So my play through is based on what is presented and how this game plays on its own, with no connection to previous games in the series. The story is pretty straight forward for this type of game. The land of Ancaria is besieged by Lord Zanes evil Ashen Empire (No relation to YouTube Star Dr. Ashen), The population is enslaved and and uses an orc-like creature called Grimmoc to destroy the protectors of the land. Three warriors are chosen to battle Zanes empire, and the battle for the world begins. Its pretty standard stuff, but it works. Once you select on of the four available classes, you begin in a town that is under attack and spring into action.Sacred Citadel consists of 4 acts, with five areas in each act. Its short, so it doest have much time to get monotonous. Your main goal is to fight your way through all of the enemies blocking your path to the end of the level. All the while picking up better weapons, armor and power ups to help you bring them down faster. You also gain access to new combos as you progress to deal even more damage. After you complete an act, you have a chance to enter a town, where you can stock up on life potions, and power up your weapons, using the gold you acquire from destroying enemies. You will mostly stick to the basic attacks rather than trying to memorize all of the new ones, but its good to have variety. There is also a super meter that fills up as you attack, that, once fully charged, basically unleashes an overpowered attack that can annihilate everything on the screen, including bosses. It takes a long while to power this up, but if you are in danger it comes in handy.Control is a mixed bag, with some of the more complex combos being forgotten in favor of something simpler. Movement can also get a little disorienting, as sometimes you dont know what you can jump on safely or what is just there as part of the background. Its really nothing that takes away from the fun of the battle, but sometimes I took unnecessary damage trying to pull off a move that just didnt work, or jumping into a pit I thought was a safe area. You can also easily miss an attack just by standing to close or being one pixel off, which makes winning against a group of enemies a little tough. It reminded me of classics like Golden Axe and Streets of Rage, where your position is key to surviving a pummeling. While fighting the enemy groups is fun, its the Boss fights that are somewhat uninspired, usually consisting of a more powerful version of an enemy you previously faced. It drags down the gameplay a bit when these guys show up. They start out pretty easy, but in the later levels, youll be screaming in frustration with their cheap hits and insane difficulty.Going at Sacred Citadel alone is fun, but with online co op you have a much better chance of getting through the more difficult levels. The Online works great with no drops outs or lag, but I did have a rather difficult time finding someone to play with. Once I got a few games going online, I discovered that this is a game for more than one person. it can be played solo, but its WAY more fun with partners. Up to three heroes can team up to take on the hordes of Lord Zane, and dominate the game within a couple of hours.Graphics are a nice mix of hand-drawn animation and animated backgrounds that fit well together. Sometimes you see an enemy in the background thinking its just there for decoration, then it runs for the background into the foreground and you are in a fight! There is no slow down even when there is tons happening on the screen, although sometimes it can get hard to see whats going on. Sound is your standard hack and slash fair, with your typical grunts, screams and evil roars of monsters. Music is largely forgettable, but I didnt get the sense that any audio was misplaced. It all sounds and looks decent enough, but its not the visuals or the audio that will draw you in. The pick up and play style is what really shines though.", "date": "May 6, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
