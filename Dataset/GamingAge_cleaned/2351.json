{"name": "I Am Alive", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/03/i-am-alive-review-for-xbla-psn/", "text": "You might think that post-apocalyptic games are a dime a dozen (Gears 3, RAGE, Fallout, etc), but one that takes a grittier, more realistic approach to the de-evolution of modern man is actually quite rare. Think about it; generally speaking, a lot of them dont even take place on earth and almost all of them involve mutants hell-bent on eating you. Dont get me wrong, these games have their place, but at the end of the day they boil down to nothing more than kill all the mutants! Conversely, I Am Alive takes the road less travelled, offering an experienced based on humanitys presumed downward spiral after at cataclysmic event.This premise is something weve seen in literature and film for years, but has yet to properly make its way into videogames. The Event in I Am Alive happened almost a year ago and since then, well, everything has gone to poop. Earth is barely inhabitable with severe dust storms causing a ruckus, food, water and other resources becoming fatally scarce, and there is a general sense of desolation the world over. Not surprisingly, order was the first thing to go out the window and with no policing or military  in other words, no consequences  it didnt take long for civilizations complete regression. And when youre living in such a barren and stressful environment the survival instinct gets kicked into overdrive, primarily, protect whats yours and take what isnt.In I Am Alive the adventure revolves around a protagonist attempting to find his wife and daughter after being stranded on the other side of the country by the Event. As he explains in the opening, 4 hours to fly out east; better part of a year to walk back. Fortunately, he is an avid mountain climber, giving him all the skills necessary for traversing the dilapidated and crumbling urban landscapes. Story is delivered through camcorder clips  like the found-footage movies that are all the rage these days, being viewed by an yet unknown character This leads to the question of whether or not the protagonist made it to his family and keeps things mysterious (in the short-term, anyway).Climbing also makes for an entertaining way to rely less on gunplay (which is the route most often taken by post-apocalyptic mutant games) and more on exploration. Being that its developed by Ubisoft you may be expecting Assassins Creed-style climbing, but that isnt the case. Instead I Am Alive uses a far more realistic approach, dependent on an ever-depleting stamina meter to create a sense of tension and urgency in your movements. And if you strain yourself too much, your auto-replenishing stamina meter reduces in size, requiring items such as food or water to repair the damage. This wouldnt be a problem if these health items werent so few and far between.Another really big gameplay mechanic is its unique take on combat. With resources like ammo and med-kits being as difficult to find as they are, avoiding confrontation is as smart as it is necessary. Theres no point instigating a fight with multiple gang members when youve only got one bullet in the chamber. In order to keep casino online  you on the edge of your seat I Am Alive uses intimidation, threats, and sneak-attacks to minimize the amount of combat you Cette societe offrira des casino jeux de casino, de la loterie et des paris sportifs sur Internet. encounter or to tip the battle in your favor when youre forced to fight. It actually makes for much more intense skirmishes than if you were to just run in and shoot up the place; you never know if things are going to go well or not.At this point youre probably thinking, this game sounds great!and on paper, it does sound great. However, the concepts get overshadowed by the games downright frustrating implementation. Personally, I think it stems from the controls. Its not that theyre completely horrible; its that theyre incredibly stiff compared to what Ive become accustomed to this generation. Maybe Ive gotten spoiled by the fluid controls of games like Uncharted and Assassins Creed, but I Am Alive feels more like last-gen title (looks like it too) Think older Tomb Raider games; not absolutely bad, but rigid... or at least not as dynamic as what Ive come to expect.Worse still is that it affects most aspects of the game. The climbing, for example, is made needlessly more difficult than it should be. Often you find yourself cursing at the screen because you climb in the opposite direction you intended to go. Now even though its simple enough to correct, the problem is your stamina/grip meter is quickly depleting the entire time. It happens quite a bit, too. Similarly, when youre in a stand-off with a group of gang members and youre out of bullets, you have to walk them ever so slowly towards a ledge/pit/fire to kick them off of. So instead of being a really cool bluff mechanic, it just ends up taking forever and sometimes doesnt even end up working properly (instead of kicking them off the ledge/pit/fire, you grapple them, leaving you vulnerable for attack from behind.)As a result of this abrasive implementation, the climbing, stand-offs, and the subdued level of action ultimately end up getting a little stale (actually it gets formulaic, which makes it stale). This is probably why Ubisoft decided to make this game a $15 downloadable instead of trying to artificially lengthen it to a traditional full-size game. Luckily they made I Am Alive short and bitter-sweet at around 5 hours, and then priced it accordingly. Even though the game ends up being slightly lackluster, I still appreciate them getting aggressive with the pricing.", "date": "March 21, 2012", "grade": "C-"}
