While a lot of this is because Major League Baseball has tried its hardest to alienate its fanbase, my intense dislike of MLB The Show 21 certainly didnt help matters. Whereas I sunk hours upon hours into previous versions of the game, the moment I finished reviewing MLB The Show 21, I deleted it and never thought about it again. Even if it was technically a well-made game, between the way it ruined Road to the Show, went all-in on Diamond Dynasty, and took every opportunity to show you ads for microtransactions, I loathed everything about it.MLB The Show 22 isbetter. I wouldnt go so far as to say its amazing, or that its rekindled my passion for baseball (as long as Rob Manfred is still commissioner, thats probably not possible), but its improved enough over last years effort that I can at least say its tolerable.This is largely because theyve largely fixed the problems that plagued last years Road to the Show. No longer do you have to go to a completely separate mode to create your player; now you just get to create him when you start up RTTS. They still want you to spend real money in the marketplace for absolutely absurd add-ons, and they still have the ludicrous loadouts for your players skills, but theyve made it much easier to ignore both of those things.Whats more, MLB The Show 22 also makes it much, much easier to create your two-way player in RTTS. Where before they made you jump through hoops  and even then, made it hard for your player to qualify for both batting and pitching leaderboards  this time, you just get to do it.My feelings towards one of the other notable changes in this years edition is a little more mixed. For the first time in more than a decade, Matt Vasgersian is no longer handling play-by-play duties. As someone whos heard him say the same thing over and over again for literally hundreds of hours, thats undoubtedly a welcome change.Unfortunately, the new play-by-play team isnt exactly an upgrade. Jon Boog Sciambi is much more excitable  and if youre going to put a significant amount of time into the game, thats probably going to become very grating, very quickly. Whats more, he and his partner, Chris Singleton, dont have nearly the same amount of recorded dialogue, which means they start repeating themselves after a very short time.As for the rest of MLB the Show 22, it very much feels like a yearly iteration rather than a massive change. Theres still no single season mode, but both Franchise Mode and March to October are present  and while Ill still lament that the former doesnt allow you to create an expansion team (and no, subbing in one team for another doesnt count), its nonetheless fun that both modes allow you to play around with your rosters.Diamond Dynasty is also still here.As you can probably tell, Im not a fan. Its obviously nowhere near, say, NBA 2K levels of monetization, and theres definitely a step back from last years edition of MLB The Show where seemingly everything was pushing you to play Diamond Dynasty, but even still, I cant even pretend to be interested in it. It feels like theyve beefed up the offline mode, which is nice  but not nice enough to make me give it more than a cursory glance.If it seems like Im being stingy or qualified with my criticismwell, thats because I am. While MLB The Show 22 is definitely a step up from last years game, its pretty clear that the years of the franchise setting the bar for other sports games are behind us. That said, the fixes theyve made after last years soulless debacle are enough that I expect Ill be spending quite a bit of time with this game over the next 12 months or so  which is a pretty big step up from what I was expecting when I started playing it.", "date": "April 6, 2022", "grade": "B"}
