{"name": "Rogue Legacy", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/08/rogue-legacy-review-ps-vita-ps4-ps3/", "text": "I feel like I shouldnt like Rogue Legacy. After all, the two games it most closely resembles  Spelunky and Castlevania  arent games that I like at all. Its pretty hard (usually the last thing I look for in a game), and it makes no concessions towards ever making it any easier on you: not only are the levels all procedurally-generated (which means that each castle is different), you have to give up all your loot before each run, which makes saving up for upgrades extremely difficult, to say the least.And yet: I love it. Im addicted to it. Im having trouble tearing myself away from it to write this review. I dont know that Im ready to call Rogue Legacy my Game of the Year candidate or anything  not with Hotline Miami 2 still on the horizon  but its certainly up there on my list.Honestly, Im having trouble articulating why I love Rogue Legacy so much. If I didnt know any better, though, I might be tempted to say its because, rather than in spite, of all those things I usually hate in games. Take, for example, the soul-crushing difficulty. Usually, I just get discouraged when I die in a level in under a minute. Here, however, the death barely registers; I just momentarily hope that I somehow earned enough coins for some paltry upgrade, and then I launch right into my next life. If thats not the definition of addictive, I dont know what is.To be sure, some of the games better qualities are a little more tangible than that. The writing, for instance, is fantastic; it was always a pleasure to read the short bios of each succeeding generations knights, and finding the little nuggets hidden within (i.e. some knights have coprolalia  that is, the swear excessively  while gay knights are said to be A fan of the man [sidenote: Rogue Legacy may just have more gay and lesbian characters than every other game Ive ever played combined. Progress!]). Likewise, the graphics are cute, and full of fun little flourishes; it may start out looking like your standard retro indie game, but when your knight who cant see in 3D turns around to reveal that (s)he is flat, or when your knight with blurry vision sees everything in his or her immediate vicinity with a big blur around them, its hard not to be charmed.", "date": "August 6, 2014", "grade": "A+"}
