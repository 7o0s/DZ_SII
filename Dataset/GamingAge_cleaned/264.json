Oh yeah pretty much everyone and their grandma! Especially grandmothers since this game is almost 20 years old. Thats like a hundred years in video game time! But enough history because the first in a series of Final Fantasy poets to the Switch has finally arrived and we had a chance to see how it turned out.So if youre familiar with this classic PlayStation game then you might also know it was ported to iOS and PC and then to PS4 not too long ago. Its a sort of HD remaster of the game in its original form with a couple added features that you may or may not have any use for. And now its on the Switch so you can play it on the go!Okay so thats not entirely true, because the original PSOne version of FF9 is available to play on the Vita in all its original glory! More on this in a bit. But what every version has is the thing youre wanting and thats a charming fantasy adventure with memorable characters who I always remember as having voices even though theres no voice at all in the game. I guess that goes to the credit of how much of an impression they left on me back in the day.What you do get here is a higher res looking version of Final Fantasy IX and the perks of the portable/docked Switch hardware. Thats enough for most people to make a decision on where theyll play this game, but those extra features I mentioned might appeal to those looking for ways to cut down on the grind of the original.Just like in the PS4 port you can alter things like the speed of the game, random battle frequency, damage etc. You do this by pressing the start button and reading some very small text on the bottom right to see what options the shoulder buttons will give. For instance if you press R it will run the game at 3x speed. Another option is to toggle attack damage to be 9999 on every hit.While I do welcome these buffs, that all feel like overkill. The speed of 3x feels too fast where maybe 2x or 1.5x would be a better option. For my aging brain the 3x speed in battles actually makes things more difficult. Other options like doing 9999 damage will one-shot enemies and is so overpowered that battles will feel pointless. Now its not like youre trapped with these options being on for the whole game since you can toggle them freely as long as the game isnt loading between an event or battle, but something like a slider or levels of effect would have been very welcome since these options all more or less break the game in your favor. Im more of a fan of how other ports will modify the game by rebalancing XP earned or something. But thats just personal preference and honestly we already knew what we were getting with the options this port would offer.There are some options you can enable like teaching a party member abilities immediately which cant be undone, but the worst youll get out of any of these changes is a lower difficulty for yourself. So modify what you want and enjoy the ride!And theres still a ride to enjoy below these new features, because the original game is still here as represented very faithfully. Well with one exception and thats the UI which is a carryover from the iOS port. I do feel this lessens the charm of the game compared to the original PlayStation text and UI but Square doesnt seem to mind.The other thing I do notice is how the characters dont blend as much into the prerendered backgrounds. This is due to the models having a facelift while the backgrounds look muddy in comparison. I went to compare this for myself against the PlayStation version which I was able to look at on the Vita, and if Im being honest I almost prefer the more pixelated look of the original. The lower tech of the time used a lot of tricks that just dont age well when you only improve one aspect without changing the others. So if youre like me then you might have an initial problem with the visuals feeling half-baked but I found that they actually work better on a TV where it almost had a watercolor look to them.Again these cosmetic complaints dont do anything to the gameplay but I mentioned before versions play on consoles and Vita and for some it may be a more viable option by having a more cozy and charming overall appearance. Its also cheaper!But all that said this is Final Fantasy IX just like you remember and the complaints I have are nit picky. The sound and gameplay both hold up and theres something cool about playing this on a Nintendo console after all the history shared between them and Sony. Its also the same port weve seen with options to speed up the time spent in battles. So if its the first time youre experiencing the game then youre in for a treat and Im glad to see it on the Switch, but at a current price just over $20 for those with other options you may want to wait for a sale.", "date": "February 26, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
