{"name": "Do Not Fall", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/08/do-not-fall-review-for-psn/", "text": "I absolutely loathe Do Not Fall.Thats not to say its the worst game of 2013. Ive definitely played far, far worse: Fuel Overdose was more ineptly made, Bugs vs. Tanks was more insidious, and The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct was just thoroughly terrible. But in terms of games Ive loathed with every fiber of my being, Do Not Fall easily surpasses them all.My reason for hating it is pretty simple: the voice acting is annoying. No, that doesnt do it justicethe voice acting in Do Not Fall feels like a stiletto heel being stabbed into my ears over and over and over. Heres how grating it is: in a former life, I was a music critic, and I once reviewed an album by a lisping rapper that was somehow connected to Insane Clown Posse, but who wasnt good enough to have his album released on their record label. I would rather listen to that on repeat than hear Do Not Falls obnoxious rat creature squeal ReadyGo! ever again.Of course, its only annoying as it is because you have to hear that phrase every time you start or restart a level, and the controls of Do Not Fall are so bad that youll be restarting levels with extraordinary frequency. The games camera is at an awkward angle, which makes it difficult to judge jumps and walk forward which, obviously, is a pretty huge problem for a platformer that consists almost entirely of jumping from one dissolving platform to the next as quickly as you can. Couple that with a very short timer, checkpoints that exist at weird, too-far-apart intervals and level routes that dont make much sense, and the whole thing amounts to an exercise in frustration.Really, though, its the voice acting that makes Do Not Fall truly intolerable. You can try muting it, but then youre left without any sound effects at all, and that just makes the whole experience feel surreal . Similarly, eventually youre allowed to buy a new character, who shouts ReadyGo! in a much, much less annoying voicebut it takes a long time to earn that much currency, and no one should be subject to hearing the games main character shouting for however long it takes them to get to that point.", "date": "August 5, 2013", "grade": "D"}
