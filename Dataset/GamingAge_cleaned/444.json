{"name": "Rainbow Skies", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/08/rainbow-skies-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Rainbow Skies is a solidly above-average JRPG.That, in itself, is nothing to sneeze at. There are far worse ways a game could be described. Ive played a decent number of JRPGs, and a whole lot of them could only dream of being solidly above-average. For Rainbow Skies to achieve that means its better than about 80% of its peers.At the same time, though, its really only worth checking out if youre into the genre. And by that, I mean you need to be into lengthy, exposition-filled dialogue. You need to be into party and inventory management. You really, really need to be into grinding and turn-based battles. Because, as you can imagine, Rainbow Skies has all of those things in spades.Mind you, they all become a lot more tolerable in small doses  which is why its a good thing this game is on the Vita, in addition to PS4 and PS3. In some ways, Rainbow Skies was made to be played on the go. While grinding your way through battle after battle kind of loses its lustre after you reach a certain point, having the flexibility to get a battle in here and there, when youve got a few spare minutes, makes it much easier to digest.And if youre playing it on PS4 or PS3? As I said up top: its solid. As should be abundantly clear by now, Rainbow Skies wont make you rethink everything you think you know about JRPGs or anything, but nor will it make you wonder how anyone could possibly ever enjoy the genre either. Its got an engaging (if somewhat overstuffed) story, combat thats about as straightforward as it gets, and characters who, while generic, never make you cringe in disbelief.Despite all that, saying that Rainbow Skies is for fans of the genre only seems somehow disrespectful. When you say that, it usually implies that youre talking about some obscure, hard-to-love game  which definitely doesnt describe Rainbow Skies. Instead, think of it as a gateway to the genre: if youve ever wanted to play a JRPG but dont know where to begin, Rainbow Skies serves as a pretty thorough intro. (And, of course, if youre already into JRPGs and you need something to sink your next couple of weeks into, itll more than serve that function, too.)", "date": "August 6, 2018", "grade": "B"}
