Thats not inherently a bad thing, of course. Those games were great, and its been the better part of a decade since Nintendo last released a game in the series in North America. Plus, personally, seeing as I loved Sonys attempt at grabbing that market back when Brain Age was a much more recent memory, Im certainly not going to complain about mimicry now.What I will complain about, however, is that Professor Rubiks Brain Fitness is painfully boring and completely devoid of personality. Its one of those games where you can look at the box art (or, at least, the image at the top of the eShop page) and get a pretty good sense of exactly what youre in for. I mean, seriously, go look to that link in the last sentence and look at that picture. It captures this games banality perfectly.The issue may be that the game takes the Rubiks Cube theme a little too much to heart. The colours are all based on the colours from the classic Rubiks Cube; couple that with bland muzak thats constantly wafting over the proceedings, and you feel like youre stuck in some early 80s hell.Likewise, the games are all built around cubes. Ive got to be honest: Id never had a strong feeling about shapes before playing Professor Rubiks Brain Fitness, but afterwards, I came away thinking that cubes might be the most boring shape of all.I mean, its probably not the shapes fault specifically that the games here are all so soporific.It just feels that way when youre counting the cubes on different sides of the line to see which one has more, or comparing equations that are all in cubes, and watching cubes with letters on them flash by the screen as you try and figure out what word is being spelled out, anduhrightsorry, I drifted off for a second there. Theres also a Cube 2048, and cube-whatever else. Honestly, even if there are something like a dozen-plus different minigames that test your math, spatial reasoning, and linguistic skills, they all look so similar that they still all feel the same.In theory, Professor Rubiks Brain Fitness gives you all these games so that you can practice your skills and improve on its tests, but its not like the tests are any better. I constantly found my attention drifting as I tried focusing on where a specific square landed when a cube exploded, or guiding one cube towards another cube on a path across other cubes. Cubes, cubes, and more cubes, and at no time does the game threaten to become interesting.Maybe theres a reason why Nintendo has seemingly abandoned brain training games. Maybe this sort of thing now works better on a smartphone. Maybe Professor Rubiks Brain Fitness is just a bad example of a totally viable genre. You can pick your argument, and youd probably be right. Just about the only thing Im sure of after playing this game is that Im ready for a good, long nap.", "date": "January 21, 2021", "grade": "C"}
