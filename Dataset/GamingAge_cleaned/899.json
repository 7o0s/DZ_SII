{"name": "Supermagical", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/02/supermagical-review-ps-vita/", "text": "If youve ever played one of the many, many bubble-popping/matching games that exist on pretty much every platform and device of the last, say, twenty years, youll have a pretty good idea of whats in store for you with Supermagical. There are little demons that come in various colours, you have to fire matching colours at them to make them go away, and you repeat that until youve cleared the board. If you somehow havent played a similar gamewell, all you really need to do is read the previous sentence. Complicated, its not.Because Supermagical sticks to such a well-worn path, theres not much to say about it. The game generally meets a basic level of competency, so there are no concerns about whether its playable. It adds a story about a magical being trying to rein in her sisters, which I suppose puts it one step above most other Bust-a-Move clones, but its not like one of these games lives or dies by its plot. Likewise, having a world map is an interesting addition to the genre, but by no means a make-or-break one.There are some minor issues, to be sure. The controls are a little finicky, whether you use touch controls or the thumbstick/button combo; neither, unfortunately, allows you to be as precise as the game sometimes demands. Generally this isnt a big deal, but in the puzzle levels, you may find yourself cursing the game.", "date": "February 28, 2017", "grade": "B"}
