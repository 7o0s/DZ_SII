I mean, its right there in the genres name; if a game fails at either of those facets, theres really not much else to say about it.And, hey, what do you know: The Dreamlands: Aislings Quest is pretty bad at both pointing and clicking.To be sure, there are other things at which Aislings Quest doesnt exactly excel. Most obviously, its pretty ugly, with graphics that look like they were lifted straight out of a mid-tier PS2 game. Theres also a story thats not nearly enough to sustain a players interest over the course of a game  which is particularly bad when you consider that the whole thing can easily be beaten in under an hour.But at its core, Aislings Quest fails because it makes it difficult for players to perform the most basic of tasks. It doesnt explain anything, forcing you to touch blindly around the screen, hoping to trigger something new. On top of that, even when you touch the right spot, it doesnt always respond, usually taking several taps before anything happens. It wasnt uncommon for me to have to click something, click back out of the scene, and then click back in with the hopes that a second or third try would be the one that finally worked.The worst part of the previous paragraph is that youd think that the Vitas touchscreen would actually lend itself to point-and-click adventure. After all, it works for every other adventure game Ive played on the system. Yet, for whatever reason, Aislings Quest is finicky, which makes it impossible to enjoy the game.Unsurprisingly, theres a direct correlation between game not working properly and me not liking it. I can overlook outdated graphics, and I can overlook a mediocre plot. But when a game just doesnt function  and make no mistake, The Dreamlands: Aislings Quest doesnt  thats simply unforgivable.", "date": "October 16, 2018", "grade": "D"}
