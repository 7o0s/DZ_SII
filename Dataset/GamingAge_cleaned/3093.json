Its incredibly generic, and it doesnt do anything particularly well  but, at the same time, theres nothing really bad about it, either, which is a pretty remarkable achievement when you consider where its coming from.See, its the most recent RPG from Spiders, whose track record isnot great, to put it mildly. They were behind The Technomancer (which was terrible), and Bound By Flame (which may have been worse), and Mars: War Logs (which was, again, not very good). By those low standards, being half-decent is actually not too bad.I know that Im damning GreedFall with faint praise, but half-decent, not too bad is basically exactly where the game lies. The graphics arent going to blow you away. The dialogue is incredibly heavy on the exposition. The characters are all entirely forgettable. The setting is mostly like every other quasi-medieval RPG youve ever played before (except maybe fast-forward to an age that allowed for guns). But theres nothing here thats outright awful, which, given that previous games from the same developer never even achieved that minor level of success, constitutes a monumental achievement.In fact, if you just go with it and dont expect too much out of GreedFall, you may even have a little fun. Even if this isnt quite an open world, the map here is still pretty sizeable, and youll find plenty to do as you set out to colonize a newly-discovered land. There are lots of side quests on top of the main story, and the game gives plenty of opportunity to explore and do things at your own pace.I also enjoyed the combat much more than I wouldve expected. Adding in guns is kind of a cheat, since those tend to beat swords pretty easily. Nonetheless, when you find yourself battling a big boss, its nice to have the option to pull out your pistol, rather than endlessly hacking away with a sword and/or firing magic balls at your enemy.I even appreciated how the story makes use of the fact that your character is a diplomat by giving you fairly free rein to conduct diplomacy between the many groups that populate GreedFalls world. I wouldnt say that the diplomacy that nuanced, but it still gives the game more depth than I would have expected going in.", "date": "January 21, 2020", "grade": "B"}
