I mean, its basically the same game, so if the developers didnt go to the trouble of doing anything new, its not like theres anything new to say about it, right?Okay, that may be a little harsh. There are some minor changes here and there. Reed 2, for example, features 52 levels, compared to the 50 that were in the original Reed game. AlsouhI dont know, the lights seem to flicker less in this game, which makes it easier to see things?Seriously, calling Reed 2 a sequel to Reed Remastered seems like an abuse of the term. You could just as easily call it The Lost Levels, and that wouldve at least been accurate. It looks the same, it plays the same, it does pretty much everything the same.Mind you, if youre in the mood for some tough-as-nails platforming, thats not the worst thing in the world. Reed Remastered was a solidly unspectacular example of the genre, and Reed 2 is as well. In fact, it may be a little harder (theres another difference!).", "date": "August 31, 2020", "grade": "C+"}
