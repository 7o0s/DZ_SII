{"name": "Big Pharma", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/03/big-pharma-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Im going to admit something right off the bat when it comes to Big Pharma: I did not get very far into it, at least in terms of playing through its dozens of challenges and scenarios. On the one hand, this means you should take everything else I have to say about the game with a massive grain of salt  I was able to go far as a gameplay video took me, and then I had very little idea what to do next and spent the rest of my time with the game flailing about.On the other hand, I feel like my experience speaks to what its like to play Big Pharma on the Switch if you have no prior experience with the game. Its not just unfriendly towards new players, it seems actively hostile. It may have been well-liked by certain corners of the PC universe back when it first came out there in 2015, but its really hard to see what the fuss was about if youre playing on a Switch.Some of the problems come down to absolutely terrible user interface design choices. It should come as no surprise that the game asks you to do quite a bit of reading  its a business management sim, after all. For some reason, however, Big Pharma decided to use a ridiculously tiny font, which means that youll be squinting at screen after screen of text if you want to know what to do next.On top of that, they decided to layer screens on top of each other, so you have to quit in and out of different screens to do what Big Pharma asks of you. Im not averse to figuring out how to play a game, but when the very first tutorial screen is layered on top of another screen youve got to be able to read in order to know what youre doing, it speaks to a certain indifference on the part of a game to helping newcomers get their feet.The content of those tutorials isnt much more helpful either. It feels like the person who wrote the tutorial didnt pay any attention to whats happening on screen, and the end result would be funny if it werent so frustrating. Right off the bat, for example, the game tells you to move your cursor over a certain bar. However, it never tells you how to gain control of a cursor that can be moved over any bar. (I ended up giving up and guessing what to do next based on what was being shown in the pictures.)These little disconnects persist. The game tells you to buy a vaporizer to start production, but theres no vaporizer to purchase. There is, however, an evaporator, which seems to be what the game calls a vaporizer. Similarly, the game tells you to select a markers tab, which is actually a typo for the makers tab. Elsewhere, the game tells you to buy 3 vaporizers/evaporators, when you actually need to buy 4 of them. At one point the tutorial tells you to name a drug, only, as far as I could tell, you cant do that in the console version of Big Pharma. Individually, none of these things are dealbreakers, but together they suggest a certain indifference  if not outright hostility  to newcomers to the game.These gripes aside, theres one part of the game that more or less works like its supposed to on the Switch: the puzzle aspect. You have to lay out your drug-making machinery on a factory floor, so you need to give real thought to how youre going to place them and connect them so that ingredients flow in and pills flow out. Its not really the core part of the game  that would be the research and pricing and all the other management-y things that are a pain to carry out with a controller  but its the one part thats intuitive enough on the Switch that not even lousy porting can get in the way.Its a pity the same cant be said for the rest of Big Pharma. I have no doubt that, in the right circumstances, it could be a lot of fun to play. Those right circumstances, however, are clearly on a PC. The Switch version of this game was thrown together with no attention or care as to whether things work, and unless youre well-acquainted with the game going in, youre not going to get very much out of it.", "date": "March 4, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
