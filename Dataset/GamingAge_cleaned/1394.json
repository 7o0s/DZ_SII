{"name": "Broken Age", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/07/broken-age-review-for-ps4-ps-vita/", "text": "Im glad, in a way, that Grim Fandango and Broken Age came to the Vita (and PS4) just a few months apart. After all, until the latter game came out, the former represented Tim Schafers last foray into adventure games  a genre over which he looms large, having created not only Grim Fandango, but also having served as one of the principal players behind the Monkey Island series. And since a) Ive never before played any of Schafers games, and b) Im not really into adventure games outside of the odd hidden object game (assuming those count), the proximity of the games release dates meant I could basically see twenty years of the genres evolution in the span of just a few months.My conclusion: its improved significantly. Or, at least, its gotten significantly easier. (Ill admit, the two are often intertwined for me.)While the first conclusion is obviously debatable, I dont think there would be much argument over the second. After all, its justI dont know, easier, for lack of a more accurate descriptor. Theres a lot less guesswork involved. You dont spend anywhere near the same amount of time walking around random places, trying to interact with every single thing you come across and hoping youre figuring everything out in the correct order. Whereas in Grim Fandango you had to slowly feel your way through every step as you puzzled it out, in Broken Age you get a cursor that changes shape when it hovers over something you can use.Not only that, it feels like the dialogue is much more streamlined. In Grim Fandango you could spend a lot of time getting involved in circular conversations. In Broken Age they all flow naturally  or, at least, as natural as branching dialogue trees can go. Your questions get answered, and then you move on to the next phase of the conversation; theres no sarcastic responses as you ask the same questions over and over again. (I recognize that this may represent a loss for some people, particularly if they cut their teeth on 90s-style humor.)While those improvements may be seen as contentious by some people, I doubt that anyone would debate that the graphics here are significantly better. After all, it doesnt matter what game were talking about, if its more than fifteen years old its going to show its age. Broken Age, by contrast, feels bright and modern  as it should, since the main characters are young, optimistic kids, not travel agents for the dead. To some extent, I guess, it lacks the distinctive visual identity that a game like Grim Fandango possessed, but if thats the standard were going by, I dont think its one that many games would manage to clear.", "date": "July 10, 2015", "grade": "A"}
