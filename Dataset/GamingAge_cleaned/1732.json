On the one hand, Im kind of just glad it exists. Id be the last person on Earth to complain about the Vita not having enough games, but it really doesnt seem like SCEA has paid all that much attention to their fledgling handheld. Just the fact theyre putting out anything at all seems like a minor miracle.Yet at the same time  and I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth here  we are talking about a port of a port. Considering that the Vitas predecessor, the PSP, got not one but two very good original God of War games in Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta, this does have the faint air of leftover scraps. I mean, I get why they wouldnt want to invest in a system that (lets be honest) isnt exactly setting North America on fire, sales-wise, but at the same time, a little bit more effort would be nice.Particularly since those aforementioned PSP games are both available on the Vita  and, whats more, both are arguably better than God of War I and II. Sure, you dont get trophies, but in every other respect, Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta are probably more worthy of your time and money. Thanks to the wonders of bilinear filtering, they look at least as good (particularly during cutscenes), and the action in both of those games seems much better suited to the smaller screen.On a completely different note, perhaps the most interest aspect of having the Collection on the Vita is seeing what was changed in order to make the games work. For instance, the Quick Time Events: maybe my memory of the first two GoW games is off, but they seem a lot easier here than they ever did before. Whereas some of them used to drag on forever, here theyre over and done with after just a few inputs. While some people might miss those (I know Ive always had a soft spot for them), I suspect many more people will be glad theyre gone, especially since theres no vibrating controllers giving you feedback here.On a less positive note, the Vita versions occasionally seem to require a level of finesse and precision that I dont think has ever been associated with any of the other games in the series. I suppose that adds a new dimension, but at the same time, its a little frustrating to cross the same bridge over and over again just because a slight misstep sends you flying over the side. Similarly, in order to get around the lack of R2/L2 buttons, the Vita versions utilizes the rear touch pad. While that was probably a necessity, it doesnt make it any less annoying when you accidentally try to open a chest right in the middle of a fight.Thats not to say that the God of War Collection on Vita is completely without its charms. The two games are considered classics for a reason, and even if they may not look or play as nice on the Vita as they do elsewhere, theyre still pretty outstanding. Last years blandly forgettable God of War: Ascension may make it easy to forget, but at its best (i.e. everything other than Ascension), the games in this series are some of the finest, most epic action games youre ever likely to play. Fights against gods and titans like Ares, Zeus and Kronos might not have quite the same sense of grandeur here that that do when youre up against them on a larger screen, but theyre all pretty cool nonetheless.", "date": "May 6, 2014", "grade": "B"}
