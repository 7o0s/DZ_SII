{"name": "Ring Run Circus", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/11/ring-run-circus-review-ps-vita/", "text": "It shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone that Ring Run Circus got its start as a mobile game. After all, it hits nearly all the major boxes youd usually associate with that branch of gaming. Simple controls? Check. So-so graphics? Check. Short levels? Check again. About the only way it could be any more iOS would be if it somehow worked In-App Purchases in, but thankfully those were left out.Im sorry  that probably comes off way meaner than I intended. I dont dislike Ring Run Circus by any stretch of the imagination. Its justIm not crazy about it, either.Which is actually kind of surprising to me, since it starts off with such promise. The game is described by the developers as a ring-former, and at first it seems like something genuinely new and fresh. Youre controlling acrobats who go around and around rings endlessly, and its up to you to navigate them around obstacles to a key that has to be inserted in a keyhole. While the descriptor of ring-former may hint at a platforming element that isnt really present in Ring Run Circus, it still manages to combine two genres  endless running and puzzle  that you wouldnt think go together, but do, and surprisingly well to boot.The problem comes from the fact that beyond that initial innovation, Ring Run Circus doesnt seem to do a whole lot more. It shows you all it can do pretty much right off the bat, and thenthats it. Even though the game tries to mix things up a little with different characters who have different special moves, and with rings that move around, its hard to get over the feeling that youre just stuck in an endless cycle of doing the same thing over and over again. Its fun for a couple of levels, but not for the 50+ that Ring Run Circus offers.Thats unfortunate, since Id really like to enjoy Ring Run Circus more than I do. On top of having an interesting mechanic, its also pretty charming to look at. Not visually dazzling or anything (hence why I said it had so-so graphics), but it still has a cute little aesthetic that it sticks to throughout.", "date": "November 18, 2014", "grade": "B-"}
