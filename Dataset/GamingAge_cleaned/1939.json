This entry once again features Sam Fisher as the protagonist, now heading up Fourth Echelon, and follows up from the events found in the last entry, Conviction. While the earlier reveals of Blacklist seemed to give some indication that this would be a more action focused title like its predecessor, I was happily surprised to find that stealth and covert action was alive and well here.Certain mechanics from Conviction do make the cut here, like the improved cover system that allows Sam to easily stick to cover and move between nearby objects in the environment without being spotted. Enemy detection is also very similar, with a lot of focus given to staying within the shadows while sneaking about, something the series is certainly well known for. Theres some visual aid given to the player to help determine how well hidden you are, by highlighting the small lights on Sams outfit, which shine brightly when covered in shadow. Overall, environment traversal feels great here, with Sam given a wide range of mobility options to cover a lot of ground without being detected.Enemy A.I. also seems a little improved, if not a tad bit unpredictable. You can be spotted from a distance, but are generally given enough time to dash behind cover. Theres an on-screen detection meter that pops up when an enemy begins to notice you, again something thats not unlike what we saw in Conviction. If you stay in sight too long, youll officially be spotted, forcing you to hide and avoid enemies on alert. But where Conviction gave Sam the option of winning most encounters by firefight, youll find that Sam feels a bit more fragile here. Theres still opportunity to engage in full on assaults, but its honestly the toughest way to get through the game.The campaign portion of Blacklist has Sam and his team traversing the world attempting to thwart a terrorist group called the Engineers. The Engineers up front goal is to see the United States remove all soldiers from foreign lands, and in order to make that happen, have implemented The Blacklist. This is a series of scheduled events that involve high value targets meant to cripple the infrastructure of America, and its up to the newly formed Fourth Echelon to stop them. Youll travel across a variety of locales throughout the campaign, and while the visuals arent necessarily breathtaking, at least theres more attention to the color palette than Conviction featured.Id really like to praise the overall design for the majority of the campaign missions. Theres a scoring system in place that tracks points for different activities, like evading or taking down enemies. These points are divided into three categories, Ghost, Panther and Assault. Essentially these are different play styles, awarding you points depending on how you opt to tackle any given mission. And all three are completely viable for every stage, with a lot of optional routes, a fair number of secret paths, and a lot of gadgets/weapons at your disposal to aid you along the way. Theres some added replay value given too, since getting the maximum points in any given style will take a lot of effort. And then there are the optional goals, which include bagging high value targets for extraction, securing data from laptops, and picking up well hidden dead drops.Completing missions will earn Sam and his team cash, which in turn is used to better outfit Sam in new gear. Theres a variety of suit options, broken down into sub-categories like boots, gloves and so on. Theres different gear for different styles of play, with stats boosted in categories like gun handling and stealth. Youll also eventually gain access to additional slots for loadouts, so you can diversify Sams abilities, weapons, and gadgets even further. Along with personal upgrades and gear for Sam, you can opt to spend money on your mobile base, a modified cargo plane dubbed Paladin. Upgrades found here can improve your ability to see optional items via radar on missions, or give you access to black market weaponry. Cash is given out at a moderate pace, with better scores on missions netting more money, but unless youre grinding out missions for money youll never feel like youve got more cash than items to spend it on.Outside of the fun and engaging campaign, Blacklist offers up a series of co-op missions and the return of Spies vs. Mercs multiplayer. The co-op missions are lightly tied into campaign, and can be tackled in between story missions if you choose. Co-op missions are completely optional though, and can even be completed solo. However, with a partner in tow, youll certainly be more successful. You can also unlock optional routes when partnered up with someone that are otherwise inaccessible when playing alone. Matchmaking is pretty straightforward, and I had little trouble finding random folks to play with on PSN with our PS3 review copy.Spies vs. Mercs is also pretty well implemented here. My only real complaint with multiplayer is that you need to load into the campaign hub on Paladin to access it, instead of being able to choose it from the start screen like most titles. Spies vs. Mercs employs a lot of modern day multiplayer mechanics, like gained experience for completing matches and a leveling up system tied into that. Youll also be able to modify loadouts for both classes, using cash earned in both multiplayer and single player modes.Youre limited to two initial playlists, a beginner list that pairs you up with other low level players in 4 vs. 4 maps. Theres also an option for classic Spies vs. Mercs, which are 2 on 2 affairs with classic shadow mechanics from earlier Splinter Cell entries like Chaos Theory. Eventually youll gain access to standard 4 vs. 4 maps regardless of player level, along with mixed team matches and standard team deathmatch as well.If youve never played Spies vs. Mercs in previous Splinter Cell titles, youll certainly enjoy this mode. And if you already know what youre getting into here, youll find that what youve loved about Splinter Cells unique multiplayer fun is largely unchanged. The additional modes are fun to check out, but the real charm is in the classic 2 vs. 2 maps. With a communicative partner tagging along, you can really wreak havoc on the sanity of an opposing team, which can be a whole lot of fun.", "date": "September 5, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
