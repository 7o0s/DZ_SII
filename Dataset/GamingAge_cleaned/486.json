{"name": "7scarlet", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/06/7scarlet-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Of all the visual novels Ive played, I have to say that 7scarlet may just be the one that lives up to the novel part of the genre name the most. I dont just mean that it provides endless amounts of exposition  though, like most other games of this type, it certainly does that. Rather, I mean that 7scarlet is the one that feels most structured like a proper novel. Where most otome novels seem to follow a pretty specific formula  you meet the heroine, and moments later, you basically meet every one of her potential love interests all at once  7scarlet takes its time introducing its cast of characters. The story is given room to breathe, and the various suitors are introduced relatively naturally, instead of the plot contriving some reason for half a dozen or so unconnected men to be in the same room at the same time.I should note, of course, that just because the suitors are introduced in a slightly different way, it doesnt mean that theyre anything other than the usual stereotypes that populate the genre. Theyre all floppy-haired and slightly feminine. They all have a passionate interest in everything the heroine does, even if she doesnt seem all that interesting. They hit the archetypal bases of the nerdy one, the friendly one, the cold one, and so forth. 7scarlet is different, but its not that different, you know?Still, 7scarlet is a mystery novel, and by meting out its mystery slowly, rather than all at once, the game does a pretty good job of building the tension. Half the time when I play these sorts of games, Ill hit a point where I inevitably have to stop myself from fast-forwarding the dialogue, because so much of it just seems like its repeating the same plot points over and over. Here, by building things up gradually, you cant help but get sucked into its story.I also have to say that 7scarlet looks a lot nicer than many of its contemporaries, at least in places. Most of it is just your standard talking heads zooming on and off the screen, but there are places here and there where the game decides to show off the environment. I wouldnt say that the graphics are incredible or anything, but they still do a nice job of establishing a sense of place when they show a train chugging through the countryside, or a babbling brook. Other games would be well-advised to follow this lead, rather than just allowing the dialogue to be everything.To be sure, the usual caveat still applies: 7scarlet is by Otomate, which means that you need to go in expecting the story to take more than a few seemingly unnecessary romantic detours. But, like Bad Apple Wars and Psychedelia of the Black Butterfly before it, has a decent story underneath all that romance, and if youre willing to give it abit of a chance, it definitely pays off.", "date": "June 29, 2018", "grade": "B+"}
