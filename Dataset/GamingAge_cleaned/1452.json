{"name": "Titan Souls", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/04/titan-souls-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "The first thing you discover about Titan Souls is that it doesnt pussyfoot around. One second youre learning how to run, the next youre learning how to shoot your arrow, and the third second in (give or take a few moments, depending on how quickly youre moving) youve arrived at the games first boss fight. At which point youll most likely die.And die again. And again. And again. And again and again and again.Its possible, of course, that you wont die immediately. If youre both an incredibly fast learner and have a fair amount of luck on your side, you may not end your first moments with the game being absorbed by giant, bouncing balls of goo. You might just somehow instantly figure out how to beat that boss, and emerge victorious.Except then youre on to the giant stone eyeball, and youll have to do it all over again. Or youre on to the brain in an icecube. Or the sentient building with giant hands. Or thewell, you probably get the idea. The bottom line is, this game is constantly trying to kill you. Which, really, makes sense, since Titan Souls is literally nothing but boss fights, and if video game bosses cant kill you, what will?Of course, how much you enjoy all those boss fights depends entirely on how hard you want your games to be. Because make no mistake: Titan Souls is insanely hard. Theres no gradual slope upwards here as far as difficulty goes; youre tossed into the deep end instantly, and it just keeps harder and harder from there. Youre armed only with a single arrow, which you have to retrieve after every shot. Each boss has different weak points, and none of them move in any obvious patterns. And, to top it all off, every boss kills you with a single hit, at which point youre instantly sent back to the checkpoint, which means theres no grinding your way through a level and using attrition as a strategy  you either kill the boss or you dont.It should come as no surprise, of course, that aesthetically Titan Souls borrows quite a bit from the 80s. The top-down, blocky graphics are reminiscent of the Legend of Zelda games, while the simple melody harkens back to the earlier days of gaming, too. Couple that with the simple controls (one button to run, one button to launch your arrow), and you can see how this game feels like it couldve been a missing gem from the NES.", "date": "April 21, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
