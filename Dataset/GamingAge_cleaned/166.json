{"name": "Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/06/persona-5-dancing-in-starlight-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "I purposely gave myself a couple of months between playing Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight and Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight because I didnt want the two games to run together in my mind, or to judge the latter based on my opinion of the former.Turns out, that didnt matter much, since even with those months separating the two games, they still seem almost indistinguishable to me,I mean, yes, there are some minor differences. Whereas P3D featured the SEES being taken to the mysterious Velvet Room, in P5D its Joker and the Phantom Thieves. Likewise, the music differs, with the soundtracks for each song being taken from their respective games. And, uhHonestly, thats about it. There are storylines of sorts in both, but theyre essentially identical, with the cast of characters from each game simply being swapped out for each other. The games look the same, too, so unless youre already familiar with the characters, theyll all seem kind of interchangeable to you. The gameplay is exactly the same, as youd expect, with all the same controls, and visuals, and cues, and, well, everything.This isnt terrible, to be sure. Just like P3D was fun even for people like me who arent intimately familiar with the series, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight offers a pretty solid rhythm game experience, with a good mixture of funky beats and engaging character interactions.But as far as standing on its own two feetit doesnt. Or, I guess, it does if youve never played P3D, in which case Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight will seem relatively fresh and original. But unless youre a diehard Persona completist, I just cant see why anyone would need to play both. Theyre more or less the same game, and even if that game is fine for what it is, you really only need to play one or the other.", "date": "June 6, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
