Spacejacked is set on a spaceship that youre defending from alien invaders, and its up to your character to set up guns in every room defending the cores. The arcade influence comes in from the fact that your character (Dave, for the record) is running around the room, upgrading the guns, collecting metal (which is necessary for upgrading your weapons and repairing each rooms core), and shooting at the aliens yourself.That may not sound like a huge tweak to the formula, but in practice, it makes everything feel much more immediate. Sure, the action in your usual tower defense games can get a little heated at times, but it still feels like its all happening at a remove because of the fact youre watching the action unfold on a map. By putting your character right in the middle of the action, it all feels a little more immediate.(And thats without even factoring in that Dave cant jump. Instead, he switches gravity, so that he simply flips down to the other side of the platform. It feels kind of awkward at first, but it doesnt take long before it, too, seems like a fun change of pace from the usual.)I dont want to overpromise what Spacejacked has in store. Ultimately, its kind of a short game (around 20 levels or so, and it can be beaten in under 3 hours) that doesnt do anything that revolutionary. But even so, it offers a nice tweak on the tower defense formula that will get your blood pumping. If youre a fan of tower defense games, what more do you need?", "date": "January 18, 2019", "grade": "B"}
