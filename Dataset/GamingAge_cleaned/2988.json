After all, Ive played more than my fair share of KEMCO games over the years, so I figured this would be more of the same : a fairly generic JRPG that draws heavily from the early days of the genre, with the same artwork and the same systems and the sameeverything, really, that youd see in all their other games.And to some extent, this is true. Outside of the battle scenes, I think Illusion of LPhalcia is probably interchangeable with, like, 90% (if not more) of the same assets as all those other KEMCO games. While the game makes a big deal about customizing your characters with runes, even the battles are your standard turn-based deal. Likewise, theres the odd bit of voice acting here, but for the most part, the dialogues are the usual back and forth with characters sliding on and off the screen.There are a couple of ways in which Illusion of LPhalcia differs, however, and none of them are good. For one thing, this game is a lot wordier than most other KEMCO games. Dialogue scenes drag on forever, routinely running 10+ minutes, and theres no option that I could see to make it automatic  which means that youre scrolling through line after line of text.Not only that, the dialogue is painfully boring. Even if most KEMCO games look generic, theyre often surprisingly off-beat. No such luck here. Once you get past the fact that the main characters best friend is a talking leopard, everything here is by the book. The dialogue plods along, and basically exists only to dump massive amounts of exposition on you. Whats more, very little of it seems to matter, considering were talking about a pretty standard plot involving princesses, kingdoms, a jerky main character, and a legendary sword.Illusion of LPhalcia also makes tentative steps into the world of 3D animation. Its not the first time KEMCO games have tried 3D, but they dont do it often, and it looks absolutely awful here. Some excuses could be made for the fact this is actually a port of one of their older gamesbut still, were talking about a game that was originally released in 2014, not 1994. Theres no reason why the few scenes with 3D characters should look as bad as they do.To be fair, if it werent for those shoddy 3D animations, there wouldnt be a single thing in Illusion of LPhalcia thats even remotely memorable. Its near the bottom of the barrel as far as KEMCO JRPGs go, and youd be better off playing pretty much anything else theyve brought over to consoles.", "date": "May 7, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
