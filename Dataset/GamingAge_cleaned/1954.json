{"name": "Mars: War Logs", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/08/mars-war-logs-review-psn-xbla-pc/", "text": "Is Mars: War Logs a good game? By pretty much any objective measure, the answer is probably no. In fact, to be completely honest, its kind of terrible. This is clear from the very first shot of the game, when you see a bunch of identical-looking NPCs sitting in the back of a truck, and theyre all moving in sync. If that doesnt clue you in right from the get-go that youre not exactly in for a slick, AAA experience, then maybe youll notice it whenheck, I dont even know where to begin, this games list of sins is so long.Just off the top of my head:Basically, there are plenty of reasons why Mars: War Logs isnt a good game. All that said, however, if you change the question from Is Mars: War Logs any good? to Is Mars: War Logs worth playing?, the answer suddenly becomes a little more complicated.Now, I should admit here that I have a bit of a thing for bad games  and by a bit, I mean that in the last year or so, Ive actively sought out and played games like Men in Black: Alien Crisis, Fast and Furious: Showdown, Aliens: Colonial Marines and The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct. In other words, I find joy in playing games that are complete and utter garbage. So you might want to take what I say next with a grain of salt: I had a blast playing Mars: War Logs.Again, its not a very good game. But that doesnt mean I wasnt able to revel in its cheesy, poorly-made awfulness. At root, I think this is because Mars: War Logs differs from all those other games I just mentioned in a fundamental way: its not some cheap cash-in designed to generate money from name alone. It seems like the team behind it had a story they actually wanted to tell, and even if their execution of that story turned out to be (far, far, far) less-than-perfect, its hard to deny that a fair amount of love and care went into the game.", "date": "August 23, 2013", "grade": "C+"}
