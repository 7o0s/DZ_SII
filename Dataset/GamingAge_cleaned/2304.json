While the core concept remains relatively untouched, which involves smashing LEGO objects to collect studs, building objects to figure out puzzles, and navigating a fairly large hub (a concept introduced in the Harry Potter titles), all of these aspects just feel a whole lot bigger this time out.Take the hub world, for instance. LEGO Batman 2 doesnt just give you an expanded version of the Batcave to toy around in, instead you get the entirety of Gotham City, complete with tall buildings, hidden objectives, citizens in peril, and a whole host of vehicles to navigate the city streets with. Its a slight nod to other, more popular open world titles usually reserved for more adult styled video games like Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row. And while theres certainly a bit more ground to explore than there is stuff to do, you can definitely have a bit of your own fun with it all if youre willing to.The addition of new superheroes also adds a brand new element, and besides Batman and Robin, youll gain access to guys like Superman, Green Lantern, and so on. Superman in particular is a blast to toy around with, and comes complete with flight, heat vision, and cold breath. Besides just using him to solve puzzles in the individual levels, flying around Gotham and making a mess of things with Supes is a pretty entertaining diversion, and his powers scale nicely to the LEGO infused settings.The actual stages, which contain much of the gameplay here, also seem to be expanded upon in design. Theres a lot of thought that went into the puzzles, outside of just hitting switches and levers, and theres a literal plethora of skills, devices, and suits at your disposal for different reasons. In the first few stages alone youll gain access to more suits than I ever remember being present in the first LEGO Batman game.And the selection of villains here is pretty vast. With the addition of more superheroes, comes a cast of bad guys thats culled from various corners of the DC Universe. So while the game starts off with the more classic Batman villains like Two-Face, Joker, Riddler, and Catwoman, youll soon face off against guys from both the Flash and Green Lanterns rogues gallery, along with a number of other side characters that flesh out the story.In regards to the story, this is also the first Travelers Tales LEGO title to feature fully voiced work for every character. While theres still a certain level of emoting and grunting LEGO sounds that occur, most of the in-between level cutscenes involve fully voiced characters interacting, which does take a little getting used to. I imagine this helps rectify the problem in not retelling a tale taken from a film like previous games, and just helps sell the plot for interested parties. As far as actual story goes, its not necessarily mind-blowing, but is definitely fun and has a few laugh out loud moments scattered about. Again, its kid friendly, but not without a few subtle winks for the adults that enjoy the games as well.Also worth noting is that I found this to be a visually impressive game from the team over at Travelers Tales. The last Harry Potter title looked pretty good, but theres certainly a higher level of polish that went into pulling off Gotham City in LEGO form, and it doesnt lose any of its gothic architecture even when broken down into the familiar blocks. Texture work for various structures looks exceptionally nice here, and Im glad to see the use of some more real-world looking foliage scattered about to help sell the environment better than just LEGO could. Its an interesting mix of real objects and LEGO blocks that look better than any of the previous LEGO titles have for me.Also, the soundtrack is appropriately epic, using both familiar themes from Batman and Superman films. Sometimes theyre used for comedic effect, sure, but hearing that slow crescendo build during the opening title sequence really helps set the mood for any kind of Batman adventure, and LEGO Batman 2 doesnt miss a beat here.As usual, co-op is still the best way to play the game, and the standard local drop-in / drop-out co-op mode is present here. Again, no online play sadly, but Im hoping that this is something Travelers Tales starts shooting for, at least for the next console cycle. As it stands though, youll have hard time finding a better game to sit down and play with if you have children or younger siblings, considering neither of you should get bored with LEGO Batman 2s incredibly fun gameplay.", "date": "June 22, 2012", "grade": "A-"}
