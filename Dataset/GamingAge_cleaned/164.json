Before Id even played a moment of it, I was ready to declare it my new favourite game.Turns out that even I have my limits when it comes to word games.This comes down almost entirely to how Word Wheel is structured. Wheels have 9 letters (8 spokes and 1 hub), and you have to spell every single word you can using the middle letter. While I find this idea hugely fun in theory, in practice it can sometimes turn into a slog. Like, one of the wheels spells out orchestra, with the letter A in the middle. Do you have any idea how many 4- to 9-letter words can be formed with those letters? Its a lot, and somewhere along the line it goes from, how many words can I spell? to I need how many more words now?Dont get me wrong: now that Ive played the heck out of it on the Switch, Im going to buy it on the Vita too. I really, really like word games, after all. But unless you have a love of word games that borders on the obsessive, I suspect that Word Wheel will feel more like a chore than a fun way to pass the time. If youre in the mood for a solid puzzle game, youre probably better off investing in one of Lightwoods other games.", "date": "June 17, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
