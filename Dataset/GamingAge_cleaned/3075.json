These monochromatic cyclops went on to star in 3 titles on the platform before seemingly going dormant. However 2017 saw their return as their inaugural title made a reemerged on the PS4so one would assume that the 2 sequels would quickly follow. Almost a year would pass before the fandom would start stirring and thankfully amongst them was probably one of the loudest voices in gaming. Greg Miller, the former face IGN and co-founder Kinda Funny. Miller would demand answers from Sony, sometimes asking the right people such as Shuhei Yoshida then President of SIE Worldwide Studios and sometimes random people within Sony such as Cory Barlog, creative director of Sony Santa Monica. Either his persistence has paid off or Sony just remembered it had this ready to launch Patapon 2 Remastered finally graced PlayStation 4 in 2020.The Patapon race seeks to find the Earthend to gaze upon IT and gain eternal contentment. Given that there was a sequel to their first title its probably safe to say these little guys havent found IT. So their journey continues across the ocean to a new land, however the seas were not kind and shipwrecked their boat scattering their tribe to the winds. Your role in this title is that of God, you beat the sacred drum to motivate the patapon to action. Play the right sequence on beat and your troops will spring to action, play nonsense or off beat the patapon will fall on their faces. As you and your wards traverse further you will recover the 4 drums which will enable you to aid the patapon in their journey.The games controls are pretty simple, each drum is assigned to each face button. Songs are usually 4 beats long. Comboing songs will eventually set you into Fever Mode which will make the actions performed by the patapon more effective. It sounds all simple on paper but keeping the beat can be tough for a lot of us who are rhythmically challenged. The game mitigates this by having an easy mode as well as a flashing frame on the screen which acts as a metronome. However being able to keep a beat will not be the only metric for success. Youll need to build up your troops by expanding your unit types and forging new equipment to ensure that the your army will be able to fend off the eldritch horrors they will face. Having to replay stages to farm resources will extend your time with your followers.The enhancements of this remake are rather nonplussedon one hand the in game graphics look extremely sharp and vibrant, but on the other hand the in-game cinematics look like they were created in the PS1 era, extremely blurry and low res. The tip screens that are interstitials between stages look like they were resized from assets that were meant for the PSPs 4.3 inch screen. Another unintentional defect of this port might be the fact of input lag being introduced since the video hardware that will be used to play this game is not a fixed constantso much so that one of the tips on the reviewers god was is to plug headphones into your DualShock 4 to eliminated any lag. So my struggles with keeping the beat isnt all my fault perhaps? Dispute all this the title is priced at an extremely reasonable $14.99, so its easier to forgive the barebones nature of this title.", "date": "February 11, 2020", "grade": "B"}
