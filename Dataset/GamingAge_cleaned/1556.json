{"name": "Once Upon A Jester", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/04/once-upon-a-jester-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Once Upon A Jester is by far the greatest game of its genre Ive ever played.Of course, its a very specific microgenre, so its not like theres a tonne of competition: its a game about actors putting on plays based on feedback they receive from audience members. Whats more, Ive only played one other game in this very niche microgenre  the thoroughly mediocre Rainsdowne Players  so its not like Once Upon A Jester had a tonne of competition for the title.However, even if I were to expand the range of games Im comparing it to, I think Once Upon A Jester would still come out looking pretty favourably, since I love everything about it.For starters, its pretty original (even if theres at least one other game out there that has a similar mechanic). The game is built around two thieves, Jester and Sok, trying to gain access to the Kings castle by winning a drama competition that requires them to travel from town to town, winning bouquets from adoring crowds. They win the bouquets by talking to townsfolk and overhearing conversations about what people are in the mood for that particular night. That means if you notice people are in a lovey-dovey kind of mood, your play should focus on romance, while if they want something more philosophical, you should focus on the drama.What makes Once Upon A Jester really enjoyable, however, is how funny it all plays out. The story plays up its absurdities without ever becoming too absurd, whether its by giving Jester and Sok a rival theatrical duo consisting of a man and his goat, or introducing a character with all kinds of pomp and circumstance and then promptly killing him off, or having a group of squabbling ice cream sellers who dont fully understand how business works. The dialogue is also top notch  albeit, again, in a humorous sort of way. You have funny songs (my favourite line: I thought of the times / you tried to steal all my beans), you have dialogue prompts with nothing but weird choices, and you have weird tangents that dont feel like non-sequiturs because, in a loopy way, they still play into the story. All of it is elevated by voice acting (and singing) thats clearly done by amateurs, but that never sound amateurish. Its filled with heart and a sense of humour, and it fits the vibe of the game perfectly. And its a vibe I greatly enjoy, if you couldnt already tell. Once Upon A Jester isnt like too many other games out there, but if youre willing to give it a chance, youll find that it does what it sets out to do incredibly well.", "date": "April 5, 2023", "grade": "A"}
