I know that the learning benefits are math and spelling games are probably questionable at best, but I think think theres something incredibly fun  in a deeply nerdy kind of way, of course  about any game where you have to spell words or do quick, basic math equations as time ticks away on you.Seeing as that latter description fits S.U.M.  Slay Uncool Monsters pretty much perfectly, it should come as no surprise that Im addicted to it. S.U.M. is a math-based dungeon crawler  though, truthfully, the dungeon-crawling aspect of the game is fairly minimal, since you dont actually have to explore anything. You just click on a dungeon, and the game immediately starts throwing monsters with math problems at you and all you do is solve them.Obviously, youll be able to tell if that sort of thing appeals to you just by reading it. And its not a case where I feel like Im underselling a game by not being able to describe it properly  literally all there is to do here is basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The factors are all under 10, too, so its really more a test of how well and how quickly you can recall your basic math skills than how good you are at actually doing complicated math.Nonetheless, I love it. Though my love isnt totally without some qualifications. For example, it feels like the game would work much better with a touchscreen  having to slowly drag your cursor around a grid from one number to the other with your thumbsticks feels kind of clunky. Whats more, youre given an ample life bar, so it rarely feels like youre ever in danger of failing a dungeon.But that just means more math, which is only a good thing. Theres something awfully satisfying about getting in a groove and answering question after question, and S.U.M.  Slay Uncool Monsters is built around allowing you to do just that. It never gets in its own way, which is a bigger achievement than many games can ever muster. Sure, its basically designed for Grade 2 students learning their times tables  but when it comes to S.U.M.  Slay Uncool Monsters, thats the sort of nostalgia I can get behind.", "date": "January 26, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
