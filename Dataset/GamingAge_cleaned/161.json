{"name": "My Friend Pedro", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/06/my-friend-pedro-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "My Friend Pedro is so good, it makes me want to watch people play it on YouTube.This actually a pretty big admission, coming from me. See, I cant stand Lets Play videos, and the only time Ill watch someone else playing a game is when Im stuck somewhere and I cant find a text walkthrough. So for me to want to watch other people play a game should tell you a lot about how good it is.Admittedly, it should also tell you that Im also kind of bad at it  or, at least, that I dont play My Friend Pedro in the way that its meant to be played. The game is designed to be a fast-moving ballet of murder and bloodshed, with your character gliding and jumping and flipping across the screen, shooting every last person that gets in your way.My style of play, by contrast, is slow, plodding, and methodical. While I like to go in with guns blazing, I also do so in a way that doesnt come anywhere close to My Friend Pedros full speed. Hence why Id like to see other, more skilled people play this game the way its really meant to be played.That said, even if Im not anywhere close to amazing at it, My Friend Pedro is still a blast to play, regardless of how you play it. Even at my slower speed, its so much fun to parkour your way through hallways and factories and urban rubble, sending bullets flying every which way as you obliterate your enemies. And even if you fail, theres a generous checkpoint system, which means you can always just keep trying until you get it right  though, obviously, your score wont nearly be as impressive.The game is also helped by the fact its  and I apologize now for this pun, but I cant help myself  kind of bananas. The whole thing is built on the fact youre told by a sentient banana to kill everybody, and you just go along with it. It doesnt make any more sense the further in you get, but it does heighten the feeling that youre just flying along by the seat of your pants.Because its a) from Devolver and b) insanely violent, I can imagine that My Friend Pedro will get at least a few Hotline Miami comparisons. And while theres certainly a hint of that game here, make no mistake: My Friend Pedro is its own beast  one thats gloriously over-the-top, full of well-designed levels and good controls, and, above all else, ridiculously fun.", "date": "June 20, 2019", "grade": "A"}
