While its not a full price game  which is roughly how much youd have to pay to buy a physical version of the board game  youre still paying significantly more to play Ticket to Ride on PS4 than youd pay to play it on your iOS/Android device, even though the experience is mostly the same. For that matter, its twice as much as youd pay for the Xbox 360 version, which, again, is almost exactly the same, only the 360 version doesnt let you/require you to control the game with your phone (and, obviously, looks a little less clean and crisp).In other words, youre paying a PlayStation tax for an experience thats not really any different than you can get on a variety of other devices at a much cheaper price. If youve ever played the game anywhere else, this version probably isnt going to wow you. Of course, if you have played it anywhere else, youll realize that theres nothing really wrong with that. Its become a classic board game for a reason, and the fact that Asmodee Digital have transferred that experience onto the PS4 without losing anything deserves to be celebrated.For those people who havent yet been fortunate enough to play Ticket to Ride, here it is in a nutshell: its a puzzle game in which youre building a railroad network on a map. You draw different-coloured cards, and race your fellow players to collect enough colours to claim lines connecting cities. Whoever lays down the most track while also creating certain lines (i.e. New York to Los Angeles, or Seattle to Miami) wins.Its not a complex game (and if I made it sound like one, thats because Im terrible at describing things), but thats what makes it so fun and so addictive. Its easy enough that you could play with almost literally anyone, and its challenging enough that you wont get bored by it, even if youre playing solo.In fact, just about the only reason not to get Ticket to Ride on PS4 is if youve played it to death elsewhere at a much cheaper price  which, to be fair, is probably a lot of people. Still, if youre looking for a way to experience a classic board game on your PS4, Ticket to Ride offers exactly that.", "date": "January 4, 2019", "grade": "B+"}
