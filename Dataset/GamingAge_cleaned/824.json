{"name": "Lichtspeer", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/06/lichtspeer-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "From a reviewing perspective, Im always a little fond of games in which the calculus is simple. Sure, its the easy way out and a rather reductive way of looking at things, but it makes describing games a breeze.Take Lichtspeer, for example. Its one of those titles where you can see precisely what went into making it: take a little bit of Angry Birds (or Crush the Castle, or whatever other physics-based game you fancy), add in some javelin, and round it all out with a score that could easily pass for a lost Ratatat album. Throw in a futuristic glam metal aesthetic, and you have all the ingredients for the game ready to go.Of course, just because its easy to describe, it doesnt necessarily have to follow that it all works. Thats not an issue for Lichtspeer, though. Its one of those games thats so wonderfully intuitive, you cant help but get sucked in immediately. Crazy-looking monsters are advancing on you at various speeds, and all you can do to stop them is hurl your lichtspeer at them. Its pretty simple, but as is the case with its forebears, its also incredibly addictive.Just about my only criticism of Lichtspeer is that the Vita version doesnt take advantage of the handhelds touchscreen to allow for touch controls. If theres one thing Angry Birds showed, its that physics-based games are made for touch controls, and they get a little more awkward when you have to use old-fashioned buttons and thumbsticks. Obviously, it still works well enough here, but that doesnt make it any less of a missed opportunity.", "date": "June 2, 2017", "grade": "A"}
