{"name": "Godzilla", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/07/godzilla-review-for-ps4-ps3/", "text": "Godzilla was released this week on PS4 and PS3 from Bandai Namco without a great deal of fanfare, but if youre a kaiju fan in general, I think its worth a look. The game features a hefty roster of Toho superstars, culled from different Godzilla eras, which makes for one of the more all-encompassing group of Godzilla heroes and villains a Godzilla game has seen thus far. Jet Jaguar makes the cut, as does Mothra, Mechagodzilla, Space Godzilla, Biollante, and a whole lot more. Its not quite as fleshed out as it should be, but as a sort of love letter to the series, it does a pretty solid job.Godzillas gameplay is divided up into a series of modes. The campaign mode is God of Destruction, which takes Godzilla across a series of stages set against the backdrop of Tokyo and other locales featured in the films. As the player controlling Godzilla, youll stomp across cityscapes, crushing buildings, blowing up tanks, and swatting helicopters out of the sky. Your objective in each stage is to destroy all power generators, and occasionally fend off an invading kaiju, while blowing everything up around you to collect G-Energy, increasing your size and power.The rest of modes are more or less variations on this formula. If you dont want to play as Godzilla, you can select the Invade option within God of Destruction, which allows you to select any other unlocked monster and strips away most of the story bits (which arent that great to begin with). Or, you can opt to defend, pitting you against attacking kaiju and attempting to keep the destruction factor at a minimum level.The biggest drawback to these three modes is that theyre all pretty repetitive. Most stages dont last long, even if youre trying to go for full destruction, which can benefit you by increasing the overall power and size of your selected monster. But smashing the same buildings over and over again, no matter how impressive and true to the series it is, gets old quickly. The highlights come from battling the other kaiju, but even those fights can feel a bit tedious, with some serious balancing issues between monsters that make certain fights more frustrating than fun. If youre down for some mindless rampaging with your favorite Godzilla character, youll likely get some enjoyment out of this in short bursts, but Id urge anyone that doesnt have some serious love for the series to give this a rental first.", "date": "July 20, 2015", "grade": "B"}
