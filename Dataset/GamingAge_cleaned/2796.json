{"name": "Alwas Legacy", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/12/alwas-legacy-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "I suspect that if you really want to get the most out of Alwas Legacy, youll need to have been a fan of its predecessor, Alwas Awakening.Its not that theres some deep, impenetrable lore that you need to know in order to understand whats happening in Alwas Legacy. Nor does it build on some crazy, unique gameplay that the first game established. Rather, its that Alwas Legacy is a pretty generic Metroidvania platformer, and unless youve formed a bond with the characters and the series thanks to the first game, theres not a lot here thatll set the game apart compared to the many, many other games of this genre that populate the Switchs software library.I mean, I can see why some people have that bond. Alwas Legacy has some nice retro-inspired graphics, and its got a map thats big without being unwieldy. If youre looking for a Metroidvania platformer that you can sink your teeth into for a week or so, you can do that here, and youll be rewarded with pretty much everything youd expect from one of these games. You can explore to your hearts content to find all kinds of secret areas, and the combat and platforming elements are solidly done.But the same could be said for any number of other games on the Switch. Alwas Legacy is better than many of them, but not as good as others. Its fine for what it is, but if you want something thatll really blow you away, this probably isnt it.", "date": "December 8, 2020", "grade": "B"}
