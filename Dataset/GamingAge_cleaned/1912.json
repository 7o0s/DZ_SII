It feels like one of the games that could have graced their systems back in the 1980s.I mean, some minor changes would have to be made. The brightly-coloured visuals would probably need to be toned down a little  but given that were talking about 2D platformer where you control a ball, probably not significantly. Likewise, the soundtrack would probably need to be downgraded a little, but not hugely  while the score is somewhat modern-sounding ambient electronic music, its easy to imagine it being redone in chiptunes style without too much changing.The gameplay, though, could easily be dropped back into the early 80s, and I dont think anyone would have batted an eye. The premise is very simple: youre controlling multiple balls scattered across single-screen levels, and youre trying to join them up without any of them running into obstacles.While Kombinera may not offer anything new, it still finds ways to be challenging. Punishingly so, in fact  there are 300 levels on offer here, and they get insanely difficult around level 15 or 20. Theres a brief period at the beginning where the game almost holds your hand, but thats given up very quickly and youre left to die  and die, and die, and die.Of course, that means that when you succeed, its all the more rewarding. Mind you, it also means that youve got to really be willing to persevere, because there are lots of levels here with no margin for error, and the game delights in finding new ways to kill off your little balls. Kombinera doesnt try to hide the fact that its tough, so if youre after that kind of near-impossible difficulty, youll want to check it out.", "date": "April 26, 2022", "grade": "B"}
