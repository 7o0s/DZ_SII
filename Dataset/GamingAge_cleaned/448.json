I dont mean that its heavily influenced by Space Invaders. I mean that its basically a carbon copy of Space Invaders, with one or two fairly minor changes.There are worse things in the world for a game to be, I guess. After all, the original Space Invaders came out about four decades ago, but it still holds up today as a perfect example of simple, addictive gameplay. Super Destronaut DX may not add all that much to the original, but I suppose you could also say that it at least has the good sense to not get in its own way, either.As for the aforementioned changes, were mostly talking about cosmetic differences. Most obviously, everything here is brightly coloured. For obvious reasons, that wasnt the case back when Space Invaders came out, so Super Destronaut DX is probably more pleasing on the eyes.The other change is that Super Destronaut DX features a couple of different modes. Nothing earth-shaking, to be sure  time attacks, coupled with challenges along the lines of Shoot X number of enemies or Score X number of points  but enough that the game is able to offer players a little bit of variety.But only a little bit. As I said, Super Destronaut DX is essentially Space Invaders for the present day, so your feelings on that classic will dictate entirely how you feel about this modern update.", "date": "August 3, 2018", "grade": "C"}
