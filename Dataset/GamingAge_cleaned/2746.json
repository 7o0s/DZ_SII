{"name": "Turtle Beach Fuel Compact VR Charging Station impressions for Meta Quest 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/02/turtle-beach-fuel-compact-vr-charging-station-impressions/", "text": "Not only is the Turtle Beach Fuel Compact VR Charging Station one of the most useful accessories I own for the Meta Quest 2, but its nice to not have an eyesore on my desk knowing I will barely use it because the stand I previously used didnt charge anything. Im not someone that can spend a lot of time with VR games having a 6-year-old and needing to have eyes in the room most of the time, but having the ability to place not only the headset, but the controllers on a single charging station, knowing when I pick it up for use it will have fully charged battery is satisfying.The Fuel VRs sleek design was the first positive even from just the initial images I had seen. Many VR headset chargers are similarly designed to hold the unit and charge but tend to be on the taller mount style like my existing PlayStation VR headset, which has collected dust for over a year and a half. Having the Turtle Beach charger designed to lay flat and charge the controllers on the same dock is something I hope other companies will adopt, especially with PS VR2 on the way (wink, wink.)Another great feature is the simple magnetic charging piece. You place this tiny USB C tip into the headset and when you rest it on the dock, it will line up and charge without effort. The only challenge is if you use the Quest 2 Elite strap as I do and must remove that cable and charge that on its own, which is not a deal breaker by any means. The other great addition is the inclusion of two rechargeable batteries and replacement covers with the charge ports to allow quick drop in charging.Personally, the only challenge I faced was finding a spot to always keep the Fuel VR charger it since Im used to having it in a case where it can be easier to store. There is also not a cover so if you plan on having a lapse in VRing I advise to get it back into a case so the Quest 2 doesnt collect too much dust.With the PS VR2 launching next week, I hope the 3rd party chargers share a similar design as I plan on spending some quality time with it when available. If you are in the market for a sweet and reliable Meta Quest 2 charging dock, I cannot recommend the Turtle Beach Fuel Compact VR Charging Station enough.", "date": "February 16, 2023", "grade": null}
