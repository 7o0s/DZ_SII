Its not good. Its not bad. It justis.I mean, what else is there to say about a platformer where the main characters are interchangeable blobs on a mission to rescue more interchangeable blobs? The graphics are blandly colorful. The gameplay is straight out of Platforming 101. If Bounce Rescue does a single thing that innumerable other games havent already done  both significantly better and significantly worse  Id be astonished. Its just that meh.If I really, really pushed myself, I could think of a few things I dislike about it, I guess. Like, why are the two main character blobs gendered, with a blue boy blob and a pink girl blob? Considering theres zero difference between them apart from their colors, and their respective genders have no bearing whatsoever on how they play, it seems kind of weird to even have the two options.I have some minor issues with Bounce Rescue on the gameplay side, too. For example, the fact that theres not much of a checkpoint system at work here: you can either play the game on Easy and get an infinite amount of lives to play each level, or you can go for trophies on Normal and have to start each level from the beginning every time you die. It makes the game get a little bit frustrating pretty quickly, and it doesnt help that every so often on Normal, for no discernible reason, youre rescued by a little bubble and you can float yourself to safety. Theres no obvious rhyme or reason to it, but its here, and its enough to leave you feeling baffled.", "date": "May 6, 2016", "grade": "C"}
