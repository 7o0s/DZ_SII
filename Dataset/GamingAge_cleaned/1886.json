And thats not really meant to be a negative statement. It just feels like a game thats out of place with the current market, where mascot based platformers arent a monthly occurrence any more. Its hard to shake that PS2 era platformer feeling that this gamebased on the Disney XD cartoon that I didnt even know existedcertainly evokes.But its not a bad game, surprisingly! However, this certainly isnt the Pac-Man that I grew up with, what with the high-school setting, lack of Ms. Pac-Man, and his friendship with former series villains Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Clyde. Everyone is certainly a lot more talkative, and theres a lot of Pac-Man like characters that resemble the rotund yellow hero in different shapes and sizes, all with cutesy names that play off of sphere based puns. The story elements arent the selling point here though, and thankfully they dont take up a lot of your time either.Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures is broken up into series of worlds, generally themed around different environments, not unlike every platformer youve ever played. These worlds are further divided into levels, with a diminutive overworld map to explore with some optional paths to progress along that give you some limited options in how you tackle stages.The individual stages see Pac-Man jumping and double jumping, along with chomping down enemy ghosts as his core abilities. Power Pellets litter stages as your de facto collectible item, with optional coins and other secrets scattered about. At the end of each stage youll gain a piece of fruit, which can be used at your hub location to unlock retro themed mini-games that are of questionable quality. Ghosts are generally consumed in a single bite, and you can chain chomps from one ghost to the next if theyre close enough. If you can eat five in quick succession, you can unleash a powerful yell thatll put nearby ghosts into their familiar blue-hued scared state, making them easy pickings for consumption.Most of this is basic platformer 101 material, which Ghostly Adventures does pretty well at. It doesnt help the game stand out against better titles in the genre, but it certainly doesnt leave a bad taste in your mouth either. Its very average for the most part, but actually stands out a bit more simply because theres not a lot of retail released, mascot platformers on consoles to pick from nowadays.But there are some slight traces of brilliance in Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures otherwise non-exceptional platforming designs. Most of this comes from the various power-ups that Pac-Man can consume, granting him new abilities that are necessary to overcome obstacles or defeat certain enemies. Some of these abilities are a little basic with limited uses, like the fire power-up that grants Pac-Man the ability to throw fireballs (gimmick infringement!), or the ice power-up thats basically the same but with a different element.But then theres the stone power-up, which turns Pac-Man into a giant ball, and is usually featured in stages that feel like something smartly culled from Super Monkey Ball. Or the chameleon power-up that grants Pac-Man a sticky tongue to swing across precariously placed posts in legitimately tricky platforming sequences. The overall inventiveness of the power-ups is all over the place, but some of the more unique abilities help make an otherwise standard experience stand out more.", "date": "October 29, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
