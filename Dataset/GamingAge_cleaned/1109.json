While Blizzard has certainly made a name for themselves in RTS / RPG circles over their many, many years of existence, a team-based shooter didnt exactly seem like a perfect match to me. That said, as more and more of Overwatch came to light during the development process, and as various closed/open betas rolled around, it became clear we had little to worry about. And now that the finished product is here? Well, Overwatch has put most multiplayer shooters to shame much in the way that DOOM did for shooter campaigns just a couple weeks ago.On the surface, there doesnt seem to be a whole lot to Overwatch. Its certainly not a mode heavy sort of shooter, with no single player campaign to speak of, and a single rotating special mode that rolls around weekly in addition to the standard rotation of maps. Theres 12 maps at the onset, and a solid roster of characters to play, but when looking at the features on paper, Overwatch does seem a bit bare. Thankfully thats offset by how much fun it is to play, and how utterly addicting the game can be. Ive had a hard time tearing myself away from playing it this week, and will likely devote dozens if not hundreds of hours to the game going forward. That addictive nature is certainly one thing that Blizzard knows how to capitalize on, and theyve done a solid job with it in Overwatch. Its not just the carrot on the stick element of loot boxes and random unlocks, but its the easy to pick-up and play nature of Overwatch that keeps drawing you back in.The learning curve with Overwatch is hardly severe. Theres a small tutorial, but that seems more geared towards those that have never touched a shooter before. Assuming you have some knowledge of how these games work, youll likely be able to pick any random character, jump in, and start having fun. Honestly, I think thats the best way to start out, dont get too hung up on class roles and skills, instead just work your way through the roster and see what ends up fitting your preferred playstyle. Despite characters filling similar roles, like tanks, support, attack and so on, they all feel pretty unique. And it doesnt take long to figure what character works well on any given map, or gravitates towards defense or offense. By and large, most characters work well with just about anyone, meaning you can generally pair up with another character and perform effectively, even if they dont seem particularly compatible at first.Thats not to say high-level play doesnt exist in Overwatch. Ive certainly been bodied a number of times by teams that are clearly familiar with one another, and have dedicated themselves to a set role on the team. Theres a lot of room for improvement with any player, but again, youll be able to get a whole lot of enjoyment out of Overwatch early on. This in turn will lead to better strategies, more familiarity with the maps and characters, and helps make the journey from scrub to pro (or as close as you can get to pro) enjoyable throughout.I also love the overall look of Overwatch. Its a bright, vibrant take on first-person shooters that we still dont see all that often. The character designs are fun and cartoony, and lend themselves well to fan-scripted backstories and theories. And its not just the character design, but also the map design, skins, music, and voiceover work that manages to blend Overwatch into a cohesive, fun, all-ages work of art. While weve become used to Blizzards ability to capitalize and even revitalize their decade-plus old properties like Diablo, StarCraft, and Warcraft, its nice to see that they still have the chops to bust out something wholly unique like Overwatch.", "date": "May 31, 2016", "grade": "A"}
