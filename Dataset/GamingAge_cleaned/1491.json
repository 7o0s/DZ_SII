{"name": "Desert Ashes", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/03/desert-ashes-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "According to people who presumably know these things, Desert Ashes is essentially an Advance Wars clone, filtered through a steampunk-meets-Tim Burton art sensibility. Now, I should confess right off the bat that I dont know if the first part of that comparison is true, having never played any of the Advance Wars games. The comparison seems to have been made enough that its probably appropriate, but I want to mention it with the disclaimer that I cant vouch for how accurate it is.That said, I can look at images and gameplay videos of Advance Wars, and  yeah, I can see why people would make the comparison. Theyre both turn-based strategy games, and in both you have an array of different ground and air units at your disposal to take out the enemy forces.Then again, the same could be said about any number of other turn-based strategy games (and Wikipedia knows theres no shortage of them), so Im not sure why theres necessarily a direct line from Advance Wars straight through to Desert Ashes. It seems to me that in such a relatively narrowly-defined genre, you set yourself apart via story and graphics, not necessarily gameplay.Of course, even by those standards, theres still not a lot here. The game is basically one long war between the Winged Crusade and the Landians, and it doesnt get much deeper than these two sides are at war with each other. If you really love that plot, there are two additional episodes to buy for under $2 each on top of the core free-to-play game, plus you can go online and take the battle to multiplayer. On the plus side, you wouldnt be going into those additional episodes blind, since a big chunk of the first free chapter is a tutorial. The downside is that you also wouldnt be going in with much narrative momentum, either, but hey, at least youd know how to play. (And to the games credit, its controls are pretty easy to pick up.)All of which brings us back to the second part of that initial comparison  to the Tim Burton/steampunk-style graphics. And here, finally, is where Desert Ashes genuinely shines. Its not a wholly original style, obviously, but its still compelling enough that the game is fun to look at. The two sides both look like mutant bugs out of some brightly-coloured nightmare, and that goes whether youre getting a top-down view or a quick glimpse of the two sides engaging in battle.", "date": "March 12, 2015", "grade": "B-"}
