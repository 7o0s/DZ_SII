{"name": "Twin Robots", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/04/twin-robots-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "Twin Robots has a pretty interesting backstory: it was originally released on the Ouya back in 2014, and over the ensuing years the game wound its way through mobile devices, the Wii U, PC, Switch, PS4 and the Vita. If nothing else, the game has proven to be durable.Unfortunately, that backstory is pretty much the only thing about Twin Robots that could be described as interesting. Otherwise, its just your standard co-op platformer where youre controlling a pair of robots, helping them escape some sort of lab over the course of 28 levels.Even though the game is short, it doesnt take long for Twin Robots to feel like it falls into a rut, largely because all the levels feel so similar. They may be laid out a little differently, and they may get progressively more difficult, but the set-up always repeats itself: one robot is trapped in a tube, the other one has to find the switch that opens the tube, and then, ideally, both of them exit the level together.The good news is that, within its limited scope, Twin Robots is perfectly fine. The controls are as precise as they need to be for a moderately tough platformer, with jumps that fall just shy of feeling a little floaty, andwell, thats about all there is to judge here, since the game isnt very demanding. My only real complaint  beyond the repetitiveness  is that the levels dont automatically restart when your lead robot falls into one of the many death traps littered throughout the game.As complaints go, thats obviously not a very big one. But Twin Robots doesnt operate on a scale that allows for massive screw-ups. Its not particularly ambitious, which means that it neither wows you, nor does it ever run the risk of mind-blowingly bad. Its worth checking out if you need an average platformer, but dont expect to be thinking about it beyond the few hours itll take you to beat it.", "date": "April 18, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
