Consequently, any time a game has come along that promises itll allow me to flex my vocabulary, Ive been eager to play it  for better and for worse.In other words, Im not even going to pretend that my experience with Word Puzzles by POWGI will even remotely resemble how most other people will see it.After all, where most people will likely see something that falls under the general category of edutainment, in my eyes I see my next gaming addiction, the kind of thing thats going to worm its way into my brain and leave me seeing word patterns every time I close my eyes. This is, of course, an atypical way of looking at the game.Not that I care  not when there are so many words to be made. For me, the only real questions are things like: do I blow through all the word mazes (where you follow letters through a maze without any lines, forming words as you go until there are no letters left without a word), or balance my time equally between that and the circles, where youre given a Venn diagram of three clusters of letters and you have to figure out the overlapping letter for all three clusters? Or do I forgo both in favour of flowers, in which you have 12 pairs of letters and you have to figure out how to arrange them around two common middle letters, along with a bit of one word, the word search where you have to find (you guessed it) one word amongst a grid comprised only of the letters in that word? Or maybe I just focus my attention crossovers, in which you first solve two-word crossword puzzles, and then use one common letter from each to spell another word? With hundreds and hundreds of puzzles available in each, the possibilities seem almost endless.And thats without even getting into the fact that the game offers DLC, which expands the line-up of available puzzles even more. As someone whos resolutely against DLCwell, I have to admit its enough to make me think about reconsidering that position, in a way that few other games ever have. I mean, I think its bad, but at the same time: more word puzzles.Again, I know my experience with Word Puzzles by POWGI is kind of atypical. Most people, I expect, will not be as addicted as I am. But if you do enjoy a good game of Scrabble, this just might be your game of the year.", "date": "December 18, 2018", "grade": "A"}
