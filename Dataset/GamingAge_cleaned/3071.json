{"name": "Demolish & Build 2018", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/02/demolish-build-2018-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Going into Demolish & Build (or, as its officially titled, Demolish & Build 2018), I had visions of destroying stuff Red Faction Guerrilla-style. After all, right in its description, it promises you can (u)se big machines to demolish huge buildings or go close and personal and use your hammer. If thats not a pretty good approximation of Red Faction Guerrilla, I dont know what is.Alas, its not nearly as good (or as fun, or as well-made) as that. You do get to use machines to demolish buildings, and you can break up some stuff with a sledgehammer, but thats where the similarities end. The destruction here is much more limited, as youll learn right off the bat, especially if, say, you immediately start whaling away on the nearest building the moment you start the game (spoiler: nothing happens).Instead, the destruction is on a much smaller scale. You can bash away at toilets and sinks in a derelict washroom, for example  but only after you strip out the electrical wiring and remove the radiators. Likewise, you can tear down a decrepit old bar, but only after you first remove the chairs and knock out the windows. Safety first, I guess?Even that small-scale destruction might be fun in the right circumstances, but Demolish & Build goes out of its way to be as boring and difficult as possible. Ostensibly, its a game about building (pun unintentional) a company from the ground up. Youre supposed to start your demolition business from scratch, with only a sledgehammer to your name, and then, as you gradually build up your reputation by taking on jobs and getting money through various side hustles like parking lots and rental houses, you can buy bigger and bigger machinery.In practice, this means a lot of repetitive jobs at locations that are too far apart, driving a clunky car through a seemingly uninhabited town, trying to navigate using the least helpful map Ive ever encountered in a game. The game rarely helps you out, and even when it gives you hints about how things are supposed to work, they dont tell you much.Of course, even when it does make it clear what youre supposed to do, the games performance will make it a challenge to do it. The performance here is abysmal in every respect. The controls dont work, and youll often be forced to go in and out of menus until the game finally recognizes that youre trying to choose something. The draw distance is terrible, and youre better off watching the little map in the corner of the screen than trying to navigate using the road in front of you, since its all popping in as you drive. And, to top it all off, theres a massive mountain in the the middle of the town, and if you try to drive up it youll end up falling through the earth.", "date": "February 17, 2020", "grade": "D"}
