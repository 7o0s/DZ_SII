A baby-making simulator? Sure, why not. A game where you run around downtown Tokyo, ripping off peoples clothes? One of my favorite games of the year. A game where you basically masturbate your Vita to reveal young girls in revealing clothes and postures? Far better than it has any right to be. With Senran Kagura: Shinovi Versus, however, I think Ive reached my limit, the point where even Im looking at a game and saying, Okay, thats a bit much. Its basically all boobs, panties and dialogue that sounds like it was written by people whove never actually interacted with girls before.To some extent, of course, similar criticisms  and worse  couldve been levelled against Conception II, Akibas Trip and Monster Monpiece. The difference, however, is that all of them featured some pretty solid core gameplay, and would likely be good even if they didnt rely on such titillating hooks, whereas strip away Senran Kaguras T&A, and youre not left with a whole lot.Actually, thats not completely true. In the games defense, the fighting controls arent that bad. Admittedly, this is largely because youre usually fighting so many enemies, you can afford to just flail around wildly and expect to hit something. But still, Id be lying if I didnt admit that the quality of the action is single-handedly good enough to say that Senran Kagura: Shinovi Versus isnt completely devoid of merit.At least at first. After a while, the game starts feeling more than a little repetitive. It may allow you to interact/flirt with the other girls, and change your lingerie, and win lingerie, and generally do lingerie-related things, but once youre actually playing through a stage, it becomes pretty difficult to differentiate between them all, since theyre all so similar. If youve seen one level where you fight through hordes of murderous henchmen to tear the clothes off your over-endowed rival, youve really seen them all.In theory, of course, youd be able to tell the levels apart by their various characters and dialogues, but lets be realistic here: the characters are exactly as flat as youd expect from a franchise that essentially got its start because a developer wanted 3D boobs (which is kind of ironic, come to think of it). Sure, theres a storyline about ninja students and rival schools and whatnot, but thats all just window dressing for girls making single-entendre innuendos to each other and, by turns, dreaming of candy and complaining about being fat. On some level, I guess, it counts as progress that we have girls getting nosebleeds over other girls, but in a broader sense  i.e. the sense where otaku guys just want to see lesbian schoolgirls getting it on  using the word progress may be overstating things.", "date": "October 20, 2014", "grade": "C-"}
