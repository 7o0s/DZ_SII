{"name": "Zeroptian Invasion", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/05/zeroptian-invasion-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Zeroptian Invasion is Space Invaders.I dont mean its kind of like Space Invaders. I dont mean its heavily influenced by Space Invaders, because that could imply that it does something with that influence. No, I mean that Zeroptian Invasion is about as close to a Space Invaders clone as a game can legally get without violating copyright and trademark laws.In other words, your feelings towards Zeroptian Invasion will be dictated entirely by how much you like Space Invaders. Do you like shooting at lines of enemies making their way slowly down the screen? Then youll like this. Do you feel like the formula got played out about three and a half decades ago? Then youll be bored of this. Whatever your feelings about Space Invaders, Zeroptian Invasion will do precisely zero to change your mind one way or another.I get that this is kind of a lazy way to write about Zeroptian Invasion. But, in my defense, this is a lazy kind of game. The most innovative thing it does is give you the option of CRT mode, which toggles between making the game look crisp and clean, or making it kinda-sorta imitate how games looked a few decades ago. Apart from thatI dont know, you could get into the debate of whether this is more Galaga than Space Invaders. Either way, though, both of those games are classics that will continue to be remembered for decades to come, whereas Im going to forget Zeroptian Invasion even existed within a few minutes of finishing this review.", "date": "May 22, 2019", "grade": "C"}
