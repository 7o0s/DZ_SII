{"name": "Go Vacation", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/11/go-vacation-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "It shouldnt be too surprising that Go Vacation seems like a throwback to a previous generation of Nintendo games  back to the Wii, when the success of Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort led to seemingly every publisher trying to get in on the act with some kind of minigame collection. After all, Go Vacation on the Switch is actually just an an updated version of Bandai Namcos take on the genre, which was also named Go Vacation.Consequently, it also shouldnt be too surprising that much of the praise  and, more relevantly, much of the criticism  the games got a decade or so ago still applies here.On the positive side, this means the games on offer are generally pretty easy to pick up and play. Whether youre skydiving, skateboarding, horseback riding, or partaking in any of the dozens of other sports available here across four resorts, its not going to take you long to figure out what to do. Moreover, because the level of entry is so low, Go Vacation is the sort of thing you can play with pretty much anybody  even if the Joy-Cons dont have quite the same feel as a Wii Remote, and even if playing the game solo on handheld mode can be a little frustrating at times for reasons Ill get into in a moment, its safe to say that its a game you could play with anybody, from pretty much any age group.However, those are also some pretty major weaknesses of the game too. Sure, the minigames are easy to pick up, but that also means they dont offer all that much depth. You can increase the difficulty a little, but that only does so much  youll still feel like youre doing the same old thing over and over again before too long.The same goes for the controls: if you were fond of motion controls, you may be happy to see them embraced again today, but if you didnt  and I have to admit that once I got passed the initial wow factor, I came to loathe the very notion  then Go Vacation will have you remembering why the Wii sometimes seemed more like a fad than an innovation. Its kind of neat the first time that, say, you steer your skydiver into position by physically moving your controller in that direction; by the fifth time youll just wish you could use thumbsticks like a normal person.I feel like its also important to note that Go Vacation offers more than just minigames: you dont just get the different collections of games at each resort, you also get the physical resorts themselves, where you can befriend people (and dogs!), take photos, sit down at restaurants, and buy new clothing. Id be lying if I said I cared about any of that very much, but Im sure that some people do, and for those people, this game has a lot to offer.But again, from a broader perspective, everything about Go Vacation seems like its trying to import the hottest gaming trends of 2006 into today. If you still feel nostalgia for that era, then check it out, but if youd rather that motion controls and the like stayed firmly in the past, then youll probably want to steer clear.", "date": "November 8, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
