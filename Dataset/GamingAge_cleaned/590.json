While Im sure the very idea offends some people who subscribe to the get good theory of soulslikes, I really enjoyed not dying constantly on my way to the first mini-boss fight and then giving up out of frustration. It gave me a much better appreciation for the game, you know?I know that sounds like Im talking in jest, but I really do mean that. No Place for Bravery can be a challenge even on story mode  as youd expect from a game that makes no attempt to hide it wants to be a 2D, pixelated version of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice  so I can hardly imagine how tough it gets when everything around you can kill you quickly. As it stood, I was pretty regularly dipping into my stash of health potions, since this games world is full of all kinds of monsters trying to kill you from all angles. Not dying constantly meant I was able to enjoy much more of what No Place for Bravery has to offer  and it definitely has quite a bit to offer, starting with its story. The game follows an old warrior, Thorn, on a quest to track down his missing daughter, and along his journey, you discover that the developers put an insane amount of thought into this games world. Theres a lot to uncover here, and the game does a good job of doling it out to you at just the right pace.Also along the way, you get to experience the games score, which is quite exceptional. Its all dark and haunting and moody, and it sets the tone for the game every step of the way. Even as someone who doesnt usually care that much one way or the other about a games music, I noticed it (in a good way, obviously), which speaks to just how great it is.Less great, unfortunately, is the games technical performance. No Place for Bravery struggles when theres a lot of action going on  and seeing as this is an action-filled game, thats definitely not ideal. While the game works and never crashes (which is obviously a very low bar), it also slows down to a crawl as more and more enemies fill the screen, or as you start hacking and dodging and slashing, or as blood and guts start flying everywhere. These things are all pretty common, which means that any raves about No Place for Bravery need to be tempered.But even with that pretty major flaw, No Place for Bravery is still a very solid game. Technical issues may mean that doesnt like up to the standards of the games its trying to emulate, but even so, theres a lot of good stuff going on here, and if you can look past those issues (or even wait for some patches), theres definitely something here worth playing.", "date": "September 30, 2022", "grade": "B"}
