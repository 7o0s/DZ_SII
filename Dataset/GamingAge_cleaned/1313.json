{"name": "Nova-111", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/09/nova-111-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "The more I play Nova-111, the more I feel like developers Funktronic Labs simply looked at Pixeljunk Shooter and thought, Hmm, what if we made it a turn-based real-time strategy game?Theres nothing inherently wrong with that thought, of course. Pixeljunk Shooter was a fine game, so if thats how Nova-111 came to be, it could certainly have had a worse genesis. Even more importantly, Funktronic was founded by Q-Games veterans, which means that if they were being influenced by Pixeljunk, they were at least coming by their influences pretty honestly.But it also means that Nova-111 doesnt come off as super-original, either. After all, in both games youre traversing underground alien worlds in search of missing scientists. When the only thing you have to add to the equation is that, instead of making you worry about moving too quickly and overheating (as was the case with Pixeljunk Shooter), you can only move one space at a time, it should come as little surprise that the overall experiences dont vary that greatly.To Nova-111s credit, of course, it tries to add a little humour to the proceedings. Specificity is a great tool for humour, which means that its kind of hilarious to pick up a scientist and discover that youve just rescued, say, Marie Curie. Likewise, having Dr. Science narrate your movements and rewarding you with Science! definitely hints at a bit of a Portal influence as well.On the downside, however, Nova-111 doesnt have the same visual appeal as its spiritual predecessor. Points for going for a retro-influenced, 70s kind of vibe, to be sure, but at the same time, the games slightly washed-out look, when put side-by-side with Pixeljunk Shooter, just looks kind of tame.", "date": "September 29, 2015", "grade": "B"}
