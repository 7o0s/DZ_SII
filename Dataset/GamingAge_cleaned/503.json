Pretty much the only ones I can even claim to be moderately non-terrible at are those in the Injustice and the Marvel vs Capcom franchises, both of which give ample amounts of handholding to people like me (which is to say, they both simplify cool-looking combos enough that you can pull some off even if you suck terribly).So, when I say that King of Fighters 97 Global Match doesnt seem like a particularly good game, you should keep in mind that it may just be my incompetence speaking. I am horrifically bad at doing almost literally everything the game demands, which  Im not going to lie  may colour my perception of it.In my defense, KOF 97 Global Match is almost incomprehensible if youre going in blind. Theres no tutorial mode, which means that the only way to get better (or to even learn what to do) is read the moves list and get beaten over and over again until you figure out what youre doing. The game does allow you to change the difficulty level, but as far as I could tell, doing so had minimal impact on the games, er, difficulty. Though, again, that may just be my suckiness speaking.Also in my defense, theres a pretty noticeable input lag. Im not the kind of person who usually complains about that, to the point that this may be the first time in my life Ive ever complained about (or even said the words) input lag, but I think its appropriate here. I played KOF 97 Global Match on both PS4 and Vita, and in both cases, it wasnt uncommon for me to have to wait a few moments before the buttons I pressed had any bearing on what was happening on-screen. As you can imagine, in a game where reflexes play an important role, not knowing whether your button presses would do anything could have a severe impact on your enjoyment of the game. Again, though, Ill note my ineptitude.All that said, Im not convinced that my disappointing experience with KOF 97 Global Match can be chalked up entirely to me simply not being good at the game. For one thing, Ill note that many of these same issues have been noted in the games Steam reviews  presumably by people with much more experience and expertise than I have.For another, even if I was amazing at the game, I think Id still be disappointed that the game seems so barebones. Theres no story or plot anywhere to be found; even if you can kind of infer the point of a game called The King of Fighters, its still disappointing that theres not even the hint of a nod towards giving the individual fighters any kind of backstory or motivation. Theres also not a lot of variety on offer in the modes: you can fight single matches, or you can fight team matches. Theres not even much to be said about the games looks  though, given that were talking about the barebones re-release of a twenty-year-old game, thats at least understandable.But I dont think its forgivable, particularly when you factor in everything else here. Whether youre a seasoned fighting game veteran or, like me, youre someone who has sucked at fighting games for as long as they can remember, The King of Fighters 97 Global Match really doesnt have a lot to offer.", "date": "June 18, 2018", "grade": "D+"}
