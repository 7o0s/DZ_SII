Box by Box would be a GOTY contender. Everything about it is absolutely adorable, from the sentient boxes that you play as to the hand-crafted environments that bring to mind games like Tearaway and Yoshis Crafted World. Its hard to play this game and not come away impressed by the amount of love that clearly went into making this world.Its too bad, then, that the same amount of love and care didnt go into the gameplay.Its not that Pile Up! is a bad game. It bills itself as a family-friendly 3D platformer, and thats basically what it delivers. If youre looking for something to play with very young kids, the lack of enemies and unlimited lives  not to mention the co-op gameplay  probably make this an ideal choice.For anyone else, though, its going to be a pretty dull experience. Its hard to imagine anyone being challenged by the puzzles here, since theyre all pretty basic. There are no stakes, with no enemies and no clocks, so you can just wander slowly through each level  though theres a limit to how much wandering you can do, since even if the levels are 3D, everything moves in a pretty linear fashion.To be fair, there are occasional opportunities to explore if you really want to pick up extra coins, but I cant see why youd want to do that. Not only do the coins not serve any purpose, the platforming is kind of terrible  jumps are hit or miss, and the camera is offset just enough that its occasionally challenging to get a proper perspective of where youre going. However, given how unhurried everything is, its not as if you need to pick between picking up some useless coins or rushing through this games four levels  theres plenty of time for both, especially if youre looking to stretch this game out as long as possible for some unfathomable reason.Actually, thats a tiny bit unfair  as I said, Pile Up! screams family-friendly, so if youre looking to pick up a game to play with some younger kids and want to stretch the experience out, you can certainly do so here.For anyone else, though, Pile Up! is probably a game you can safely overlook. No matter how cute it may be, its not exactly fun to play, and at the end of the day, thats the most important thing.", "date": "October 1, 2021", "grade": "B-"}
