{"name": "Iron Snout", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/05/iron-snout-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Its important not to go into Iron Snout with anything in the way of expectations. It describes itself as a fighting game, which I suppose is true in the sense that its a game that does feature fighting. However, if youre expecting an actual fighting game in the traditional sense, in the vein of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, youll be sorely disappointed. After all, the entire game consists of a main character  a nameless pig  punching and kicking away wolves that come at you from either side of the screen.And thats it.There are no special moves to master. Theres nothing in the way of a story. You can chain together hits to build up combos, but they have no impact on the game beyond giving you a trophy once you reach 50 hits in a row. There are a couple of different environments in which to fight off the wolves, the enemies eventually get a little more frantic, and you can also play the game in one-hit sudden death mode, but at no time does the game every change.That said, if youre just after a quick, mindless diversion (and an easy Platinum), you could do worse than Iron Snout. You can control the pig with the D-pad, and theres something almost zen about flicking back and forth, kicking and punching away the wolves as they launch at you from either side. Its rarely particularly challenging, but its certainly fun for what it is.But again, what it is is not very much. I cant emphasize that enough. If you go into Iron Snout hoping for anything more than a quick time-waster, youll be sorely disappointed. If youre okay with that, then you might get your moneys worth here.", "date": "May 28, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
