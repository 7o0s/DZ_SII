{"name": "Snake Pass", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/04/snake-pass-review-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Mark it down now, 2017 is the year the platformer genre returned to its former glory. Snake Pass is here to kick off the revitalization of the genre for better or worse. A brand new IP from Sumo Digital which is quite refreshing, not just in being a new property but also in how the game plays. You control a snake (Noodle) with physics and movement mechanics that are something that havent been done before. Based off all of these attributes it seemed like Snake Pass could be a potential home run, but dont round the bases just yet.I wouldnt call Snake Pass a straight up platformer like Mario or Banjo Kazooie, but more of a puzzle platformer. Your goal throughout each level is to collect three different colored gem stones then proceed to the end of the stage. Collecting these gems can require doing many different things. From swimming, climbing bamboo chutes, pulling levers and more, theres a decent variety of ways these gems are scattered. Each stage also hides gold coins (which are the most hidden collectible) and blue orbs (which are the most frequent and easiest to find). So theres a good amount of items to collect in Snake Pass, the problem is that these items dont unlock anything, so I didnt have much of a desire to track any of them down, outside of the gems required to complete each level.Up until this point everything seems like a by the numbers platformer, but then theres how Noodle controls. You see, in order for Noodle to gain speed and momentum you must slither in a zig zag pattern (like a real snake). Holding the right trigger to move then using the analog stick to control your direction. You also have a button dedicated to lifting your head, which assists in climbing objects and the left trigger is used to hold tightly onto things. Thats really it as far as controls, and while that might not sound too bad, it does have a learning curve to break out of how your brain expects a platformer to play. The controls are true to how a snake would act but also to a fault. It becomes increasingly frustrating wrapping around ledges and trees and juggling the camera while youre trying to maneuver.", "date": "April 5, 2017", "grade": "C+"}
