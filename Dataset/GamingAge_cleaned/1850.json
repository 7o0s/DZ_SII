{"name": "Resogun", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/12/resogun-review-ps4/", "text": "So many games are releasing in a grey zone of console generations this year that its easy to wonder what besides visuals is separating them from each other. Is the audio fidelity better somehow? Does the hardware have a special pass that graces games with a better network connection over Xbox 360/PS3 games? Maybe one of them costs more than the other.Anyway. Heres another eye-searing game from Housemarque. Since its easy to confuse quality with visual fidelity when it comes to next-gen launch titles, were going to review Resogun the same way I played it with my eyes closed.Resogun isnt doing anything new on the PS4 outside of being an exclusive, but all the old things it decided to reincorporate are now fun again because nobody is making arcade games anymore or something. Carved out of a 2D-sidescrolling-shooter-shaped block of voxels, gamers patience is yet to be tested again by another vision of what would have happened if we never branched out from arcade-based games back in the 80s, along with Housemarques take on what will make it more interesting than the simple reward of blowing things up in great multitude.The twist on todays retro-inspired shooter is that each level has 10 humans to save, which basically serve as difficulty bait, since surviving a level is easy without any added challenge beyond enemy power. Held captive mostly by unique Keepers, destroying this select group of enemies frees a human from its gas chamber and puts you one step closer in a process that is either 2-100 steps longer depending on how easy the drop point is to safely navigate to.Die while transporting a human, the human dies. Dont destroy the keepers, human dead. All it lost? Human dies. Save the 9th human, retrieve the human, survive 30 waves of nearly death, throw the human in a dying breath to prevent one of the preceding from happening, human is stolen by a UFO, human dies. Trapped saving one human while two others have been freed? Humans probably will die. Inadvertently shoot human from a distance? Humans like to bounce into empty canyons and die.Humans are like the baby from Babys Day Out, and you end up feeling like three variations of Spike Lee trying to direct an Oldboy remake. And if it werent for Spike Lee, we wouldnt be challenged in any way to like his movies. Fortunately the challenge of saving all humans is not only self-imposed, but a rarely seen balance of risk/reward that Im not sure most games understand anymore.Aside from arbitrary goals and wave-based gameplay, the other thing people tend to pay attention to Resogun for are voxels. Were still waiting on scientists to get back to us about what those are.Resogun is small in scope, which means everything about it needs to have staying power. The gameplay certainly does, but the soundtrack is lukewarm. I would have also appreciated some form of local co-op, but I guess thats not something that exists anymore. On the other side of the coin, I will never tire of the announcer-through-controller for a rounding out of the arcade experience that metrics say 65% of our readers will have no idea what Im talking about at this point due to age. Its also pretty, but lets not be shallow about that. Its really pretty, though.I mean Id f*** it. But thats not for now.Were still not sure what voxels are, but apparently Resogun has them, and if theyre part of what makes this currently free PS+ game such a great coupling with the PS4, then they must be good for something. In that case, we should probably be putting voxels in every game just to make sure that theyre as fun and/or pretty as Resogun. Or tasty. Really not sure what voxels are.One thing is for sure this game is an exclusive to the PS4, and since its going to be slim-pickins for as long as all our hopes and dreams launch in two years, thats one upper hand that Sony can claim to house on their new thing.", "date": "December 2, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
