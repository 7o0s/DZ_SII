Apart from a brief nod to the coma at the absolute very end of the game, Dreaming Sarah is just weirdness after weirdness, with little in the way of obvious internal logic and nothing in the way of plot.I mean, if I were to describe my time with the game, it would sound like the unhinged rantings of a crazy person. First, I woke up in a meadow, then I walked until I found the abandoned elevator, which I took to the world full of eyes. I took the elevator back down, jumped off a cliff, and found myself under the sea, at which point I had to put on my magic medallion to turn myself into a fish. Good thing I was able to find the hidden toilet to flush myself into that doctors office! Also, the doctor was a purple duck. And its receptionist was a bleeding tooth.And this isnt a case of me exaggerating certain parts of Dreaming Sarah for comedic effect, and ignoring the otherwise straightforward nature of the game. Thats literally the whole game, albeit with a couple of parts left out that only wouldve added to the weirdness.Let me put it this way: you know how dreams are usually only interesting to the person having them? Dreaming Sarah is like that. Theres undoubtedly some fascinating ideas here that made a lot of sense to the developer, but as a game to play, it leaves a whole lot to be desired.", "date": "May 11, 2021", "grade": "C"}
