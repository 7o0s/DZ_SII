{"name": "Farming Simulator", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/farming-simulator-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Ive played Farming Simulator for more than a couple of hours now. Ive tilled my fields, sowed my seeds, and harvested my crops. Ive bought a fertilizer sprayer and harvester, and sold my corn and canola. Based on all that, I can make three statements about the game with varying degrees of confidence. First and foremost: I still dont really know what Im what Im doing. I mean, I have a vague idea. Through trial and error, Ive figured out what each machine does, and what steps I need to take for planting crops. Ive generally figured out how to navigate around the games map. But it took me quite awhile just to the very basic level that Im at now. This is because Farming Simulator is not exactly friendly to newcomers. In fact, its almost hostile to them. It gives the vaguest instructions possible, and then doesnt give you much of an idea how to carry them out. It expects you to wait around for crops to grow, and aside from a few side missions (all of which are The villagers have lost X. Will you help them find it?), it doesnt give any goals beyond building and sustaining a farm. Eventually (if youre anything like me) parts of the game fall into place, but it takes awhile. Once they do, though, the game is actually pretty fun. I know its easy to be skeptical of/amused by a game like Farming Simulator, since the whole concept seems almost antithetical to the very idea of video gaming, but once you actually play it (and, of course, get beyond the aforementioned learning curve), its shockingly addictive. Its not hard to get drawn into the simple rhythms of till-plant-harvest-sell-repeat, and before you know it youll probably find that youve sunk a couple of hours into the game without even realizing it.", "date": "July 12, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
