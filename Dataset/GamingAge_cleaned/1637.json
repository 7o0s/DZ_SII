After a long absence, almost a year as a matter of fact, Zen Studios has finally found itself on the Xbox One. Pinball FX2, like Zen Pinball 2, provides fans with not only the best pinball experience out there, but thanks to the nifty (albeit not complete as of this writing) import feature, most of the tables you played and loved on the Xbox 360 are now playable on your Xbox One. Whats more, thanks to the power of the system, Pinball FX2 looks and performs better than ever before.While the overall Pinball FX2 experience is honestly just an enhanced version of what you knew and played on the Xbox 360, the new interface now makes things more manageable  giving gamers their own say on what tables are the best for their finger flipping prowess. This is all thanks to a new panel system that not only breaks down tables into their own genres, but a new release panel which allows gamers to view what is new and hot in the pinball world. This new feature became evident when Guardians of the Galaxy and The Walking Dead tables were released, both of which are new and pretty darn fantastic if I am to be so bold.Whats also great is that the same tournaments and achievements (even though you need to earn them again) are back. Sadly, while you can import your old tables, you must earn those high scores and leaderboard bragging rights one more time. While I am happy the import system exists (and who wouldnt be) the process of doing so is basically going through the buying process all over again, even though you dont have to pay for it a second time. Lastly I most note that there are a few tables that are oddly missing at the time of this writing, even if you owned them on the 360. These include Earth Defense, Excalibur, Marvel Pinball Origins, Street Fighter II, Plants vs. Zombies, and Super League Football. While Im not sure if they are absent due to licensing, technical issues or just plain forgetfulness, the fact that they are not there is quite curious indeed, and without answer at the time of this writing.", "date": "September 19, 2014", "grade": "A"}
