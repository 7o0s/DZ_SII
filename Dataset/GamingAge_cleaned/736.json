Madden saw a strong start to EA Sports biggest time of the year and well see how FIFA and the returning NBA Live do later this month, but now its time to talk some hockey. In what was mostly a marginal improvement last year, Im happy to report while that statement still applies to NHL 18 with many aspects of the game, EA also took the time and effort to implement a brand new mode into NHL 18. A lot of what I wrote about in NHL 17 (here) still applies and Im not going to rehash that stuff so feel free to go back to that review if you havent read it or youre returning to the NHL franchise for the first time in bit.Lets get right to the main event of NHL 18; NHL Threes. Threes is the brand new, over-the-top, arcade style mode added to NHL 18. As you might be able to tell from the name of the mode, gameplay shifts from the traditional 5-on-5 to 3-on-3. Threes is reminiscent of old arcade style games like NHL Hitz and Wayne Gretzky Hockey; penalties are put on the bench, theres an over-the-top (repetitive) announcer, and they have specialty game altering pucks. Threes is treated much like the Longshot mode in this years Madden; it feels like a completely independent game with its own menu. You can pick between playing pick-up matches or playing through the campaign, which has you go through circuits of different teams. Based on my knowledge of gaming history and a bit of EAs history Im kinda shocked that they decided to include this in NHL 18. Threes could easily stand alone as a downloadable release and many publishers probably would have done that, so I really applaud EA for including it for no extra cost.Threes rules are customizable so you can play a set period length or to a certain score. Playing to a certain score is the way to go, in my opinion, because of the specialty or money puck option. You see, when you play through games in Threes, as you score there will be a bar that tells which type of puck will be used next, and after each score they change. The Fire puck will give you up to 3 goals, while the Ice puck will give you a goal and take one goal away from your opponent. I could go without the repetitive announcer, but it is nostalgic to the arcade announcers of the 90s sports titles. Minor gripes aside, Threes is a new mode everyone should check out.Another new feature to NHL 18 is the ability to do an expansion draft in Franchise mode. Not only can you take over the brand new Vegas franchise, Golden Knights, but you can also create the NHLs 32nd team and whatever you want to call it. Creating your own team means; choosing a city, building an arena, designing a jersey, logo, and even mascot all before the players you draft take the ice. As I said in last years NHL review, Im not a huge hockey fan, but I do enjoy the sport, so this expansion option was perfect for me. I could draft recognizable players and build the type of team I like, while also customizing everything else regarding the team.Thats really it for the new stuff (theres a training mode, but thats hardly a selling point), so EAs sticking with the if its not broke dont fix it mantra that they typically use with their sports titles. The TV-style presentation is still some of the best of any sports game and I am baffled as to why they dont put in the same effort with their other releases, especially Madden. I also really like how many options were given for controls, difficulty, and rules. These arent anything new to the series but they stand out when you play other sports titles and they lack the level of customization that NHL 18 has.", "date": "September 17, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
