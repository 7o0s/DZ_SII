Not just Vita GOTY, but GOTY for everything. I mean, just look at those screenshots. The developers of htoL#NiQ (which is apparently a stylized way of writing out the games Japanese name, Hotaru No Nikki) created an absolutely stunning world. Its dark, its mysterious, its creepy; if youre looking for a richly-imagined setting for a game about a girl with no memories and who relies on shadows and light to guide her, its pretty much perfect in that respect.Unfortunately, thats the only way in which htoL#NiQ could be described as perfect. To be blunt, this is a seriously boring game. I wouldnt say theres nothing to do, because that would be a bit of a stretchbut really, theres not a lot going on here. This is a game where you spend the vast majority of the time simply pressing your finger on one side of the screen, guiding the little girl across platforms. Theres the odd moment when youre running from monsters, or where you have to tap on the rear touchscreen in order to activate the shadow world and trigger some event, but those are rare. For the most part, its all just waiting around for the girl to get from Point A to Point B.I suspect that a big part of the games incredible dullness stems from the fact its controls are touchscreen-only. I understand that the developers were trying to take advantage of the Vitas unique control inputs, and I respect their effort in doing so, but that doesnt make the final product any less boring. Its not as if the game would be substantially more interesting or engaging if you were using more traditional control methods, but it would definitely be better than this.(EDIT: Thanks to a helpful commenter, I realized htoL#NiQ does, in fact, have an analog control option. Its hidden away by an oddly-designed UI on the Options page, but it is definitely there. Thats the good news.The bad? Somewhat surprisingly, it actually doesnt make htoL#NiQ any better. Youre still guiding the little girl across the screen, just with a faster-moving firefly, which means you probably spend more time waiting around for things to happen. Not only that, it makes the puzzles significantly easier  which is no small achievement, considering they were generally pretty easy to begin with. Its nice, I guess, that the analog controls allow you to see the lovely screens without having your finger in the way, but Id trade a bit of that loveliness for a more interesting game in a heartbeat.) It also doesnt help matters that the accompanying score is so minimalist. Admittedly, this complaint comes down more to aesthetic preferences than something thats definitely, objectively wrong with the game, but as far as Im concerned, the decision to accompany long stretches of nothing to do with little-to-no music or sound makes the whole thing even more tedious. (That said, I think my opinion here is coloured by the bland gameplay. If htoL#NiQ were a more engaging game, I could totally see a situation where the minimalist score were a point in its favor.)", "date": "February 23, 2015", "grade": "C+"}
