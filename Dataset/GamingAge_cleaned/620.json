Here goes:School Girl/Zombie Hunter is an incredibly stupid game.Okay, thats not that shocking. Or shocking at all. Really, if you were expecting a game called School Girl/Zombie Hunter to be anything but schlocky, B-movie-level trash, then thats on you.But, I hear you say, what about Lollipop Chainsaw? That game sounded trashy, but it was actually surprisingly smart! And while thats a fair point, it overlooks a few key factors. First, Lollipop Chainsaw was written by James Gunn and created by Suda51, which means that there was some pretty impressive talent behind it. School Girl/Zombie Hunter, by contrast, was made by the people behind games like Drive Girls, Onechanbara, and Senran Kagurua, all of which exist primarily to show how far jiggle physics gaming technology has come. Secondly, School Girl/Zombie Hunter is made for the kind of people who looked at Lollipop Chainsaw and were disappointed that you didnt get to see the games heroine stripped down to her undies. In fact, School Girl/Zombie Hunter is made for the kind of people wholl buy DLC that changes the undies into vegetables that (barely) cover up the eponymous school girls nether regions.In other words, as I said before, School Girl/Zombie Hunter is a stupid, stupid game. But provided you can shut your brain off and appreciate it the same way you would, say, some Z-grade schlockfest from the 70s, its not wholly unenjoyable. I mean, you have to be willing to make allowances for extremely repetitive gameplay and middling graphics. Every level can basically be summarized as Kill all the zombies until the time runs out, and even if the game gives you a decent array of weapons with which to achieve that goal, they dont differ from each other all that much. Zombies just kind of pop into existence in front of you, meaning you spend all your time just spamming the shooting button  which, truthfully, isnt that bad a thing to be doing, since it distracts you from the ugly-looking environments. Id say that the story or the characters make up for those downsidesbut if youve read this far, you shouldnt be surprised to learn that both of those things are lacking, too.But Id be lying if I said that I totally hated it. Sure, I could only bring myself to play School Girl/Zombie Hunter in small doses, and as I was playing all I could think about was how stupid the game was. But if you want mindless action that you wont have to think about very deeply  and that you probably shouldnt think about too deeply, for your own mental well-being  then this game will deliver that in spades.", "date": "January 12, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
