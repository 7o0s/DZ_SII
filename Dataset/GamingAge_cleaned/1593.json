{"name": "Samurai Warriors 4", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/11/samurai-warriors-4-review-ps-vita-ps4-ps3/", "text": "Your opinion on Samurai Warriors 4  at least on the Vita  will be dictated entirely by your feelings on draw distances.Now, before I go any further, I just want to acknowledge how pretentious that previous sentence is, and how its never something I thought Id find myself writing. After all, most of the time, I dont care about that kind of stuff  as far as Im concerned, as long as the game doesnt crash on start-up and isnt eye-bleedingly hideous, Im good.For Samurai Warriors 4, though, draw distance is actually a big deal. After all, the Warriors series in general  be it Samurai Warriors, Dynasty Warriors, One Piece Pirate Warriors, whatever  is all about hacking and slashing your way through hundreds, if not thousands, of enemies. There are obviously stabs (pardon the unintentional pun) at a story, but those have generally been secondary to mowing down wave after wave of bad guys.Whats notable about Samurai Warriors 4 on the Vita isnt that the gameplay has changed all that much  its basically identical to every other entry in the series  but rather, that it doesnt try to show those waves upon waves. Youll see them on your map, and they show up the moment youve flown through the preceding wave and moved one step in any direction, but when youre actually focused on one set of enemies, thats all you focus on for that moment.While this will probably annoy some people  the sort of people who care about pop-in and draw distance and all that  I have to think its a good move. As someone who has suffered through some pretty terrible graphics on previous Warriors games on the Vita, I welcome this concession to the smaller screen and less powerful hardware (at least compared to the PS4). It looks a lot nicer, it makes the screen a lot less cluttered, and it makes it possible to enjoy the game without fighting against lousy graphics (which, to me at least, was one of the big problems of some of the more recent Warriors games on the Vita).", "date": "November 4, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
