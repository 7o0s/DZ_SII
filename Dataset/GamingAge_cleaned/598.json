{"name": "Dynasty Warriors 9", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/02/dynasty-warriors-9-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "In one way, Dynasty Warriors 9 represents a huge step forward for the series. Gone are the discrete maps that marked each new level, replaced by a massive open world for you to explore and conquer. Theres also a stealth feature this time outbut lets be honest, if youre playing Dynasty Warriors 9  or if youre playing any other Warriors musou game, for that matter  youre probably not playing because you want to skulk around in the shadows. Youre here because you want to hack and slash your way through thousands of enemies (and, possibly, learn about a skewed version of Chinese history, but Im assuming thats secondary for most people).The good news is that, even with the changes, you can still hack and slash your way through thousands of enemies. Whether youre battling your way through a castle or youve stumbled across one of the many, many enemy camps scattered around the map, you can hack and slash to your hearts content. There are minor changes here and there as far as combos and boosts go, but, at its core, the game isnt all that different from its predecessors.Thats not entirely a good thing, mind you. Warriors games have always struggled with draw distances, and that issue is on full display here. Its not uncommon for swarms of enemies to only appear at the very last second, when youre almost literally right on top of them. In fact, if anything, the open world has only magnified the problem, since everywhere you turn, you can see the horizon popping onto the screen in the distance. In some ways, this makes navigation kind of difficult, since it makes it hard to tell what obstacles will be in your way in any given directionthough at the same time, I was able to ride my horse across a lake, so its not like environmental obstacles really impede your movement that much.This isnt the only problem thats magnified by the open world, either. In fact, the open world also magnifies the whole franchises biggest problem: that its a little (okay, a lot) repetitive. Its easy to overlook that fact when youre going through the game one castle or battlefield at a time. When youve got a huge map where thats all you do, with only sidequests (that, truth be told, arent all that different from the main quests), its easy for things to get boring kind of quickly.Yet, even with these flaws, its hard to say that Dynasty Warriors 9 isnt worth checking out, at least if youre a fan of any of the Warriors games. Its neat to see the franchise trying something new, even if it doesnt totally succeed. More importantly, none of the new stuff takes away from what makes Warriors games fun in the first place: you still get to single-handedly mow down enemy army after enemy army. No matter what else may have changed, that core fact remains the same in Dynasty Warriors 9  and as long as thats true, thats really all that matters.", "date": "February 13, 2018", "grade": "B"}
