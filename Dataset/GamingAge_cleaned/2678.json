Strategy! Quests! Resource management!Heres what you actually get out of it, though: a bland clicker game that holds your hand through every one of its mercifully-short eight chapters.I mean, there are worse things to be. In a lot of ways, The Unexpected Quest looks and feels like one of those rip-off mobile games thats constantly badgering you to pay real money to unlock more of the game. That its not probably counts as a minor victory. You only have to pay for the game once  though seeing as were talking about $15 for a game that feels like it should be a buck or two, Ill leave it to you to decide whether that constitutes great value.Unfortunately, not being a freemium/pay-to-win game doesnt really count for all that much in the big scheme of things. Ideally, a game will offer something a little more interesting than gameplay that consists entirely of clicking on objects like gold, lumber, and food, using them to build more buildings, and then waiting for more gold, lumber, and food to continue the cycle. Occasionally youll venture into battlebut again, that consists of clicking on the monster, and waiting for your soldier to do their thing, earning you (say it with me) gold, lumber and food. As gameplay loops go, its not particularly fun or rewarding.And if its not fun or rewarding it, why bother playing it? While Ive certainly played worse clicker games, that doesnt make The Unexpected Quest significantly better, and it really doesnt mean that you need to waste your time with it.", "date": "April 20, 2021", "grade": "D+"}
