{"name": "Dragon Sinker", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/05/dragon-sinker-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "By now, you should know what youre getting when you see a game from Kemco on your platform of choice: a generic, competently-made JRPG. Occasionally youll stumble across one thats slightly above average, but that should be considered a nice bonus, rather than something on which you can count.On this very narrow scale of entirely average to slightly above average, Dragon Sinker probably falls a little closer to the slightly above average end. For the most part, its everything youd expect it to be: retro graphics, a 2D map, turn-based combat, and so on. Basically, it mostly acts as if video games stopped evolving somewhere around 1991 or so.That said, I do appreciate its approach to team-based combat. Dragon Sinker features a lot of characters, and it expects you to juggle all of them as you progress through its world. To make this easier, the game gives you three squads to work with, and you can swap them in and out of battles at will as you progress. Further, the characters all earn XP and automatically level up following battles, making it easier to ensure that the dozen or so characters at your disposal are all accruing benefits from the frequent battles scattered all over the map.To be clear, I wouldnt say that Dragon Sinker is going to blow you away or anything. You should go into it expecting a mostly-generic JRPG, just as you would any other Kemco game. But, like the better JRPGs from that studio, that tiny bit of game that isnt generic is enough to ensure that JRPG fans looking for their next fix may want to consider it if the price is right.", "date": "May 3, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
