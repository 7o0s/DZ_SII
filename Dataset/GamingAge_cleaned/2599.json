{"name": "Maneater", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/07/maneater-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Ive always liked the idea of Maneater a lot more than the actual game. That was the case when I got it on Xbox back when it first came out: I loved the concept, found the game boring. When it came to PS+ back in January: still loved the premise, still found the game boring. And now that its arrived on the Switch? You guessed it: I still love everything about the game, save for the actual gameplay.I genuinely want to like this game a lot more than I do. I wish I could praise it as much as my colleague Stan did for the PC release last year.The thing is, the gameplay is just so boring. Pretty much every single mission consists of swimming to an area, eating a certain number of a specific type of fish (and sometimes humans), and then waiting for the area bosses to show up. Obviously, given that were talking about a real underwater creature, its not like the developers could have given your killer shark some insane, out-of-this-world powers  though at the same time, given the inventiveness on display elsewhere in the game, its kind of unfortunate that they didnt.After all, all your shark can really do is bite, hit enemies with its tail, and sometimes combine the two together so that you bite then hit with your tail. Itskind of underwhelming, and it gets very repetitively very, very quickly. Occasionally the game forces your shark to flop around on dry land eating people, but that only serves to make Maneaters combat shortcomings even more evident, since thats when it goes from being merely repetitive to repetitive with awkward controls.And again, its really unfortunate that the game falls apart the way it does, because when you look beyond the core gameplay, you can tell the developers really, really loved coming up with everything in Maneater. Its the story of a shark out to avenge its mothers murder at the hands of a reality show cretin and his son, narrated by the inimitable Chris Parnell. Whether its some goofy cutscene or Parnell narrating some insane nonsense, its in those moments where the game transcends its lousy action and becomes something fun and original.Most of the time, though, Maneater feels like a game where they spent all their creativity coming up with the premise. Dont get me wrong: its a wonderfully goofy premise, and the fact I keep giving this game so many chances shows how easy it is to love. The unfortunate truth, though, is that no matter how much fun the idea of being an unstoppable killer shark may be, the reality  at least in Maneater  leaves a lot to be desired.", "date": "July 19, 2021", "grade": "C+"}
