{"name": "Cyber Protocol", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/01/cyber-protocol-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Maybe its just me, but I feel like the easiest way to describe Cyber Protocol is Pac-Man, but as a puzzle game. While thats missing some nuance, as a general way to describe the game, I really cant think of a better high-level description.I mean, look at those screenshots. Youve got a maze, youve got little pellets to pick up, youve got the whole neon-lit 80s aesthetic. Really, all thats missing is music that goes waka waka waka.Of course, is Pac-Man sounds were the score to Cyber Protocol, itd be a huge downgrade from whats here. The music is definitely 80s-influenced with its heavy doses of synth, but the overall production feels undeniably modern. Its one of the best-sounding games Ive heard in a long time, and the fact you can switch over to the music player and simply enjoy the soundtrack is a huge plus in the games favour.A huge minus? The fact the game gets really repetitive, really quickly. In this respect  and I realize Im going to lose a lot of people here  the game really reminds me of Pac-Man. Any time I play that classic (and Ive played it many, many times over the years), Ill always play for a little bit, and then get bored and quit. So it is, too, with Cyber Protocol. While theres plenty of variation to be found in the level layouts, you still cant shake the feeling that youre doing the same level over and over again. It doesnt help matters much that the checkpoints in some of these levels are few and far between, and you die pretty quickly, so its not uncommon to do the same segments more than a dozen times before you finally get the timing and the pattern down right.", "date": "January 30, 2020", "grade": "B"}
