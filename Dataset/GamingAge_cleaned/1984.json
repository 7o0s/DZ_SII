{"name": "Coconut Dodge Revitalised", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/07/coconut-dodge-revitalised-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Coming as it does after FuturLabs first full-fledged Vita game, Velocity Ultra, Coconut Dodge Revitalised feels like a bit of a letdown. After all, where that previous game is one of the best Sonys handheld has to offer, this one feels more like a mobile gaming refugee, the sort of thing you might expect to find in Apples App Store or the Google Play store. You play as a crab, dodging falling coconuts and collecting falling treasure andwell, thats about it. Theres no story, no changing up gameplay: you just want to last as long as you can in the hopes of besting your previous high score.Of course, comparing Coconut Dodge Revitalised to Velocity Ultra is totally unfair on my part, and not just because most games will come out badly when compared to Velocity Ultra. No, what makes the comparison unfair is that Coconut Dodge clearly aims to occupy a very different niche. If Im going to compare the game to anything, it should be to stuff like Jetpack Joyride, or Flying Hamster HD, or Mens Room Mayhem  in other words, to the other mobile-style games already on the Vita.And on that front, the game isstill not that great, to be honest. Even by the (arguably lower) standards of mobile games, Coconut Dodge Revitalised feels a little insubstantial. Play it once, and youve basically gotten a taste of everything the game has to offer. Yes, there are a couple of different modes available  one makes the coconuts fall in a maze pattern, another asks you to keep a bouncing ball in the air  but none of them alter the basic formula all that much.", "date": "July 22, 2013", "grade": "C"}
