Within the broader context of Lightwood Games releases, its roughly adjacent to Word Sudoku, in that its name may make you think its a word game, but within moments of starting to play it, youll realize its actually a puzzle game.Theres a key difference between Tic-Tac-Letters and Word Sudoku, though. Whereas the latter followed the rules of sudoku (with nine-letter words replacing the numbers 1 through 9), Tic-Tac-Letters is more tic-tac-toe-adjacent than a straight-up extension of the game. Its single-player, for starters, so theres no strategizing against other players. For another, the board is much bigger than your standard 33 grid  the smallest grid here starts at 66, and it only gets bigger the harder the puzzles get.The biggest difference, though, is that the object of Tic-Tac-Letters is to lay out pairs of letters so that you never have a row or column where you have more than two of the same letter next to each other horizontally or vertically. Unlike tic-tac-toe, the diagonal doesnt matter here.While it all makes for a solid time-waster, Id be lying if I said that I found it as fun or as engaging as I have most other Lightwood releases. While theres a bit of a challenge early on in the smaller puzzles, by the time youve worked your way up to the harder ones, youve seen all there is to see in the game. Whats more, in the larger puzzles its really more a matter of trial and error than actual puzzle-solving, and youll quickly find that youll be using the Check button to see if youre on the right track much more often than youll be figuring anything out.Im not saying its not worth a buy, mind you. As someone whos become thoroughly addicted to every game Lightwood have put out in the last couple of years, Im going to faithfully plow through Tic-Tac-Letters, just like I did for the likes of Wordsweeper and One Word. But I will say that unless you share in my unhealthy obsession, youre probably safe to skip this one.", "date": "November 15, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
