{"name": "The Pinball Wizard", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/12/the-pinball-wizard-review-for-switch-pc/", "text": "The Pinball Wizard is one of those games that are based on really interesting ideas, but that are more interesting as a concept than as a game.In this case, were talking about a game that mixes together pinball with dungeon-crawling. Youre tasked with guiding your character through a series of dungeons, with each dungeon leading you further up a tower. The twist  and where the game gets its name  is that each new dungeon is also a new pinball table, complete with a set of flippers at the bottom of the room. If you fall through the flippers, you lose a little bit of health, and if you lose enough health, its game over. You proceed to the next dungeon/level/table by killing the monster that holds the key to unlock the door to the next room. As I said, its a neat idea, but the execution leaves a little something to be desired. The levels mostly all feel the same, with the same visuals for each dungeon. Its cute to look at, but by the 10th or 11th dungeon without much in the way of variation, it starts feeling like youre just playing the same table over and over again.The bigger issue, though, is that the gameplay isnt all that fun. Since you dont directly control your character  again, you flick them around using your pinball paddles  it can often feel like youre just bouncing around each table, hoping you get a lucky bounce that helps you defeat the monsters, pick up the key, and exit to the next level. Admittedly, my pinball skills have always been a little lacking, but I also never felt like The Pinball Wizard offers you the kind of precision you get in proper pinball games.Which, ultimately, is why The Pinball Wizard doesnt live up to its intriguing premise. In setting out to combine two very different genres, it put itself in a situation where it had to be both a solid pinball game and a decent dungeon crawler. Instead, its only so-so at both halves of that equation, which makes it difficult to recommend.", "date": "December 21, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
