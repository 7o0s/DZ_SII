She is a character Ive certainly grown attached to over the years, thanks in large part to the excellent group of writers that have fleshed out her character over the past seasons. Im also hedging my bets against the conclusion being a happy one, after all, this is The Walking Dead were talking about. With that, this first episode of the final season certainly paints a pretty bleak picture of hunger, desolation, and general hopelessness that will certainly make you feel a little uneasy throughout.As someone who has been an avid reader of Robert Kirkmans comic for a number of years, I like that this season of Telltales The Walking Dead managed to come up with something new regarding the setting. Clementine will match up with a group of survivors within her own age range, in a settlement devoid of adults. Its not automatically a Lord of the Flies situation either, but instead youve got this rag tag group of teenage and children survivors that pair up pretty well with Clementine and her young ward A.J.A.J. also proves to be an interesting addition right out of the gate. Previously he was little more than a baby when first introduced, but we now get to see him a bit older as Clementine attempts to be a parent to A.J. in the same fashion Lee was to her. Shes not always great at it, and A.J.s fairly limited and horrific exposure to the world hes grown up in has left him a little unpredictable. While seemingly capable with a weapon, he is still very much a child, prone to fits of anger that even he doesnt fully understand. I found the connection between him and Clementine to be both charming and a tad bit unnerving, especially as you see the choices you make begin to affect his personality.While most of this episode takes place in one central location, youll still get some limited exploration and combat elements that weve seen before in other seasons. The combat here is a little more involved, one sequence will have you facing off against multiple zombies using traps and the ability to disable a zombie before killing it as a way of surviving. This sequence in particular can actually be a little tough if youre just mindlessly marching forward. I had to back up, circle around the group, and occasionally put a little distance between my targets to prevent myself from getting overwhelmed. It certainly felt more involved than any of the previous combat sequences in The Walking Dead thus far.Id say that this episode is a pretty great start to the finale of the series for Telltale. Its been a long, and occasionally bumpy road, but this seems to be shaping up extremely well early on. The cliffhanger for this episode has me anxious to see what happens next, and the new cast of characters are more appealing than most of the hardened jerks that populated The New Frontier. Itll be interesting to see where things go from here, but again, Im not holding my breath for a happy ending.", "date": "August 13, 2018", "grade": "A"}
