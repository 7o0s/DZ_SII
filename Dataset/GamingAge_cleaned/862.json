And we can all agree on that? No? Ugh.Fine!Really though, Persona 5 IS pretty damn great. Ive enjoyed the series since Persona 3, like a lot of other people I assume, and everything about Persona 5 manages to enhance everything preceding it. The core concepts are still the same. Youth rebelling, high-school drama, awesome and strangely designed monsters, and a whole lot of dungeon crawling. But Persona 5 does introduce a hefty number of new mechanics, like the standalone Palace dungeons, a stealth mechanic that actually works, and a varied dungeon design with unique and weird themes that fit the story.I dont think it is worth spoiling much of the game here, after all its been out for a little bit, and people are either in the middle of it, or just now playing it. But I will say that Ive really enjoyed the story, honestly more so than I ever did Persona 4. The game may not have as memorable a cast as P4, but it picks up and gets moving at a much quicker pace, and doesnt have a lot of dull moments in between. Most of the voiceover work is solid, and the music is absolutely fantastic, fitting the game world perfectly.And while this may come as no surprise, the game just oozes style. Theres so much stuff crammed in here, even in simple menus, that Im constantly picking out little details that Ive previously missed. Persona 5 has a real unique look to it, and all of it feels remarkably cohesive and downright elegant in execution. Its also just really fun to play. You still have the standard day to day planning mechanics of the last two Persona games. Youll generally be presented with some sort of time limit with which to complete the story dungeons, and in between you can spend time strengthening your bonds with both teammates and other denizens youll encounter. You can also spend time working for cash, or engage in a variety of activities to boost your core attributes, which in turn will affect your ability to create new bonds, succeed during exam times, and so on. When its time to enter a Palace, or the ever-present Mementos dungeon, thats where the game really kicks into high gear. Like previous games, youll explore a series of floors that are filled with shadows, which represent the enemies youll do battle with. Striking a shadow before it notices you allows you to ambush them, meaning youll be able to take a full turn before the enemy does. However, in Persona 5, the way you approach these shadows is a little different. Now you can hide behind objects, and dash between nearby objects, in order to creep up on an unsuspecting shadow from cover. Its certainly far more efficient and fun than the approach previous Persona titles have taken.Dungeons can also host a series of other hazards and obstacles. Youll encounter security cameras, various puzzles, and even alert states if you get spotted by too many Shadows while exploring. This in turn can make the dungeon much tougher for you, and can generally only be reduced by successfully defeating other Shadows that youve managed to sneak up on. This isnt to say that the stealth mechanics are hard or cumbersome here, they arent, but they do add another of depth to the exploration aspect in Persona 5. The rest of Persona 5 isnt too different from the previous entries. There is still a big focus on collecting various Persona to use in combat, and combat revolves almost entirely around finding the weakness of the enemy youre fighting, and exploiting that weakness to gain extra turns. Combat can still be pretty challenging at times, youll definitely encounter bosses and other enemies that seem to possess zero weaknesses, but these tougher encounters never feel unfair. Most boss fights have some sort of unique mechanic to them as well, which is always interesting to see play out.", "date": "April 18, 2017", "grade": "A+"}
