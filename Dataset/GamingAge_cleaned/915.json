{"name": "Space Overlords", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/01/space-overlords-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "For about five minutes, Space Overlords seems like it could be a decent game. It puts you down on a planet as some type of robot god, and gives you power to destroy every single thing on that planet. If youve ever played the EDF series and wished you could play as the bad guys, for a brief moment it seems like this game will grant those wishes.Then the game drives straight into a wall, and everything immediately starts sucking.I probably shouldve taken it as a warning sign that to get to those aforementioned few minutes, I had to spend at least as much time  if not significantly more  looking at loading screens. You start up Space Overlordsand you wait. You pick a robotand you wait. You pick a leveland you waitand then it shows a different screenand you wait some moreand then it shows one last screenon which you wait a moment before getting to play the game. Basically, any time you want to do anything in this game (at least in the Vita version  the PS4 version doesnt suffer from quite the same issues), you need to be prepared to wait for several minutes.Initially it seems the payoff to waiting might be almost worth it. Its giant robots smashing buildings; thats basically my definition of a fun game! The thing is, it quickly becomes apparent that the buildings arent very big, theres no feedback telling you how hard youre hitting them, and the smashing gets old pretty fast. The robot movements are slow and clunky, their attacks are weak, and theyre incredibly unresponsive to everything you want them to do. Theres also the fact theres no rhyme or reason to how quickly enemy attacks drain your health.And, to top it all off, the landscapes are bland and interchangeable, and outside of those final loading screens, so too are the robots.", "date": "January 26, 2017", "grade": "D"}
