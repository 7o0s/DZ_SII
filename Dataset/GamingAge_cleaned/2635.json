{"name": "Kirbys Return to Dream Land Deluxe", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/03/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-deluxe-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Heres my experience of Kirbys Return to Dream Land Deluxe in a nutshell: as I was playing through the first level, I paused the game and went to the Switchs main menu just to double-check I hadnt accidentally downloaded and started playing Kirby Star Allies. In retrospect, of course, the lack of, you know, allies shouldve been a dead giveaway, but for that brief moment when I started the game, I couldve sworn Id already played it. Mind you, in a sense, I had already played it  about a dozen years ago, back when the game was originally released on the Wii. But if Im being honest, I dont remember much about that game, whereas I do remember Star Allies, so thats where my mind immediately went. However you want to look at it, though, thats the general feeling of Kirbys Return to Dream Land Deluxe: its familiar. Its comforting. Its a straightforward Kirby 2D platformer, without any of the bells and whistles youd find in, say, Kirbys Epic Yarn, let alone Kirby and the Forgotten Land.Thats not to say its a bad game, of course  not by any stretch of the imagination. Its an easy one, to be sure, as weve come to expect from Kirby, but its still fun. Its really enjoyable to use all the powers he has at his disposal, from throwing bombs and wielding swords, to sloshing his enemies with water and shooting fireballs. Return to Dream Land Deluxe also brings over a pair of abilities from Star Allies, Mecha and Sandand yes, Kirby in a mech suit firing rockets and lasers is every bit as great as it sounds. On top of those regular abilities, Kirby also has access to Super Abilities that allow him to do things like turn into a giant ball of snow, shoot fiery dragons across the screen, and slash through the world with a giant sword. If they were available the entire game, of course, theyd be game-breaking, but theyre available sparingly enough here that when they make an appearance, its a blast.As for the levels, theyre about what youd expect  the usual mix of different environments that youd get in any platformer worth its salt. None of them represent a huge departure from your standard Kirby levels, which, depending on your perspective, either underlines how much of a comfort food-style game this is, or how comparatively little effort seems to go into creating the series 2D worlds. (Personally, I fall more in the former camp, but I can see why some may fall into the latter.)Of course, given that Return to Dream Land Deluxe is a remake, the bigger question about the game isnt How does it compare to previous Kirby games?, since we already know that  but, rather, What new stuff does the game bring to the table compared to the original? And on that front, the game delivers. For one thing, you get access to a minigame collection, Merry Magoland, which is kind of appropriate given that the game originated on the Wii. While none of the minigames are the sort of thing that youd want to play instead of the base game, its still enjoyable to take a break from the platforming in favour of short multiplayer fun. You can play games like Tome Trackers, which is like how Smash Bros. would be if you were vying with other characters to grab books, or Booming Blasters, where you get to try to blast away other competitors with bombs, Crackity Hack, where youre competing to see who can drive a hole the furthest down into the ground. Again, theyre hardly essential (and 8 of the 11 minigames have appeared in previous Kirby games), but they add to the multiplayer fun.Further, once you finish the main game theres a new series of levels called the Magolor Epilogue: The Interdimensional Traveler, where you get to play as, obviously, Magolor. While it feels similar to Kirby, the big difference is that youre helping Magolor regain lost powers, rather than him having access to all the powers from the get-go. Its not a long game, and it can be played with up to four players, but it adds an interesting wrinkle to the usual Kirby formula. But its not a huge departure  which is kind of the point of Kirbys Return to Dream Land Deluxe. As I wrote above, its pretty much what youd expect from a 2D Kirby game  but seeing as the baseline for those is cute platformer that wont tax you too much and that you can play with pretty much anyone, thats hardly a bad thing. Add in a few new elements, and you have the ingredients for a pretty solid remake.", "date": "March 2, 2023", "grade": "A-"}
