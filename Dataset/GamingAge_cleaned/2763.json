{"name": "Double Pug Switch", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/01/double-pug-switch-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Double Pug Switch shows how far cuteness can take a game.Without its pug protagonists, it wouldnt be anything too special  just an auto-running platformer that requires some pretty solid twitch reflexes as you flip back and forth between dimensions and avoid the many, many obstacles in every level. If anything, the game might stand out for its insane level of difficulty, but that wouldnt be a sure thing.Factor in the adorableness of the titular pug(s), however, and suddenly Double Pug Switch has more of a personality. I mean, every time you die, you have to see the pugs sad face. He looks so disappointed in you! The game also does a good job of tying the pug into the plot, as its been not only dumped into an alternate dimension because of a mischievous cat, but also split into two dimensions (hence the switching), and you need to retrieve the cat in order to finish the game. Thats a better plot explanation than most games give you, and it ties everything together well.But dont let that adorableness fool you: this is, as I said, an insanely hard game. The combination of auto-running, obstacles that instantly kill you, and needing to switch back and forth constantly means that death is a frequently-occuring constant in every level. Youll need to claw your way to each checkpoint, memorizing every new obstacle and spike and hole that you come across so you can make it just a little further in each level with every run. Thankfully the levels are kind of short, so you never spend too much time doing the same segments over and over again, but youll still be doing a lot of do-overs in every single level.In other words, as cute as the pug  and the game  may look, dont be sucked into Double Pug Switch if youre looking for a family-friendly platformer to play with kids. This game is as challenging as they come, so only pick it up if youre in the mood to die a whole bunch.", "date": "January 12, 2021", "grade": "B"}
