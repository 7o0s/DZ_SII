{"name": "LEGO The Hobbit", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/04/lego-hobbit-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Considering the sheer number of LEGO titles that developer Travelers Tales has created at this point, I think its safe to say that you have some idea of whether youll enjoy a LEGO themed game or not. Thats not to say that theyre all good or bad. Ive seen the quality dip and rise with different releases, but by and large have found most entries to be pretty enjoyable. The last slew of titles, ending with the most recent LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, has certainly been of a higher calibre. LEGO The Hobbit does little to change that line of thought.Like previous games in the series, youll take a cast of characters drawn from the source material across a number of action-themed stages. While the trilogy has yet to be finished in film form, this game focuses solely on a portion of the story ending with the Desolation of Smaug. I think its a bit early to pull the trigger on a LEGO release of the game for that reason alone, but I imagine theres some marketing desire to get this title on shelves in time for the DVD/Blu-ray release of the second film that Ill never really understand. That said, outside of some audio quibbles, the game doesnt suffer in quality by being rushed to market.As previous LEGO titles have managed to do, LEGO The Hobbit presents its tale via cutscenes representing minifig versions of film characters, often with a humorous spin. It does feature voice acting, an addition to the formula that began with LEGO Batman 2. With the game being culled from a film adaptation, the voice acting adopts a lot of sound bites and moments from the films. Sometimes this works to the detriment of the sound quality, with very obvious, oftentimes hollow renditions of film moments being shoved into the LEGO acting displayed on screen. This becomes more noticeable when compared to the original dialogue delivered by characters, often quest givers, found within the LEGO world of Middle-Earth.The action bits of LEGO The Hobbit remain largely unchanged from LEGO Lord of the Rings, or the LEGO titles that came after it. Youll gain access to a large cast of LEGO characters, each with different abilities and attributes. Youll smash LEGO objects, collect LEGO studs, work your way through mild puzzles, and advance the story depicted by the films. The questing element of LEGO Lord of the Rings remains intact, allowing you to explore Middle-Earth freely, taking on side-missions and uncovering various secrets. The more minifig characters you gain access to, the more youll be able to unlock. But if you simply desire to see the game through from the beginning to end of the story, youll have little trouble doing so by sticking to the path laid out between chapters.LEGO The Hobbit does introduce some new elements. The largest of which is the crafting and loot system. While previous games have focused on a large number of breakable objects, theres been little reward given outside of the LEGO studs, used as a currency to buy new characters. LEGO The Hobbit also introduces materials used for crafting items or parts, including a new building feature which awards bonus studs dependent on quick reaction time.", "date": "April 18, 2014", "grade": "B"}
