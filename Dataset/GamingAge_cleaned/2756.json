This is both a good thing and a bad thing.Its good becausewell, because it reminds me of those two games I really like. Roundout gives you a series of letters, and you have to use them to fill in a pretty large crossword puzzle with words of three or more (and occasionally four or more, or five or more) letters. Given that a) my only (very minor) complaint about Wordscapes is that the puzzle boards are occasionally a little small, and b) my only complaint about Word Wheel is that the game insists on having one letter be included in all words, which means youll always find more words than the game will accept, theres a lot to be said for the way Roundout basically resolves both of those issues. You get a pretty large crossword puzzle to fill out, and there arent nearly as many restrictions on what words the game accepts.And yet, despite these improvements, I didnt get as engrossed by Roundout as you might expect  perhaps because it hews so closely to those other games. Yes, theres a bigger board to work with, but thats about the only advantage it has over Wordscapes. Otherwise, that mobile game feels like it moves at a much faster pace, and it has the advantage of having a pretty generous hint system, whereas Roundout has nothing at all. While its nice to be challenged like that, it still means youll often be racking your brain to come up with that one last obscure word in order to finish a puzzle. (Mind you, that generous hint system in Wordscapes comes at the cost of either sitting through ads in the free version or paying a premium to get rid of them, so it kind of balances out.)Of course, Id be lying if I said I wasnt every bit as addicted to Roundout by POWGI as I am every other word and puzzle game that Lightwood has released. It may not be my new favourite game, but its still a solid enough word game that Ive sunk a substantial amount of time into it already, and Im quite sure that Ill be sinking many, many hours more into it as I try to 100% the remaining puzzles too. If youre the kind of person who loves thinking up word combinations to pass the time, then this is sure to be right up your alley as well.", "date": "January 19, 2021", "grade": "B"}
