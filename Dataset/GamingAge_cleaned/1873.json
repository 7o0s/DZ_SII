{"name": "Magrunner: Dark Pulse", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/11/magrunner-dark-pulse-review-psn-xbla-pc/", "text": "Is Magrunner: Dark Pulse one of the hackiest and most derivative games ever? Or is it a very good mind-bender with great puzzles and a story thats just flat out crazy? Or is it, somehow, a little of column A and a little of column B? That I cant figure out which possibility it is even after playing through the game is a sign of something  though what, exactly, that something is, Im not sure.In the hacky/derivative column, theres the fact that Magrunner: Dark Pulse is, at its core, a pretty blatant Portal rip-off. I mean, technically, youre solving puzzles by shooting magnets instead of holes, so its not just a reskinned version of Valves classicbut at the same time, it looks and plays similarly enough that my wife was able to walk in on me playing it and ask, Is this another one of those Portal games?Of course, the key difference between the two is that shooting portals around is awesomely fun, whereas Magrunners magnets (or pulses, or whatever you want to call them) can, at their worst, be incredibly infuriating. While theres a lot to be said for requiring players to be precise  especially in a puzzle game such as this  Magrunner is occasionally too demanding, requiring players shoot magnets at the tiniest spaces possible in less-than-optimal circumstances (i.e. while trying to create a whiplash effect without magnetizing the cumbersome box youre expected to carry on top of a platform thats not particularly large in the first place). Also, making it so that your portal magnet gun shoots out a stupid little magnetic dog named Newton is really, really not helpful.The other huge difference between Magrunner and Portal: the latter is brilliantly written, whereas Magrunner is not. It wants to be that, I suspect, but when you you name your villain Kram Gruckezber and you make him the owner of an all-encompassing social media website called Life*Net, its a pretty clear sign that the kind of subtle wit that marked Portal probably isnt your strong suit.And yet, despite those complaints, theres no denying that Magrunner: Dark Pulse does a lot of things right  or, at least, knows how to make things interesting. Take the story, for instance. It starts out seeming like its going to be your run-of-the-mill plot about an evil corporation, but its not long before that goes flying out the window in favour of some barely coherent (but in a good way!), somewhat insane (also in a good way!) narrative about evil cultists trying to resurrect Cthulhu. Without spoiling too much, the whole thing winds up in outer space. I may not have been able to follow every twist in the story, but, at the very least, there was something refreshingly bonkers about it all.More importantly, though, theres the fact that Magrunners puzzles were enjoyably challenging. Infuriating at times, to be sure, but at their best, they really forced me to think things through. (And, if Im being honest, Ill even admit that they drove me to looking up a walkthrough on multiple occasions.) They may not be quite as fun as those in Portal or Portal 2but really, how many games are?", "date": "November 7, 2013", "grade": "B+"}
