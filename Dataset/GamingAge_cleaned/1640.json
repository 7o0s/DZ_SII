{"name": "Run Like Hell!", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/09/run-like-hell-review-ps-vita/", "text": "Ill give Run Like Hell! credit where credit is due: as endless runners go, it could be a lot worse. The last endless runner that came to the Vita, Z-Run, was abysmally bad, so you dont have to look far to see an example of the genre on this device at its absolute nadir. Run Like Hell! isnt great, or even good, but its never quite that bad.In large part, this is because the controls are significantly simpler. Theres no swiping around, hoping the game registers what you want it to do. Theres just a couple of buttons  jump, slide and adrenaline  and their usage remains the same throughout the game. Theres the odd new environment to learn, but even then, youre just applying what you already know to slightly different contexts. The whole point of endless running is simplicity, and, thankfully, Run Like Hell! realizes that.Admittedly, that also comes with a few downsides. The game is pretty short  not counting the multiplayer mode, which Ill admit I havent tried  but its still kind of repetitive. Because it goes so hard on simplicity, it doesnt take long before it feels like youre doing the same level over and over again. After youve been chased through one jungle by African cannibals, youve been chased through all the jungles Wait, whats that? African cannibals? Yeah, about that: in addition to being a middling endless runner, Run Like Hell! is also crazy racist. Like, were not talking about one or two pieces of questionable imagery, or something incidental to the plot; this whole game is built around a conceit that wouldve been questionable sixty or seventy years ago. You can debate all you want about whether there are/were African tribes that put bones through their noses, the fact is, in this day and age, theres only so many ways you can interpret a game about loincloth-clad black people running after a white man, especially when theyre literally chucking spears at him. Oh, and when youre caught they drag you off hanging from a stick with some kind of indeterminate fruit stuffed in your mouth. About the only thing missing from the whole racist tableau is natives dancing around a boiling cauldron, though for all I know that may have been in a cutscene I skipped over.", "date": "September 16, 2014", "grade": "C-"}
