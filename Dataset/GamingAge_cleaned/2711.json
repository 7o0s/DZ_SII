{"name": "UltraGoodness 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/03/ultragoodness-2-review-for-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Given how same-y a lot of twin-stick shooters feel, UltraGoodness 2 has a couple of points in its favour right off the bat: it looks good, and it has a fun hook.First, the graphics. While the game admittedly doesnt have to show off much  were talking about a top-down twin-stick shooter, after all  its still surprising how nice it looks. Everything has a paper cut-out vibe to it, and no matter how crowded and frenetic the levels get, they always look like theyre popping off the screen.As for the hook, itll be familiar to anyone who ever played Superhot: the world slows down to a crawl any time youre not moving or shooting. While its tempting to move and shoot as much as you possibly can because of the blasting music and massive explosions happening at all times, its important not to get sucked into all that. Its not often that twin-stick shooters reward patience, but UltraGoodness 2 is an exception to that rule.Of course, if you look even the tiniest bit deeper than that  by which I mean if you play this game for more than five minutes  youll quickly discover that UltraGoodness 2 is basically like any other top-down twin-stick shooter. You run around (albeit at your own pace), you shoot everything, you move on to the next level; its not very complex.But it doesnt really need to be to stand out from the crowd. Its not as if twin-stick shooters are generally known for being memorable, so simply by being a little different from the norm, UltaGoodness 2 stands out. Its not going to be the greatest game youve ever played, but if you like the genre and want something a little different, it may be worth your time.", "date": "March 16, 2021", "grade": "B"}
