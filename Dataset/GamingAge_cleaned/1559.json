It came out on every other platform six months ago, Ubisoft was oddly coy about its continued existence for the longest time, and when it finally did come out, it was quietly released on the same day as approximately twenty other games, including one of its biggest influences, GTA V on PS4 and Xbox One. On top of that, theres a not-insignificant chance that it represents the last AAA third-party game well see on the Wii U. All of which is to say, it would be very easy to look at Watch Dogs on the Wii U and think about all the extraneous stuff, rather than the game itself.Of course, this isnt anything new. In fact, as anyone who played the game back at launch can attest, for all the hype the game received prior to its release back in May the actual product turned out to be a little underwhelming. Rather than being some kind of massive game-changer, Watch Dogs turned out to have a pretty run-of-the-mill (to be charitable) story alongside graphics that were nowhere near as good as initially advertised and gameplay that, hacking gimmick aside, wasnt anything revolutionary.In a way, then, picking up Watch Dogs on the Wii U now, rather than months ago when it may have felt like the game was massively overpromising and underdelivering, might not be the worst thing in the world. After all, if you dont go in expecting much, its a lot harder to be disappointed. Freed from the prerelease hype, the hacking aspect is pretty fun; it may still be a little silly, sure, but its genuinely fun to drive around Chicago causing mayhem by turning traffic lights on and off, randomly making bollards spring up in the middle of the road, and doing all kinds of other little things that make people react in weird ways. None of it is really that consequential, but that doesnt make it any less fun, provided you can embrace its inconsequentiality.(And speaking of inconsequental fun, Ill note that the AI here is just as spectacularly dumb as it was on the PS4 version. Words cannot capture the joy I got when I discovered that there are places you can go  like, say, on the water, or beneath a parking garage ramp  that no one can reach you, and you can wreak all the consequence-free havoc you want because enemies are too stupid to do anything about it. Maybe it says something disturbing about my personality, but every time I was able to watch from a safe distance as cop cars just kept plowing into each other, each time shouting Im going to ram him!, I couldnt help but giggle like an idiot. I doubt thats what the developers intended, but holy crap was it hilarious.)That said, the flaws that were so obvious back in May are just as obvious now. The story is still pretty terrible. This, of course, shouldnt come as a surprise, since its not like they couldve changed it up all that much just by porting the game over, but still; Aiden Pearce still has that creepy, quasi-incestuous thing going on with his sister, and theres still a big reliance on technobabble and entry-level philosophizing in place of having anything to say.Likewise, the graphics are still pretty meh. To some extent, this is to be expected. After all, the Wii U just isnt as powerful as the PS4 or the Xbox One, so it shouldnt come as a surprise that Watch Dogs doesnt look as good here as it did on those consoles. Nonetheless, even with lowered expectations, this still looks a little flat and lifeless. Its not as bad as, say, the gap between the Wii and the PS360 or between PS2 and PS3, but its still pretty noticeable, and considering were talking about a game in which the graphics were already a little disappointing, you can see why I  or anyone else whos ever played an HD game  might not be awed by them.Its not all bad, though. The driving is noticeably better, as far as Im concerned. Whereas I found it to be a huge chore in the PS4 version, navigating vehicles seemed to go a lot more smoothly here, even if you havent bought any driving upgrades. I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that here I was able to just hop into a car and instantly have it go exactly where I wanted. I wasnt able to do that back in May on PS4, and I dont think that any of that can be attributed to my own improvements.(Speaking of driving, another aside: the streets here seem a little emptier than they did on the PS4 version. Whereas the Chicago of PS4s Watch Dogs was teeming with big, heavy duty vehicles that could drive around town smashing through everything in their way  another of the great side effects of braindead AI  here it didnt feel like there were nearly as many firetrucks, dumptrucks, or any other large vehicles suitable to causing mayhem.)The biggest improvement, though, has to be the existence of the GamePad. Its hardly a revolutionary concept to use the Wii Us second screen just to show a city map, but it still feels amazing. I loved being able to just look down at the GamePad to see where everything was, rather than having to pause out of the game and search around.", "date": "December 10, 2014", "grade": "B"}
