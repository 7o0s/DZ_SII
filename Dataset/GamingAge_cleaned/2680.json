I mean, seeing as my whole interest in the series stemmed from being a Vita completionist  as opposed to a love of Japanese gaming in-jokes  the other Neptunia game have always been kind of hit-or-miss for me, but even by the niche standards of the series, this one is pretty darn specific.See, Neptunia Virtual Stars finds series aiming its satirical eye at the world of V-Tubers. I, on the other hand, barely even watch YouTube, and wouldnt even be able to name a single YouTube star, let alone a virtual YouTube star. So right off the bat, it was clear that Neptunia Virtual Stars, with its V-Tuber guest appearances and what I assume are references to that whole subculture, was pretty far from my usual fare.Still, that in and of itself shouldnt have made the game such a chore. I have no problem playing any number of games that are based on subcultures that Im completely ignorant of, so its not like the appearance of random animated YouTubers should be disqualifying.On top of that, even if Neptunia Virtual Stars is crammed full of lengthy expository dialogue, that shouldnt be inherently disqualifying either. After all, every Neptunia game is crammed full of lengthy exposition  the series has never understood the idea of show, dont tell  and that hasnt stopped me from enjoying some of them. I long ago learned that you just have to know when to set the dialogue to auto (and maybe fast-forward), and then zip ahead to the next bit of action.And that, more than anything else, is where the game really turns into a slog: the action here is incredibly boring. Neptunia Virtual Stars finds the series venturing into the world of third-person shooters, and its astounding how quickly that goes wrong. Part of it is boring bullet-sponge enemies  and an overabundance of them at that. Part of it is dull level design. Part of it is how incredibly repetitive it all feels, almost from the get-go.Perhaps one of the biggest parts, though, is how grating this game sounds. I got so sick of the main characters screeching the same thing over and over again as they were in battle while the same music blares in the background that I had to mute my TV to keep my hearing and my sanity intact.Really, though, its probably everything taken together. Unless you fit into a very specific box  that is, V-Tube fan who loves repetitive action, meandering dialogue, and awful noises  youre probably not going to get much out of Neptunia Virtual Stars,", "date": "April 19, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
