{"name": "Demon Gaze", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/05/demon-gaze-review-ps-vita/", "text": "On paper, there are all kinds of reasons why I should hate Demon Gaze. Its a first-person dungeon crawler, and Ive never been huge on first-person games (navigating around makes me feel discombobulated). The only way you can move around efficiently is with your d-pad, even though youre walking around in a fully 3D world, and youd think that such a setting would be ideal for making use of the PS Vitas twin thumbsticks. Its full of female characters who are simultaneously very young-looking and incredibly well-endowed (which, of course, necessitates highly impractical boob armour). The battles arent just turn-based (which isnt inherently a bad thing, as games like Conception II and the Atelier series have taught me), they also seem to drag on forever, even when youre facing the most basic opponents on the easiest difficulty settings. Basically, if you were to take every game ingredient I hate and blend them all together, youd wind up with something like Demon Gaze.And yetthe end product isnt something I dislike. I mean, its not going to wind up on my year-end GOTY list or anything, but at the same time, Im confident that it wont be anywhere close to being the worst game I play in 2014.Thats hardly the most ringing endorsement, I know, but Demon Gaze isnt a game that deserves a one of those. Even setting aside my personal gaming preferences, I think its fair to criticize the game for the fact that moving around is a chore, and for combat that has absolutely zero flow to it. Throw in those aforementioned issues that offend my delicate sensibilities, and you can see why Id be hesitant to recommend it.That said, it has a few points in its favour. Even if Im not crazy about how some specific characters are presented (witness, for example, a scene early on where you encounter a female character, and shes in her skimpy underwear for no reason whatsoever), the game as a whole looks pretty nice. The colours are vibrant, the backgrounds have great detail, and taken as a whole its all pretty visually appealing. Similarly, even if the characters may not look particularly deep, the dialogue flows surprisingly well and the story as a whole is decently engaging, even if its just your standard story about an amnesiac hero with a mysterious past fighting demons.", "date": "May 5, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
