{"name": "Hyperdimension Neptunia: Producing Perfection", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/06/hyperdimension-neptunia-producing-perfection-review-ps-vita/", "text": "If I didnt know that Hyperdimension Neptunia: Producing Perfection was a real game  if I hadnt played it myself  I might have believed it was made up. I mean, its basic plot sounds like some ban-worthy fanboyism from NeoGAF, not an actual game made by a gaming company in the real world: youve been summoned to Gamindustri by Neptune, Vert, Blanc and Noire (each of whom represent a gaming company), who need your help as a music producer in fighting off the scourge of mobile gaminger, sorry, make that in fighting off manufactured pop idols known as MOB48, who are stealing away the goddesses/consoles market share. I know that the whole thing is just an extension of the original Hyperdimension Neptunia, which was a full-length RPG parody of the gaming industry, but still: on paper, you have to admit that it sounds less like an actual game, more like the feverish dreams of someone with an irrational loathing of mobile gaming as a whole.Obviously, however, the game does exist  and whats more, not only is it real, its surprisingly good, too. Once you get past the silly plot, youre left with a fantastically addictive management sim in which youre tasked with guiding one of those aforementioned heroines to pop stardom. Its up to you to balance improving your singers stats versus resting them to reduce their stress, and every so often you get to put on a televised concert where youre in charge of the camera and stage effects.As you can probably tell, its not the deepest game, but on the flip side, it does everything it can to minimize its flaws. Where the original Hyperdimension Neptunia received criticism in some quarters for mocking RPG tropes while simultaneously being beholden to them, Producing Perfection seems to understand that the best way to avoid genre pitfalls is to not have them in your game. For example, when its time to level up your characters attributes, the resulting screens poke fun at the whole training concept by simply saying it happened (you went to a lab and talked to scientists, who told you useful things!) or it didnt (science is boring!). Better still, when its time for your character to rest, it simply says Your character when on a spiritual quest or somethingand thats it. No extended cutscene, no long dialoguejust a screen saying it worked. Likewise, there are points in the game where your character does some activity, but rather than making you go through with the hassle of actually going on a fetch quest, theres just a comment about a fetch quest having taken place, and youre on to the next screen.Some people, of course, might be annoyed by the repetitive nature of it all  but if they are, theyre totally misunderstanding the nature of management sims on a portable or mobile device. Much like all those Kairosoft management games  which, come to think of it, are some of the best comparisons for Producing Perfection  this game captures all the core elements of a given job (in this case, pop stardom) and takes away the whole slogging aspect. Its just high points, all the time, and even if those can feel a little repetitive at times, it moves through everything so quickly that you never feel too bogged down in the details.It helps, too, that Producing Perfection has a pretty great sense of humour. Not only does it poke fun at the tropes, it has genuinely funny dialogue; I challenge anyone to get through a scene where one character is verbalizing peeking around the corner by literally saying Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeek without at least a bit of a titter. Likewise, it pokes fun at people with unhealthy anime/pop/Idol obsessions, some of the absurd costumes you find in RPGsbasically, anything thats in the game is either skewering some target or is there to be skewered. Its a nice change of pace from the usual seriousness affected by so many games, and it suits Producing Perfection well.", "date": "June 18, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
