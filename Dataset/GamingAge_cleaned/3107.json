Youre in control of a trio of instruments who want to form a band, and each of them can only move in specific ways, none of them particularly helpful. On top of that, these instruments exist in a world thats also awkwardly-shaped, so not only are you maneuvering objects that dont move very well, youre doing so in environments that arent very player-friendly. Additionally, the camera leaves a lot to be desired, so it feels like youre never quite able to get the right viewing angle.Further, the levels seem to jump back and forth between incredibly easy and absurdly hard, with almost no ground in between. The easy ones can be finished in a couple of seconds, but the hard ones seem to require pure dumb luck. Youll usually get to the end if you just keep moving things around for a several minutes, but youll also have no idea how you got there. Thankfully the Kine doesnt keep track of your time or assign scores to each level or anything, but that doesnt make the tougher levels any more palatable.Yet, even with those complaints, I cant help but love Kine. Its adorable, and charming, and sweet, and its got a fantastic soundtrack to round it all out.Some of this should be expected. After all, its a game where the main characters are instruments, so it only stands to reason that the developers made extra effort to fill Kine with a soundtrack thats jazzy and pleasant to listen to. Even when you make a wrong move, and youre rewarded with a discordant accordion blat or oddly-timed drum roll, it still finds a way to make the wrong notes sound musical. And, of course, when everything unfolds as its supposed to, it sounds fantastic too.It helps as well that the three instruments  Euler, Quat, and Roo  are pretty well-written characters, with distinctive personalities and a story that makes it easy to root for them. Its hardly ground-breaking to write a tale about musicians who want to make it big, and not even making the musicians instruments changes that, but theyre so cute, its easy to forget the clichd nature of it and just enjoy the story.", "date": "January 9, 2020", "grade": "B"}
