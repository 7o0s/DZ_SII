{"name": "Nihilumbra", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/02/nihilumbra-review-ps-vita/", "text": "At first glance, it seems like Nihilumbra isnt so much a game as a collection of quirks and traits from other games. A graphic style that recalls Limbo (albeit a slightly more colourful version of Limbo). Dokuros touch-based gameplay mechanics. A narrator throwing insults at you that sound like theyre cribbed from Stealth Inc., if Stealth Inc. were given a heavy dose of Braids mysterious philosophizing. Basically, you could be forgiven for feeling like youre playing a greatest hits of puzzle-platformers, rather than a game that brings anything new to the table.Im not going to lie: that feeling never goes away entirely. The game is introducing new mechanics right up until its last chapter, and its dark nihilism continues even after the final credits have rolled, so everything in the above paragraph is sustained from start to finish.Midway through the game, though, Nihilumbra stops feeling like a collection of other games and starts standing up on its own merits. Theres no specific point or anything; it just kind of happens that you realize, regardless of whether its heavily influenced by other games or not, its actually pretty fun.It helps tremendously, of course, that the aforementioned touch-based mechanics work extremely well. Regardless of whether youre spreading fire around the ground beneath enemies, connecting one electrical box to another to make platforms work, or zipping along the ground as you create a path of ice with your finger, it always feels natural, rather than gimmicky. You never get the sense that touch controls were added on just because it was something the developers could do  and anyone who doubts that need only spend a minute or two trying to switch from one power to another via the shoulder buttons.Likewise, the visual style may feel a little  and at times a lot  like Limbo, but the further in you get the more you realize that those dashes of colour make a big difference. Each colour represents something new, and bit by bit, they give Nihilumbra a personality all its own.Its not all great, mind you. The philosophizing narrator definitely gets a little annoying after awhile, particularly in sections where youre feeling your way through; hearing the same few words over and over again can really grate on the nerves. Not only that, it makes the game feel like its taking itself far too seriously. I mean, considering were talking about a game where youre trying to escape The Void, that makes some sense, but every so often you wish the game would lighten up even a little bit.A little nihilism can be excused when the end result is so enjoyable. Whats a little harder to take, however, is the games length: you can beat it easily in under five hours. There is an extra mode that you can unlock after beating the game, and it does ramp up the difficulty significantly, but if were looking just at the main game, theres no way around it: its pretty short.", "date": "February 4, 2015", "grade": "A"}
