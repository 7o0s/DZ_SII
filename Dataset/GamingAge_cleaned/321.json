This may not sound like an essential piece of knowledge, but seeing as theres a point of no return in this game after which it becomes impossible to meet a specific goalwell, without getting into spoilers, youll be wondering where the reset button is when you inevitably find yourself clicking around the options menu, trying to figure out how to start everything over.That weird oversight aside, Reigns is an absolutely wonderful game. Its essentially what happens when you cross Tinder with a text adventure. Playing as either a king or a queen (hence the name), youre given a series of binary choices, and your decisions have impact on your rule in terms of the Church, the People, the Military, and the Treasury. If anyone one of those levels gets too low or too high, youre likely to find yourself being crushed by an adoring mob, or making the army strong enough to overthrow you. Its an incredibly simple mechanic, but Reigns constantly shows that it opens up all kinds of possibilities.In large part, this is because the writing is so strong. Even though the game follows your character over course of a millenium, the world is populated by a few constant characters, each of whom has their own distinctive voice. On top of that, Reigns has enough variety that you can never quite tell where the game is going to go  you can find yourself swiping along, weighing the merits of a tax hike and dealing with border skirmishes, and then suddenly, youll be asked to romance a pigeon, deal with a dog thats been possessed by the devil, or find that youre the target of an assassination plot. On top of that, the game is a constant study in unintended consequences and utilitarianism, where you have to figure out what will benefit the most people (and, sometimes, what will benefit you the most). Its a constant balancing act, and Reigns knows how to it fun.In this respect, its helped by an addictive user interface. While Ive never used Tinder, this game makes me understand exactly why its so popular. Swiping right and left is incredibly intuitive, and the game is designed in such a way that youll constantly find yourself going, Okay, just a few more swipes, and then Ill put it aside.Ironically, this also leads to Reigns one downside: if you play it for too long at any one time, youll notice that it starts to repeat itself, especially on the Queen side. Theres a lot of content here, but the game has its limits, and youll find those limits sooner rather than later if you try and power your way through to the end with no breaks.Its a sign of how addictive Reigns is, though, that powering through without any breaks feels like an inevitable outcome. Its designed to suck you in, and if you want to discover a unique experience, youll give in and let that happen.", "date": "December 21, 2018", "grade": "A-"}
