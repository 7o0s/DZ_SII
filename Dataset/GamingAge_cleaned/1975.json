For example: be ready for some ever-so-slight racism.Actually, thats probably overstating things and using needlessly inflammatory language. After all, a key part of the games story involves voodoo (as the title would imply), so it only stands to reason that it would include some outdated imagery, like shrunken heads and witch doctors. At the same time, however, when you go to open the game from the XMB menu, this is the image you click on. Maybe Im just being a little oversensitive, but when I see an image of a black person with an exaggerated lower lip and a bone sticking through their hair, I cant help but find it a littleracially problematic. (The fact the games publisher quickly changed the official cover art to this suggests that Im not the only person who thought that way.)So thats one thing. Another thing to be aware of: you need to play Voodoo Chronicles on a big, high def screen. And I dont mean that in a if you want to fully experience everything this game has to offer, youll play it on a big LCD screen sort of way. I mean that the game is almost literally unplayable unless youve got one of those. I started out playing Voodoo Chronicles on a small-ish LCD TV, and I could barely make out half of the hidden objects I was expected to find. It was only after I moved over to a significantly larger screen that I was able to find things like buttons, coffee beans and slightly-concealed heart lockets without just randomly moving my cursor around and clicking.And thats not all you have to know. More crucial information: Voodoo Chronicles is incredibly short  as in, it can be beaten, with 100% of the trophies obtained, in one medium-length sitting. None of the puzzles or minigames are that difficult (provided, of course, you have a proper-sized TV), and the game moves forward in a pretty linear fashion. If its a long, deep challenge youre after, this game wont provide it.Say, however, that none of that matters to you  that youre dead set on finding a hidden object game for your PS3, and you dont care that much about length, racial issues or image quality. In that scenario, would Voodoo Chronicles be worth your time?", "date": "August 1, 2013", "grade": "B-"}
