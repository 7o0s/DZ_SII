{"name": "Instant Sports Paradise", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/10/instant-sports-paradise-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps5-ps4/", "text": "The challenge for any sports mini-game collection like Instant Sports Paradise is that the genre basically peaked with Wii Sports Resort more than a decade ago, and its been all downhill ever since. Even the best of the rest  say, Go Vacation  still come off as pale imitations. With that as a starting point, Instant Sports Paradise was always going to face some pretty steep challenges to even seem half-decent.But lets be frank: it doesnt do itself any real favours by being this terrible.To be fair, Ill note that I played the game solo, and it does allow for up to four players. Whats more, I played it handheld, and one of the joys of Wii Sports was playing it with motion controls. So its quite possible that I wouldve enjoyed Instant Sports Paradise a little more if Id played it with other people on a big screen.That said, I think Id be more embarrassed about suggesting we play something so shoddy when the superior alternative would be to reconnect my Wii.Part of the problem is that of the dozen or so minigames on offer here, a good chunk of them are less instant sports and more cheap mobile games. Activities like Wok (where you spin your thumbstick around and around cooking various items), Ice Cream (where you match ice cream cone patterns), and Shell Hunt (where you walk around a beach picking up shells) would feel like dull time-wasters on your phone, and they dont feel any more enjoyable here. Even games that theoretically sound like sports actually arent  Air Hockey, for example, is more like a brick breaker clone (minus bricks to break), where you have to stop pucks from exiting down the bottom of the screen, while Table Tennis just consists of you bouncing a ping-pong ball up and down.Mind you, the sports that do bear similarities to their real-world counterparts arent much more interesting. Bowling consists of just a few frames with awkward controls. Seaplane consists of flying around, shooting at targets, battling with awkward controls. Wakeboarding and Jet Ski: both basically what youd expect, both marred by awkward controls.Just about the only sports that come off half-decently here are Archery and Mini-Golf, but even theyre not that fun once youve achieved gold in both. Archery is just a couple of targets with progressively gustier wind as you increase the difficulty, and Mini-Golf only offers the chance to play a couple of holes. In both cases, you can find those same sports in significantly better packages elsewhere on the eShop.Instant Sports Paradise is so bad that even the Paradise part of its name feels shoddy and half-hearted. The island on which youre stranded/vacationing is populated by a bunch of people who can only say the same short sentences, getting around is a pain, and it all looks grainy and ugly.Really, theres no saving grace to be found here. As I said up top, even in a best-case scenario, Instant Sports Paradise wouldve felt like a bargain basement version of Wii Sports Resort. But this cant even achieve that very low target. Instant Sports Paradise is a lousy game thats completely and utterly lacking in every way imaginable.", "date": "October 13, 2021", "grade": "D"}
