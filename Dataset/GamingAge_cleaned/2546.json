At a time when it feels like every game is either some big budget AAA extravaganza or an indie, its nice that theres still some space for a game like this that clearly falls in between. The whole AA/middle tier back in the Xbox 360/PS3 days (and earlier) was always home to some interesting  if not necessarily essential, or even good, games  and it warms my heart to know that Scars Above is carrying on that tradition.And, in that tradition, Scars Above doesnt have a unique identity so much as it feels like a mishmash of other, better  and better-known  games. Theres a heaping dose of Returnal, of course, with the whole female astronaut crashlands on a hostile alien planet and dies a bunch plot. On top of that, though, youll see hints of Mass Effect and Dead Space, and maybe even Soulsborne games and Resident Evil if you look hard enough. Basically, its good enough you can see its influences, but not good enough to make you forget about any of them.It doesnt help that the games lower budget is obvious everywhere you look. While the alien designs are spooky, there isnt a whole lot of variety between them, and youll see a lot of the same enemies over and over again. The same goes for the environments  theyre interesting at first, but if it werent for the fact the game basically funnels you from one point to the next and puts plenty of invisible walls in your way, itd be easy to get lost since they generally look very similar.Scars Aboves biggest issue, though, is that it has an overreliance on jump scares and cheap deaths. You spend a lot of time here walking through flooded swamps, and the games favourite trick is having enemies pop up out of the water next to you with no warning, attacking you, and then diving back down underwater. Since they seem to trigger at the same moment every time, eventually you get a feel for exactly when you need to have your weapons ready, but you still have to suffer through a lot of deaths to get to that point.On this front, the game is further let down by the fact the save points tend to be somewhat far apart. While the world isnt that big, its still a pain when you explore a decent chunk of an area, get hit by a poison projectile from a monster attacking out of nowhere, and then watch as your health rapidly deteriorates and you have to start the area over again.As flaws go, though, Ive seen much worse. Scars Above is a competent enough game that efficiently gets you through its six-hour runtime. It wont make you forget its influences, but if you can find this one on sale, you could definitely do a lot worse.", "date": "March 13, 2023", "grade": "C+"}
