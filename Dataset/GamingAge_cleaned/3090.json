{"name": "One True Hero", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/01/one-true-hero-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "One True Hero manages to feel both very modern and very retro at the same time.On the one hand, it feels very much like a 3D platformer from a few decades ago. You run around collecting gems, you hack and slash your way through enemies, and you do it all dressed like your standard fantasy hero. Theres really nothing in One True Hero that we havent seen countless times before.On the other hand, however, it has some commentary here and there to show it knows how tired a lot of these tropes are. There are one-liners about how the game is borrowing from Zelda from the villagers you encounter, plus a narrator who interjects a bit of humour into the proceedings at regular intervals.Of course, that raises the question: if youre doing the same thing thats been done a million times before, does it matter if you show some self-awareness while doing it? Personally, I dont think it does  being slavishly devoted to a formula is the same whether youre doing it knowingly or not. Just because One True Hero throws in a few jokes about it doesnt make it any more original.The games real problem, though, is that its not very well-made. There are bugs all over the place, with items popping in and out of existence, cameras going through scenery, slowdowns, freezes, and all the other annoyances youd expect from a game that seems half-baked. On top of that, even when it functions, its not very fun. The combat is pretty basic, and youll spend lots of time button-mashing to kill the enemies that occasionally swarm you. Theres also platforming, but the combination of sluggish controls and a camera that cant decide if its fixed or moveable make that whole aspect of the game a never-ending chore.What youre left with, then, is a mediocre game full of clichs and bugs. Everything in One True Hero has been done before  and much, much better  and youd be wise to play one of the games its borrowing instead.", "date": "January 2, 2023", "grade": "C-"}
