{"name": "The BIT.TRIP", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/12/bit-trip-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "As far as Im concerned, Runner 2 was one of the best  if also one of the most severely underappreciated  games of the last generation. Its colourful visuals popped off the screen, its gameplay was the perfect mix of simple and addictive, and Charles Martinet (aka the Voice of Mario) added some playful charm. It was, in short, ridiculously fun.The BIT.TRIP is sort of a prequel to Runner 2, collecting the six Bit.Trip games that precede it. Spoiler: none of them are as good as Runner 2. While all of them have their moments, it seems fair to say that none of them quite live up to Gaijin Games masterpiece.Thats not to say that none of them come close. Indeed, depending on what youre looking for in a game, its entirely possible that some of the titles included in The BIT.TRIP may even appeal to you more than Runner 2. Want something as simple as Pong, but with a more modern sensibility and soundtrack? Then Bit.Trip Beat will be right up your alley, with Bit.Trip Flux there for when youve mastered that game and are in the mood for something a little more complex. In the mood for a game thats slightly more arcade-y (but, again, with a distinctly modern soundtrack)? Then Bit.Trips Core and Void should meet that need, pairing deceptive simple ideas with executions that quickly show how complex they can get. Elsewhere, shmup fans should find plenty to enjoy with Bit.Trip Fate, while anyone wanting to experience Runner 2 in a more minimalistic, embryonic form should be pleased to learn that the original Runner is here too.You dont have to look very hard to see a common thread running through these games (beyond the basic fact theyre all easy to pick up and play, but very difficult to master). All six games have style to spare, with their frantic paces, vibrant colour schemes, and pulsating soundtracks. Even if the Bit.Trip series didnt reach its full potential until Runner 2, the six games on The BIT.TRIP show that whatever else their developer had to figure out (which, admittedly, wasnt much), the exceptional aesthetics were there basically from Day 1.", "date": "December 24, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
