{"name": "LocoRoco: Remastered", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/06/locoroco-remastered-review-ps4/", "text": "The PSP is back! Actually thats not entirely true The fact is that the first PSP remaster for the PS4 is here. LocoRoco was one of my favorite PSP games of all time and its fitting that it would be the first (of hopefully many) PSP titles to get a remaster treatment for the PS4. Originally released for the PSP in 2006, LocoRoco is a quirky super colorful puzzle platformer (lite on the puzzle). If youve read any of my remaster reviews (Triple-R) you know I have a complicated relationship with them; some are justified, while others are completely unnecessary. The PSP library is an entirely untapped remaster opportunity. The PSP has many classics (Metal Gear Acid, 3rd Birthday, etc.) and I think budget remasters would make a great home on the PS4.LocoRoco, at its core, is super simplistic. You grow the Locoroco by eating berries. You dont control them (besides jumping), you control the world by tilting it left or right which will send the Locoroco where you want them to go. Certain areas will also be too small for a larger LocoRoco to fit through, in these situations you can break up the LocoRoco in multiples that are much smaller in size, then regroup them when you feel it appropriate. If youve never seen or played LocoRoco this is going to come off like nonsense, so I would advise you at least watch a youtube video of some gameplay to get a gist what its all about.I havent played the original LocoRoco (they did make some sequels) in about ten years, and it was obviously played on a handheld. Upon booting up the game, youre treated with sharp vivid colors and if you never heard of LocoRoco before, you wouldnt even know it was previously a ten plus year old game for a handheld. I was hit immediately with all the nostalgic feels and it brought me right back to a simpler time. The game is really simple but its just got a fun relaxing vibe and it still draws me in and holds up, all these years later.", "date": "June 5, 2017", "grade": "A-"}
