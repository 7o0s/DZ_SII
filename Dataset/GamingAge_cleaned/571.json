Unfortunately, this is where our paths diverged. Where Dustin was pleased to discover that he had a slight affinity for the series, I had no such luck: Hackers Memory bores the crap out of me.In Dustins defense, after reading his review and comparing it to my experience with Hackers Memory, I get the sense that the two games are somewhat different. Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth was, apparently, action-heavy; Hackers Memory, by contrast, goes heavy on the story. Very, very, very heavy.I suppose this isnt an issue if youre invested in the Digimon universe and want to know more about the humans inhabiting it, but if, like me, youre more in the mood for having your digital monsters train and engage in cyber-combat, youll be a little disappointed. Theres not nearly enough of that, at least for my taste, since the developers seem to have decided that what people really wanted in Hackers Memory was endless dialogue and lots of real-world fetch quests that required your character to log off his computer and venture out into the streets of Tokyo.I should note, of course, that for what the game is, its certainly not bad. Theres a huge cast of characters that seem like theyre sure to interest players who are already invested in the universe, and even if that may not describe me, I give credit to the game for at least making them seem visually distinct from each other. Ive played a lot of talk-heavy Japanese games, and Hackers Memory definitely stands apart in this respect, particularly because some of the character designs are really pleasant to look at, just from an aesthetic perspective. The game also does a neat job of conveying movement during dialogues, having players walk across the screen as if theyre walking, making it seem like they exist in a 3D space rather than just flat screens where they slide on and off.And when you do finally get to the battles, theyre well done. Mostly your standard turn-based stuff, of course, but Hackers Memory at least assumes that youve got some idea what to do, and doesnt bog you down in endless explanations and tutorial screens. Its a shame there arent more of those battles, but, I guess, thats not what the game is.Id be lying if I said that Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth  Hackers Memory made me eager to check out more games in the series, let alone expand my horizons to see what else Digimon has to offer. But if youre already a fan, I imagine that this game is competent enough and expansive enough that youll find all kinds of stuff to enjoy.", "date": "March 23, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
