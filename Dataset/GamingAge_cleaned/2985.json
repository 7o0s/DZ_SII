As far as I could see from the trailer, it was basically a 50s mystery game, which was good enough to pique my interest. In other words, I cant really comment on the games faithfulness to its source material.Unfortunately, not everything here works so well  starting, unfortunately, with the game itself. The game has been patched substantially since it was first released, so it no longer crashes constantly, but there are still performance issues all over the place. The load times are ridiculously long, and even in the middle of dialogue and action sequences, theres a bit of a stutter as the game chugs along.Within the game, some parts definitely feel clunky. Blacksad  the character, that is  isnt anywhere near as lithe as a cat, and maneuvering him around various environments is always a challenge. This, in turn, makes examining objects somewhat difficult, since you have to be in just the right spot to press the button to make that happen. Its the same kind of system youd see in most adventure games, but it feels more ungainly here than it does in most places.And, apropos of nothing: the anthropomorphized animal thing occasionally feels a littlewell, racist, to be blunt. Theres one scene early on where you find out that the gorillas are black people, and the game explicitly states this as fact. Setting aside the whole question of why animals would talk about skin colour in the first place, its hard not to cringe at the mere fact of a gorilla being a stand in for a black person. I dont think Blacksad necessarily intended it as a slur or a slight, but, all things considered, its the sort of thing that really shouldnt need to be stated. (Ill also note that portrayals of race are apparently an issue in the comics, too.)Anyway, despite its flaws  both performance and otherwise  Blacksad: Under The Skin still makes for an interesting game. Its clunky (in more ways than one), but its also got a gripping story at its core, and its oozing style. Ive certainly played better adventure games than this one, but theres enough interesting stuff going on here that fans of the genre could do worse than checking it out.", "date": "May 11, 2020", "grade": "B"}
