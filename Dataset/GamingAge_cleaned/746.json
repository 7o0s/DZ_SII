{"name": "ChromaGun", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/09/chromagun-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "ChromaGun is awfully similar to Portal.I dont think Im saying anything that the games developers would dispute when I write that. In fact, seeing as they themselves titled their PlayStation Blog post from just over a month ago ChromaGun is Like Portal, Except Its Not, its probably safe to say that its a comparison that theyve actively tried to invite.Even if they hadnt, the comparison would be inevitable. I mean, its a game where youre running around a mysterious research facility, using a special gun to open and close doors, while a sarcastic voice eggs you on. If thats not Portal in a nutshell, I dont know what is.There are obvious minor differences, of course. Where Portal had you opening and closing portals, ChromaGun draws on your knowledge of grade school-level colour-mixing as you spray the blank walls with colour using the eponymous weapon. WorkerDroids  quasi-sentient floating balls  are then attracted to walls of the same colour; drawing them over top of switches opens doors, which in turn lead you on to the next level. Also, Portals heroine was much more agile; whereas Chells jumps felt like, well, jumps, when your character here in ChromaGun hops, it feels like youre barely moved.There are other, more significant differences between ChromaGun and Portal, though theyre less to do with gameplay, and more to do with ChromaGun simply looking worse by comparison. This games sarcastic, unseen narrator is clearly meant to evoke GLaDOS, except where GLaDOS was hilariously menagcing, ChromaGuns just comes across as kind of a jerk. The insults arent as clever, and the overall writing just isnt as good.Similarly, ChromaGun is far too prone to wasting your time with stupid little issues. The levels arent very long, but every time you reach a new one, youre forced to sit through a loading screen. Individually they dont take up too much time, but it doesnt take long before they start to add up. Similarly, its quite easy to play yourself into a corner; all it takes is one wrong colour, and the level becomes impossible to beat. When that happens, theres no way to fix your mistakes, and you have no choice but to restart the level from the beginning.", "date": "September 5, 2017", "grade": "B-"}
