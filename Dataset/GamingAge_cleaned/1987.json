Its always been an excellent recreation of the paper game, but the critics have always lamented the lack of true deck building. The big addition in Magic 2014 is a new sealed play mode that gives you booster packs to create your own deck. Its a great addition but is still just another teaser to get you into the paper game.If youve played any of the three previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games, everything other than the sealed play mode is going to feel nearly identical. There are still 10 pre-made 60 card decks to unlock and duel with. Game rules are exactly the same as the paper game. You battle against AI opponents that are using progressively better decks. Each battle throughout the story unlocks either a new card for your current deck or a new complete deck to play with.The new mode, which is the big selling point this year, is sealed play. This mode lets you unwrap six virtual booster packs, complete with the standard number of cards, uncommons, and rares. From that, you construct a minimum 40 card deck out of whatever cards you want, with as many colors as you want. This is analogous to booster drafts in the paper game, except you dont pass the cards to the left after you pick one.Finally, real deck construction, right? Thats a big step, even if it is four iterations later, but its still very limited. One, I think the card pool in the boosters is overly limited. I see the same cards in each of the packs I open. Two, there is no option for an actual multiplayer booster draft. Three, you only get two shots at this. There are two sealed deck slots, and each start with a set of six boosters. Once you open those, you are stuck with those cards. You can reset a deck, but you cant ever delete it and start with a fresh set of boosters. You can, of course, buy more sealed deck slots for like $2 a piece.The other 10 pre-made decks are very similar to the previous game. So much so, that this felt like a Madden upgrade. Mind you, its only a $10 game, but you still have to decide if its worth another dip in the pool. You still collect new cards for your pre-made decks, one win at a time, 30 in all. This time around you can micromanage the number and type of land in your pre-made deck, which was a much needed improvement.", "date": "July 19, 2013", "grade": "B"}
