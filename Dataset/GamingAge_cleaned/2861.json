Even though Ive played plenty of games that have descended from those groundbreakers in the late 80s/early 90s, this is the first time in many, many years that Ive actually played the real deal, and Im surprised by just how much I enjoy it.To a large extent, this surprise is because of the games reputation. It was originally released exclusively in Japan back in 1995, and from people who have played it over the ensuing decades, its become known for being kind of opaque and impenetrable even by the standards of the genre.And I do kind of get that. Right from the get-go, you have eight different characters to choose from, and the game changes a little depending on which one you pick. If you want to get the full story, you need to play through the game eight times, which could easily take in excess of 100 hours. Honestly, its a lot, and Im not even going to pretend that the story here was good enough to make me that invested.On top of that, the battle system is a little bit different from what you usually see in these kinds of games. Yes, youre engaging in turn-based battles with your team, but there are little tweaks to the now-standard formula here and there that make a lot less sense to someone playing the game in an era when the genre has pretty much been codified. Whereas now its standard to expect all members of your party will level up at something like an equal rate, in Romancing SaGa 3 the individual characters stats increase depending on how much they contributed to the battle. Battles are also a bit of a crapshoot, since the game  as far as I could tell  never tells you how much HP your opponents have.While the battles represent a bit of a departure from the norm (or, I guess, from what the norm has become since Romancing SaGa 3 was originally released), once you get into the rhythm of the game, you dont notice it as much. More importantly, because you have so many characters at your disposal, you can really mix and match your party until its exactly what you need.For the most part, the rest of the game is pretty much what youd expect. The graphics are every bit as SNES-y as youd think a 25-year-old game would look, and the music is all chiptunes. That said, Ive never written this about a game before, but I have to commend Romancing SaGa 3 for its impressively immersive sound effects. I dont mean that as a backhanded compliment or anything, either  theres one moment I recall particularly well in which I was wandering through a creepy castle, and I noticed the wind in the background. Im not going to say that I practically thought I was there, but its a sign of how well Romancing SaGa 3 does the little things.But its the big things  like, again, the 8 main characters and the 100+ hour story  that really define Romancing SaGa 3, and on that front, the game iswell, its an acquired taste, for sure. But if youre a fan of JRPGs and you want to see an interesting time capsule from the genres evolution, its well worth investigating.", "date": "October 5, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
