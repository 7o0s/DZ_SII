{"name": "Forza Horizon 2:  Storm Island DLC", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/12/forza-horizon-2-storm-island-dlc-review-xbox-one/", "text": "Looking for an excuse to jump back into the excellent Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One? Look no further than the equally excellent, recently released DLC Storm Island. While Driveclub might be the reigning king of console racing weather effects, that doesnt mean that Playground Games cant give them a run for their money. Storm Island makes good use of its title, featuring a whole lot of thunder, rain, lightning, and wind, with a heavy emphasis on off-road racing compared to the core Forza Horizon 2 experience.Once installed, you can access Storm Island via the port in Nice, which in turn transports you to a sizeable island location. Youll start off with an initial journey to the central hub of Storm Island, where you can then partake in a number of championship events spread out across six different tiers. In addition to the dozens of championships, you can hunt down the singular Barn Find, a very cool addition thats well worth seeking out, and one that I wont spoil here. Theres also new Bucket List challenges to check out, five new cars and trucks, new events like Rampage, Brawl, and Gauntlet, new rally specific parts for new and existing garage vehicles, and a host of online additions focused on the new Storm Island location.So while Storm Island does feature a $20 price tag, youre really getting a lot of bang for your buck. This DLC release is full of content to explore, with solid additions via the new events and vehicles that work as a natural progression from the ground work laid out by the base game. If you were disappointed in the low number of rally and off-road events found in Forza Horizon 2, youll be able to get your fill here with Storm Island.And then theres the aforementioned weather effects. Right from the start, youll be introduced to the murky, stormy environment contained within Storm Island. Vehicles are appropriately affected by the rain and mud, while fog will sprout from the ground below and restrict the visibility of every driver present. Swirling tempests can make a difficult race even harder, but theres an added sense of exhilaration as you attempt to navigate through new areas. Youll likely encounter a bit of frustration early on, but if youve already devoted dozens and dozens of hours to the core game, this expansion will provide just the right amount of added difficulty for you.", "date": "December 26, 2014", "grade": "A"}
