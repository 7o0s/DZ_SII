{"name": "Forza Horizon 3", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/forza-horizon-3-review-xbox-one-pc/", "text": "Im still pretty amazed at how well Playground Games managed to outclass their previous efforts with the release of Forza Horizon 2 just two years ago on Xbox One. And theyve done it once again with Forza Horizon 3, releasing this month on Xbox One and PC. Theres a number of areas where Forza Horizon 3 improves on its predecessor, but it also doesnt mess with an already winning formula. As trite as it is to say, if you loved the previous games, youll absolutely love this one. But if you havent jumped into the world of Forza Horizon prior to this, youll still want to give Forza Horizon 3 a shot, no matter what your affinity for racing games is.Like previous Forza Horizon titles, this sequel revolves around a party-like event called the Horizon Festival. This time it takes place on the continent of Australia, and runs the gamut of diversity when it comes to unique areas, such as beaches, city streets, rainforests, the outback, and more. Each area on this expansive map feels wholly unique, peppered liberally with events, speed traps, stunt jumps, drift zones, barn finds, and more Forza Horizon staples. Youll never be at a loss for what to do or how to progress, and generally will have multiple event types to choose from. The world is also populated offline by Drivatars, A.I. controlled drivers that roam the streets and backroads of Australia and add a little life to the overall surroundings, even if youre not playing online.But, on the plus side, online offers a fair amount this year. In addition to your standard online free roam, you can also participate in race events and games against strangers or friends. However, the big addition this year is the inclusion of campaign co-op for up to 4 players. Its easy enough to jump in and out of a game, and you can also set private matches or custom searches for event types youd prefer to play. While my online experience has been limited prior to release, everything Ive seen so far has run smoothly, with little to no network hiccups. That can change when the game goes live, but based on how well Forza Horizon 2 worked at launch, Im not expecting huge issues here.Youll find the Australian setting is absolutely breathtaking, giving multiple moments where youll just be awestruck at how great this game looks. Theres so much detail packed into the environments, the skyboxes look amazing, the weather effects are very realistic, and even the puddle physics from Forza Motorsport 6 have been included here. Of course, the cars, buggies, trucks and other vehicles look and sound equally amazing. Controls are on point, with multiple tuning options for players of varying skill levels, tons of livery options for customization, and even the ability to create custom license plates. Seriously, theres no lack of visual and control options here, much like weve come to expect from this series.Another neat addition this year is the ability to create custom events, which you can share with friends if youre particularly proud of what youve put together. You can control laps, race types, weather, time of day and a handful of other options. Other player creations are randomly pulled as well, along with the standard developer created events. This also extends to the Bucket List events, which generally consist of more skill specific challenges. So you can now create your own drift events, time challenges, and more. Theres a lot of freedom given to the player in Forza Horizon 3, and it shines through in multiple ways.", "date": "September 20, 2016", "grade": "A+"}
