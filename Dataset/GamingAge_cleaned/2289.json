{"name": "Spec Ops: The Line", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2012/07/spec-ops-the-line-review-for-xbox-360-ps3/", "text": "Back in the late-90s, single player military-based counter-terrorist action games were all the rage. Probably the most successful and certainly the most popular amongst current generation gamers is Tom Clancys Rainbow 6 series. Before the franchise got consolized it relied heavily on tactical strategy; you would map out all of your teams routes and room clearing methods, then have them execute your commands with lethal precision. It was a great sub-genre that unfortunately wasnt ADD-friendly enough to be maintained.One of the lesser known titles of the sub-genre (although successful in its own right) was Spec Ops. Unlike Rainbow 6 it failed in its transition to be more action-oriented, sticking to a more realistic format which ultimately didnt turn out to be as popular with console players. The last official Spec Ops game was released in 2002 (10 years already?) and after that whatever sequels had been planned were shelved Until now.Spec Ops: The Line is a re-envisioning of the franchise. And by that I mean the only thing thats similar is to previous games in the franchise is the Spec Ops in the title Honestly, this game was probably developed as The Line and then somewhere along the way a producer figured they could capitalize on the Spec Ops brand, leeching off the popularity of others. The good news, however, is that the game is actually pretty good in its own way (not the Spec Ops way), so its one of those I came for the Spec Ops, but I stay for The Line type scenarios.Youre Walker, the leader of a three man special operations Delta team sent to Dubai to rescue the 33rd infantry. Thats right; your team is so good that when an entire infantry gets lost, youre the three dudes they send online pokies in to find them. Dubai had fallen under a state of emergency after getting repeated slammed by devastatingly harsh sandstorms. While trying to rescue civilians, the 33rd mysteriously went out of contact  its vague as to what happened. A short time later, you and your team is sent into the sandstorm-torn Dubai online casino  to find out what happen to the 33rd; youre rescuing the rescuers. On one side its very future soldier-y, alternate reality post-apocalypse. On the flip-side, its not very Spec Ops Or at least not the Spec Ops we used to know.Playing the game feels more akin to a third-person COD game but not one of the good ones. Sandstorm justin bieber one time music video ends with this: Five years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and Im grateful to those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man. ravaged Dubai offers a pretty cool setting with all the huge dilapidated buildings and quasi-psychedelic clubs, but it gets a little marred by the cover-shoot-cover-ad-nauseum gameplay. Plus the controls are slightly clunkier than they should be which only exaggerates the games abrasiveness.Graphically Spec Ops: The Line seems a little stale as well. Not that its ugly, just that it looks fairly generic by this generations standards. Again, the only thing that gives it a little separation in the visuals department is Dubai and the variety of architecture that entails. Specifically with buildings crumbling and dust clouds whipping around. Come to think of it, even the multiplayer is pretty weak and not very noteworthy. There is a points system with unlockable rewards, but itll put you to sleep long before you actually unlock anything good.Now I know what youre thinking; a few paragraphs ago I said it was pretty good in its own way and then I spent the rest of the page discussing how generic it is in gameplay, graphics, and structure. The thing about The Line that is different is its moral ambiguity, and more over, its lack of direct consequences to your morally ambiguous decision making.Choosing right or wrong (or should I say, witnessing) happens quite a few times in the 7-8 hour campaign, but the results affect the characters more than your mission or your teams objectives. In that respect its fairly realistic; killing an innocent person or making the wrong choice doesnt stop the war or anything, but it does make Walker feel bad. Everyone gets agitated and the bag em and tag em, Hoorah attitude fades pretty quickly as the burden of their mission starts to weigh down the entire team. Its actually kind of cool and ends up being the games saving grace.", "date": "July 19, 2012", "grade": "C"}
