Going by that logic, its awfully tempting to just end my review of Skylight Freerange 2: Gachduine right now.Because seriously, theres not a lot of nice things to be said about Skylight Freerange 2. Even its name is an ungainly abomination. Every time I try to find anything positive to say about the game, it quickly devolves into complaints.Case in point: the good news about Skylight Freerange 2 is that it has plenty of character customization options. Right from the get-go, youre able to customize everything about your character, from their name and their gender all the way down to whether you want their hair to swoop up or if they should be wearing fingerless gloves. Of course, this is substantially less impressive when you consider that literally every customization option is hideous. This is a game that thinks that neckbeards AND mohawks are both giant squares that come out of a players neck or head, respectively. And that clothing isnt something your character wears so much as its various shapes imposed over his/her body.Or how about: hey, its cool to see a game with such a diverse cast of players. Males and females are equally represented, as are all the different races and ethnicities you could ask for. Again, though, no matter how diverse the game may aim to be, its hard to be enthusiastic about that when everyone looks like they stepped out of a budget PS1 game. Like, just go back and look at how Lara Croft looked way back when she was first introduced in the 90s, and then strip away a few layers of polish. That is how ugly the characters in SF2 are. Not that this is hugely surprising, though, since literally everything about SF2 is a visual monstrosity. Justeverything.Or maybe: its pretty clear that the makers of Skylight Freerange 2 put a lot of thought into their world-building. I mean, you dont often see games where the starting point is, What if Atlantic Canada got taken over by an evil cult? Whats more, its neat to see a budget game like this one use branching dialogue trees. Its a game full of inventive ideas, if nothing else.Unfortunately, nothing else is really all there is here. The games story is told via massive streams of exposition that make Japanese RPGs look concise, coupled with dialogue that, to be charitable, could use some very heavy editing.Or even this: its neat to see a game try new things when it comes to combat and movement. Its less neat when you realize that the combat is basically a convoluted game of paper-rock-scissor, but without any kind of rhyme or reason. And the less said about the totally unnatural, nightmare fuel way these characters move, the better.", "date": "November 21, 2016", "grade": "F"}
