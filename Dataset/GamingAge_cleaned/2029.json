{"name": "Tiny Token Empires", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2013/06/tiny-token-empires-review-for-psn/", "text": "As iOS games go, Tiny Token Empires is pretty amazing. Its an interesting combination of Risk-style turn-based strategy and match-3 thats perfect for gaming on the go. Of course, it also indulges in the unfortunate tendency of iOS games to nickel-and-dime you for every little bit of content, but thats beside the point: if youre looking for something fun on your iDevice, I couldnt recommend it any more highly.As a PSN download, though? Lets just say that as PS3 games go, Tiny Token Empires is a very good iPod game. Which is to say that it faces the same problem that also faced iOS-to-PS3 games like Angry Birds and Jetpack Joyride. While all three are great for filling up that 20 minute space you have to kill while youre commuting in to work or waiting around between classes, theyre not nearly substantial enough to sustain the kind of experience youre looking for if youve settled down on your couch in front of your PS3.Admittedly, as iOS games on the PS3 go, Tiny Token Empires probably comes closest to having the ingredients for sustaining a longer gaming session. While some of the early campaigns can be finished off relatively quickly, all it takes is one ill-advised attack or some bad matching luck, and all of a sudden youre stuck grinding out small victory after small victory. Not only that, the game lends itself to a multiplayer experience in ways that other iOS games do not. Of course, I say that more on a theoretical level than anything else  I tried connecting to the games multiplayer servers a couple of times, but I never had any luck finding anyone to play with.That lack of an online community isnt the games only drawback, either. On a related note, the AI is fairly unforgiving, punishing even the smallest mistakes. While thats obviously a plus for some, if youre going into it hoping for some casual single-player fun  as you might expect from an iOS game  youll quickly find yourself overmatched.Also not fun: navigating around the map. Its clearly an interface that was designed for fingers, not thumbsticks on controllers, and trying to look around the world to see whats happening elsewhere is awkward, to say the least.In fact, its enough to make you wonder why BiP Media ported their game to this particular Sony gaming device. Maybe its just me, but I wouldve figured that a game designed for handhelds wouldve been tailor-made for the PS Vita, what with its touchscreen and all. That they instead aimed a little higher and put their game on the PS3 seems like a missed opportunity.", "date": "June 5, 2013", "grade": "B"}
