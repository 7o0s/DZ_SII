{"name": "Wordsweeper by POWGI", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/10/wordsweeper-by-powgi-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-switch/", "text": "As Ive said at some point while reviewing one of the dozen or so Lightwood games Ive reviewed here at Gaming Age, I can divide releases from that publisher into two categories: those that I finish because I cant get enough of them (see Fifty Words), and those that I finish more out of obligation/addiction than anything else (see One Word or Fill-A-Pix).Wordsweeper by POWGI, unfortunately, falls more into the latter category.As with those other games I didnt enjoy quite so much, its not because Wordsweeper is built around a bad idea. Indeed, its actually kind of interesting, imagining what would happen if you injected a bit of Minesweeper into crossword puzzles. The black boxes are filled with the letters they touch all around them, and you have to decide which letters go in which white squares, with the end result being words in every direction as part of a completed crossword.The problem is that its an idea that exhausts itself kind of quickly. The difference between the easiest puzzles and the hardest isnt that substantial, and the letters and words are easy enough to figure out, either because youve got a decent-sized vocabulary or because the game makes it pretty obvious when youve made a mistake. Consequently, youll find yourself flying through what feel like the same puzzles over and over again, with little in the way of challenge.To be sure, Im still going to play it obsessively until Ive finished every one of the 120 puzzles. It wont take that long, and Im a sucker for word games. Thats no reason for me to recommend it to anyone else, though. Its a fun concept for a little while, but if youre looking for a fun word game that doesnt wear out its welcome, youre better off with one of Lightwoods other offerings.", "date": "October 28, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
