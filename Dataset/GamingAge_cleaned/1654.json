Or, at the very least, I feel like I should like it more than I do. Whichever way you slice it, though, the conclusion is the same: this game is kind of disappointing.The problem, I think, is that for such a stylized game, Metrico is awfully bland. On the one hand, its got a really neat hook  its a platformer, but one that tries to incorporate charts and graphs and math!  but in practice, that just ends up meaning youre playing a minimalist puzzle-platformer.Not that theres anything inherently wrong with being a minimalist puzzle-platformer. Indeed, considering the sheer volume of retro-inspired platformers weve seen for the last little while, its kind of nice to play one that doesnt have all kinds of nods to the 80s and early 90s. Where so many other games are 8- and 16-bit odes to developers childhoods, Metrico is all cool colors and sharp lines. There may be a hint of very early gaming in some of the designs  early as in, like, Atari, not Sega vs. Nintendo  but generally, this game is resolutely modern.The thing is, theres often not a huge distance between cool and modern and cold and antiseptic, and after awhile, Metrico starts to feel like it belongs in that latter category. The same goes for the music, too; Im not saying I want chiptunes in every single platformer I play, but at the same time, I cant say Im very drawn in by Metricos sparse, desolate soundscapes. Dont get me wrong, sometimes I love my music being all chilly and forbidding, but theres usually a limit to how much of that I can take  and that limit is usually around the length of, say, an Autechre album, not a whole game.It should come as no surprise that a game that looks and sounds cold and clinical could have its gameplay described in the same way. Every section of every level feels more like a math problem to be solved than a part of a living, breathing game (no offense to people who love math intended). And again, while thats not a bad thing  you could arguably describe much of Portal in the same way  after awhile you want something that feels a little more alive. I mean, its neat how developers Digital Dreams managed to create a game that incorporates so many of the Vitas various inputs, but that appreciation is more from a technical perspective than anything else.", "date": "August 28, 2014", "grade": "B"}
