{"name": "Coromon", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/08/coromon-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Coromon is Pokmon.Theres really no other way to describe it. And I dont mean that its an homage to Pokmon (even if the developers note on the eShop page that Coromon is our tribute to the classics of this RPG sub-genre), or that its clear that Pokmon had a major influence on Coromons development. I mean that Coromon is 100% a clone that doesnt ever try to hide its influences or intentions. Youre capturing and training monsters that are scattered around a retro-looking world, and your monsters battle other monsters in turn-based battles, and there are different types of monsters that are more and less effective in those battles.Let me put it this way: if Id gone into Coromon blind and someone had told me that it was a Pokmon game, the only reason Id have to be suspicious is that theres no Pikachu in sight.I dont mean any of that in a bad way, mind you. Much like last years Nexomon  another Pokmon clone that I absolutely loved  Coromon may not be original, but it nails its source material so well that its impossible not to get sucked in. As other games have shown, thats not the easiest thing to do. Whatever Coromon lacks in new ideas, it more than makes up for by being highly addictive.Moreover, Im actually selling Coromon a little short. It adds in plenty of customization options, so you essentially get to play Pokmon in your own way. You can add in randomization, you can change the circumstances in which you can capture other monsters, you can make it so that you get to choose your monster in every battle (rather than it defaulting to your lead monster and forcing you to play around with your party between battles)  there are plenty of options here, and they make it so that the game is enjoyable no matter your experience or skill level.To be sure, if you want something original  or even a unique spin on Pokmon  Coromon isnt it. But if you just want that kind of game done exceedingly well, you need to check it out.", "date": "August 1, 2022", "grade": "B"}
