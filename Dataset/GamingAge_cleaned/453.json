Youd think that a studio founded by ex-Criterion developers who had created the Burnout franchise would have no problem recreating the magic of their old series with games focused on explosive destruction, but Dangerous Golf and Danger Zone would suggest otherwise. The former was mediocre at best; the latter just plain sucked.As you can imagine, my expectations going into Danger Zone 2 were pretty low. I probably shouldnt have been so hasty in dismissing Three Fields, however, because this is where they finally deliver what had been expected from them all along: a game full of big car crashes thats actually fun to play.Surprisingly, Three Fields didnt need to change much from the first Danger Zone to get everything to work. Danger Zone 2 features the same mechanics, for the most part, as its predecessor. You still have to crash a certain number of vehicles to trigger explosions, you still have to earn a certain amount of money in order to move on to the next level, and youre still graded on how much destruction you cause.Whats different is the setting. Danger Zone got really repetitive really quickly in large part because it all took place inside a cold, sterile warehouse. This time around, youre let loose on the (somewhat) open roads, and it makes a massive difference. Rather than feeling like youre playing the gaming equivalent of crash test dummy videos, here you get to feel like youre causing real destruction. Youre flying down highways, knocking cars into billboards and road medians and, most importantly, each other. Theres nothing like sending a car plummeting into a ravine and seeing it explode in the distance, and you get to do that again and again here. As you can imagine, its pretty fun.To be sure, Danger Zone 2 still isnt perfect. Its physics are still a little wonky, in that sometimes you can send a car flying over the horizon with just the slightest tap, while other times its as if youve driven full speed into a brick wall. The scoring also leaves a little to be desired, since it wasnt uncommon for a level to end well before all the explosions had stopped, which seems a little unfair. Further, the whole thing is quite short, and can be finished in an afternoon even if you have a late lunch and an early dinner. And, of course, youre still not out on the open road, no matter how some of the levels may look  everything here is very linear, and woe betide any player who starts triggering too many explosions before youve finally reached the eponymous danger zone.Not that any of that was enough to diminish my enjoyment of Danger Zone 2. Were talking about a game where not only can you launch yourself off a ramp into the cab of a tractor-trailer (whose cargo is highly flammable gasoline) an overpass away, thats expected of you if you want to beat the level. Its not quite the full spiritual successor to Burnout that we need, but itll certainly do the job until that arrives.", "date": "July 27, 2018", "grade": "B+"}
