Its vaguely retro-inspired, but it never feels slavishly devoted to the late-80s/early-90s like so many other modern NES/SNES retreads. Its got a corny sense of humour, but it generally manages to avoid being too winking or knowing. The levels are just the right length, the difficulty level is perfectly balanced, and, perhaps most importantly, the controls are pretty tight.And yet, for all Spheroids does right, theres no denying its got its share of niggling little issues, too. Most obviously, its not the most stable game: it crashed on me numerous times, each without warning. Luckily, it saves often enough I never lost too much progress, but that didnt make it any less annoying. Likewise, there were the odd points where one little thing went wrong that essentially made the level impossible to beat. I mean, I understand why youd make it a requirement that Spheroids protagonist had to to dispatch all the bad guys in a section before he could move on, for example, but that also means that if even one of those bad guys gets trapped in an unreachable area, you need to restart the game and start the world from scratch. And in terms of much lower-level annoyances, theres the fact that the games humour, while far from terrible, does get a little repetitive after awhile, when you see the same mildly funny fake quote on the third or fourth loading screen in a row.", "date": "March 2, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
