{"name": "Lunistice", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2023/02/lunistice-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Given that the PS1-influenced games Ive played relatively recently were both deeply weird, when I read that Lunistice also had stylistic debt to that era, I wasnt sure what to expect given that its a 3D platformer. Would it be akin to something like Super Kiwi 64, or something far stranger?Something else entirely, as it turns out. After all, that era featured not just two gaming titans battling it out, but three  and its Sega and their crazy colour palette whose influence looms large over Lunistice.Almost everything about Lunistice feels as if it couldve come out alongside Nights into Dreams or an early 3D Sonic game, with lots of flashy environments and moving pieces. Not only that, everything has a slightly blurry, blocky look, which makes you feel like youre watching the game play out on a CRT screen. Add in a fair number of collectibles to pick up in each level, and you can see why the game practically screams 1990s.Theres one area, though, where Lunistice clearly sets itself apart from its influences: in how the games star, Hana the Tanuki, dashes and jumps her way through every level. Theres speed and fluidity to it that may echo Sonic, but more in the way Sonic plays in Sonic Colors or Sonic Frontiers. Its been a long time since I played those 90s 3D platformers on their original hardware, but Im quite sure that none of them were capable of moving so seamlessly and non-clunkily as the way Hana does here (nor could the camera keep up quite as well as it does here).And the best part? Lunistice is under $5. Given that its seven levels are highly replayable due to all those collectibles, plus a timer that gives you reason to strive for a S-tier run, and you can see why its easy to recommend this game.", "date": "February 9, 2023", "grade": "A-"}
