The Netflix adaptation having brought the Witcher series back into peoples minds seems to have pushed them to make sure to get the game spiffy and shiny for everyone returning and new players alike. For returning players, heres the good news: the upgrade is completely free on all platforms; better graphics and new content included.So what all comes in this The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  Complete Edition package? Well a lot, but also nothing incredibly game-changing. Of course, it comes with the graphical upgrades that you would expect from any next-gen upgrade. The cool thing about these graphic changes though is the fact that they were adapted from community-created mods. Its not clear exactly how much they took from the mods and how much they built upon them in-house, but its undoubtedly pretty exciting for the mod developers to get included into the game for all players.Documentation from CDPR says that 5 mods are included in the update. The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project, HD Monsters Reworked, Immersive Real-Time Cutscenes, Nitpickers Patch, Full Combat Rebalance 3, and World Map Fixes. These six mods were some of the most downloaded on the Witcher 3s Nexus Mods page, so it makes sense to see them included. Its always nice when a game company puts the effort in to support what I often call a communitys most devoted members the modders. I personally cant speak to what extent each of these mods were implemented, but CDPR are giving full credit to the creators.Xbox Series X and PS5 both get the option between two modes. Performance targeting 60 fps with dynamic resolution scaling, and Ray Tracing Mode, with does as the title says while maintaining 30 fps. The Series S being less powerful than its big brother also has two modes, but its a little more traditional to previous gen consoles performance vs quality modes. It allows for 30 fps with better resolution and visuals or 60 fps performance.Aside from the visual updates, there have been a handful of content additions as well. Nothing too crazy here, just a new side mission that rewards players with gear inspired by the Netflix adaptation of The Witcher and a few other references to the same show added in elsewhere. Also included is a handful of quality of life changes spattered about that you may not notice right out, as many are hiding in the settings. Things such as quick casting, alternative sprint modes, faster looting, font scaling and more. Definitely be sure to look over your options in-game when you boot it up.Theres not much to give an opinion on here, as much of the change implemented is visual and quality of life. Its a welcome update, and if its been a while since youve played or if youve just never gotten around to it, now is a great time to do so. The Witcher 3 has been in a good place for a while, but these upgrades further cement it in its spot as one of the all-time greats.", "date": "January 31, 2023", "grade": "A"}
