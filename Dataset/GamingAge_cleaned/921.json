Even now, years after the systems launch and the games release, it still stands as one of the top titles  not because of any lack of competition, but because its just that darn good. It made use of the Vitas many features in a natural, intuitive way, and it gave a system a little lacking in unique experiences one that showed everything the little handheld could do. It wouldve been amazing to play Gravity Rush 2 (and 3, and 4, and 5) on there.Of course, now that Ive played Gravity Rush 2, I can see why theres no way the game wouldve worked anywhere other than PS4.For one thing, its gorgeous. It takes a little while for the game to open up and show everything it has to offer  which, Ill note up front, is a bit of a running theme with Gravity Rush 2  but once it does, its a visual feast. The colours are vibrant, the environments are lively, and everything just looks amazing. It takes the originals comic book style and makes it into a living, breathing world. I dont want to take too much away from the first Gravity Rush, but once you get beyond the first few fog-filled stages and into Gravity Rush 2s proper setting, you dont have to look too hard to see the improvements.The same goes for the way main character Kat moves. The first game took the gravity part of its title pretty literally; it generally seemed like you were falling through space no matter which way you were jumping. Here, by contrast, when Kat takes flight, it really feels like shes soaring. At its worst, when shes tumbling through the air, it feels on par with any other game where characters can fly. And at its bestlets just say that if anyone ever gets around to making a proper Superman game, they should just steal what Gravity Rush 2 does. Kat soars and swoops and dives and generally moves in a way that just wouldnt have been possible on a handheld (or anywhere else, really).Flying is undoubtedly made more fun by the fact that you have a pretty cool open world to explore. Again, the first few chapters are spent in a foggy world that consists of a few floating sky boats and some rocks. It feels like a significantly lesser version of the first games city of Hekseville. Then the story takes you to the actual setting, and youre introduced to a literally whole new world of possibilities.", "date": "January 17, 2017", "grade": "A"}
