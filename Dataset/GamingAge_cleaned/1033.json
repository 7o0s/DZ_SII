{"name": "Brut@l", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/brutl-review-ps4/", "text": "I suspect that a little bit of nostalgia goes a long way towards determining whether youll really enjoy Brut@l. After all, its essentially a love letter to old-school roguelike dungeon crawlers, just with a fresh coat of paint. If you played those games back when they originally came out, I can imagine loving every second of seeing them reimagined with modern graphics made out of ASCII characters.And if you didntwell, then you may have a harder time getting into the game. At least, that was the case for me. I never developed a taste for roguelikes, so whether they have Commodore 64-level graphics or cutting edge ones, it makes no difference to me: all I really see is a game where you start at level one, you hack and slash your way through dungeons and enemies, and then you die and start all over again from the first dungeon. I know Im simplifying things horribly, but thats my impression, and even if Brut@l makes it look amazing, theres not much here changes my impression of the genre.Of course, in Brut@ls defense, the hacking and slashing is simple enough that even someone like me has no trouble picking it up. Early on, especially, this is a game where you can punch your way to victory (or at least the entrance to the next dungeon), which is pretty fun. And when you realize that you have a Captain America-style shield that ricochets back to you after you use it to explode traps and incapacitate enemies, then it gets really fun.Further, I should note that Im doing Brut@l a disservice by saying that it only puts a fresh coat of paint on ASCII dungeon crawlers. Simply put, it looks phenomenal. You wouldnt think a game where the dominant colours are black and white could pop off the screen, but this game suggests otherwise. More importantly, the developers understand that with such a limited palette, a little splash of colour can go a very long way. Hence, the red splatters that accompany every kill look amazing, as do the neon-tinged enemies who come chasing after you. No one is going to mistake it for Journey or anything, but in its own, limited way, Brut@l knows how to make a little do a lot.", "date": "September 2, 2016", "grade": "B"}
