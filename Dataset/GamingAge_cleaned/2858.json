{"name": "Othercide", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/10/othercide-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-switch/", "text": "If you play Othercide, youre going to die, and youre going to die frequently. It has nothing to do whether youre any good at tactical RPGs or not. Its how the game is designed.To back up a little, the story  as I understood it  behind Othercide is that youre playing as Mother, the greatest warrior who ever lived, in a war against an entity called Suffering, whos trying to bring about the end of the world. To battle Suffering, you send your Daughters into battle. To do that, you need to germinate new daughters constantly so you can regularly replenish your army and have enough troops at your disposal.Which brings us back to the aforementioned frequent death. See, there are constant autosaves here, and theres no way around it. The game even tells you from the get-go that deaths are permanent, and that youll need to build up quite an army to take what the game throws at you. As I said: youre going to die in this game, a lot. The good news is that you at least get to carry over some of your progression from battle to battle, so you dont have to start from scratch.The bad news? Youll have to go through lots and lots and lots of battles that will feel kind of similar pretty quickly. Admittedly, Othercide is also a roguelike, so the battlefields change every time, but because everything is so dark here  by design, as an aesthetic choice  you dont notice the variety the way you might in a game thats a little more colourful.Theres some irony in writing this, because Othercides look is also one of its biggest selling points. Its very gothic, all shades of black and white to help bloody splashes of red stand out even more. While it may lose some impact during the levels  roguelike or not, as I said, they look awfully similar  it makes for some very striking cutscenes.While Im not usually a huge fan of tactical RPGs, I can totally see how fans of the genre would get a lot out of this game. Between the roguelike nature of the levels and the fact youre basically creating your army from scratch, no two playthroughs of Othercide will ever be quite the same. Provided youre cool with dying a lot, that makes for a pretty unique experience.", "date": "October 7, 2020", "grade": "B"}
