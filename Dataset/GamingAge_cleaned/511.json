The Hollywood Roast is one of those games thats worthwhile if you can get it at a deep discount, and if you only plan on playing it for an hour or so. At full price, its not worth it, and if youre hoping for a game that will give you hours after hours of enjoyment its really not worth it, but in small doses and for a small price, theres something to be said for the game.I fully realize that this is probably the most lukewarm endorsement of OhSir! The Hollywood Roast possible, especially considering that full price for the game is, on most platforms and in most countries, under five dollars. But a lukewarm endorsement is pretty much all this game deserves. Its a fun idea, but, as you quickly discover, its also an idea that doesnt exactly lend itself to much in the way of variation.This, of course, should be no surprise to anyone who played OhSir! The Insult Simulator. That game also proved to be fun in very small doses, but wore out its welcome pretty quickly once you realized that, essentially, everything you needed to know about the game could be seen in its tutorial. Its basically the same thing here.Dont get me wrong: youre almost certain to have fun in your first playthrough of OhSir! The Hollywood Roast. Youll pick your character, have them go up against thinly-veiled parodies of Gandalf, Harry Potter, and Marilyn Monroe, and have fun putting together insults from whatever random words and phrases the game provides. Theres definitely a challenge to be had that first time through, as you try to figure out what insults will carry the sharpest bite for particular opponents.The thing is, though, thats all there is to the game. Its not like repeated playthroughs reveal hidden depths. What you see the first time through is 100% of what you get. You can extend OhSir! The Hollywood Roasts life a little through multiplayer, whether on your couch or online, but even then, its not like youre going to find new ways of playing the game.Still, at the right price (which is to say: not very much) and for the right amount of time (again: not very much), OhSir! The Hollywood Roast is worth a playthrough. Only one, mind you, and then youll never feel like playing it again, but still, for that one time, its kind of worth it.", "date": "June 7, 2018", "grade": "C"}
