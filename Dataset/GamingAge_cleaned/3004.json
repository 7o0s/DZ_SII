{"name": "Explosive Jake", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/04/explosive-jake-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Theres one specific scenario where it might be worth your while to check out Explosive Jake: if youve never played Bomberman or any of its clones before. Mind you, Bomberman and many of those clones are undoubtedly better than Explosive Jake, so I should probably amend that to say that youd only really want to check it out if this were a world where none of those other games existed.Of course, the problem with that hypothetical will be obvious to anyone who spends even a few minutes of playing Explosive Jake: theres no way this game would exist if Bomberman didnt. Apart from a few cosmetic changes, its basically an exact clone, and theres no reason to believe theres enough originality at work here to believe this game couldve come up with the concept on their own.I hate to be insulting like that, but theres really no other way to describe this game as anything other than a middling Bomberman clone. Theres no story. The hero is a skeleton who has to escape a series of dungeons forreasons. The graphics are vaguely retro, with no distinguishing features. The controls are as standard as they come, with the only thing that really stands out being the fact its awkward to move the eponymous hero around, which means that youre going to needlessly die quite a few times.That said, you only die if you play, and theres really no reason why you need to play Explosive Jake in the first place. As Bomberman clones go, its certainly one of them, and youre better off just seeking out the original instead.", "date": "April 21, 2020", "grade": "D+"}
