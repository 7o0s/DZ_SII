{"name": "1979 Revolution: Black Friday", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/05/1979-revolution-black-friday-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Now that Telltale Games is dead and gone, its reasonable to wonder wholl fill their old niche. After all, their brand of narrative-heavy adventure games were fairly popular, and their abrupt exit from the marketplace means there are bound to be plenty of people wondering where theyll get their new fix of episodic story games.With 1979 Revolution: Black Friday, Ink Stories make a good case for filling that void. While the subject matter  based on historical events  is nothing like the usual Telltale fare, everything else here feels like it could have come straight out of The Walking Dead. You have short chapters in which you subtly direct the action via your dialogue and your choices. You wander around small areas searching for clues to help flesh out the story. People around you remember the decisions you make. Theres the odd (annoying) quick time event. Even the graphics have more than a hint of Telltales, er, telltale visual style.On top of that, they seem to have figured out how to adopt many of Telltales good points without the bad to go along with it. The gameplay here seems to be bug-free. Likewise, the load times may not be great here, but theyre nowhere near the abysmal, eternal waiting that was a given in many of Telltales games.Obviously, though, the big difference between 1979 Revolution: Black Friday and The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones is that this game is based on real-life events. Whats more, theyre based on events  the 1979 Iranian revolution  that seldom get much attention in Western media. They provide an interesting insight into a period whose reverberations are still being felt today, and, at a time when some people are pushing for war in that part of the world, it serves as a good reminder that no country (especially one with a population as huge as Iran) should be viewed as a monolithic whole.The unique story is just a part of what makes 1979 Revolution: Black Friday such an interesting and worthwhile game. The bigger part is that it shows that Telltales formula will live well beyond that old companys demise, and it shows that the next generation of adventure game developers may have found a way to improve on an already strong base.", "date": "May 31, 2019", "grade": "A-"}
