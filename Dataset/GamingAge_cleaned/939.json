{"name": "Battalion Commander", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/12/battalion-commander-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "The fact that Battalion Commander was made by a developer called Smartphone Labs (or SPL, for short) should tell you pretty much all you need to know about the game. Its a mobile game through and through  and, judging by the basic gameplay and graphics, one that seems like a refugee from the very early days of smartphone gaming at that.Yet, despite its simplicity, I find myself totally hooked on it. Or, perhaps, Im hooked on Battalion Commander precisely because its so simple. Its not hard to pick up in the least; its essentially a shmup, only youre controlling a group of soldiers  a battalion, if you will  rather than a spaceship or a plane. You move up across the battlefield, and you gradually accumulate more soldiers, better weapons, and the odd power-up.And thats it  thats the entirety of everything the game has to offer. But because its so straightforward, it works in the best tradition of just one more time mobile games. Every single attempt you make adds to your XP, which in turn pushes you a little bit closer towards something new, whether its leveling up your rank, getting closer to achieving one of your mini-goals, or simply getting you beyond your personal best (which is helpfully marked on the side, reminding you how close you are with every try). Battalion Commander is a game that clearly understands how to make you feel a little but of reward for even the smallest little thing, which helps to keep you coming back again and again.Best of all, though, is the one trait it didnt bring over from mobile games: theres no paying to win here. It wouldve been the easiest thing in the world for SPL to implement paid add-ons in all kinds of ways, but they didnt, and for that, they should be commended.", "date": "December 12, 2016", "grade": "B-"}
