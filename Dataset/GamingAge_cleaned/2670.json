{"name": "One Escape", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/04/one-escape-review-for-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "One Escape is the fourth game Ive ever played by BUG Studio, and its possibly the best of the bunch.Of course, thats not exactly a huge accomplishment, seeing as the other three ranged from terrible to forgettable. So when I say that One Escape is possibly the best of anything, were not talking about a very high bar.By a more objective standard, it would probably rank asokay, I guess? As 2D puzzle-platformers go, its alright, but it doesnt do anything particularly noteworthy, for better or for worse. The game is about a trio of inmates  Dook the duck, Gor the gorilla and Hog the warthog  who are trying to escape from prison, and they each have their own unique abilities. Hog can punch through walls, Gor can climb them, and Dook cango through vents.Mind you, they never interact in any way beyond a game-opening cutscene. You start off with up to twenty Dook levels, then you get up to twenty Gor ones, then you play as Hog, and theres no connection between any of the three. They each just do their things, and while they occasionally get harder, they rarely feel hugely different from each other.Ill also note that I used up to in that last paragraph very intentionally. See, this is published by Ratalaika, who do their usual easy Platinum thing here by having the Platinum pop after youve only played 30 levels  10 for each character. You can keep going if you want after that point, especially since those levels are where the game gets challenging (and, honestly, a lot more interesting), but if you just want a Platinum, theres not a lot of reason to keep going beyond that.In fact, theres not much reason to even get to that point in the first place. While One Escape is tolerable for what it is  a short puzzle-platformer with an easy Platinum  there are more interesting games to play, and its hard to see why itd be worth playing this one over any of them.", "date": "April 27, 2021", "grade": "B"}
