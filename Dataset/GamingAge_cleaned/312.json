Its been a few years since I last played a farming simulator, and I have vaguely pleasant memories of those, so the thought of getting back on the virtual tractor was kind of appealing.What I didnt count on was how intensive  and intense  Farm Manager 2022 would be. This is no zen experience where you can get lulled by the daily rhythms of your farm life. Its a full-on, super demanding management sim that really puts you in charge of every aspect of your farm.Or, to compare it to the old Farming Simulator games I played years ago: Farm Manager 2022 is way more than planting crops, ploughing fields and feeding your animals. Rather, youre in charge of the minutiae of the logistics of managing your farm. You hire your staff, you buy all the equipment, you build the buildings, you make sure you have enough parking spots for all your machinery, you connect your buildings to the grid, you even call the fire department when something catches in fire  theres not a minor task to be found here that you dont have to manage. While theres nothing wrong with that level of detail, Farm Manager 2022 on the Switch suffers from the same problems you get with most other management sims on this system (or any console, for that matter): its very menu-heavy, which means youd better be ready to spend lots of time scrolling through lists in ways that arent necessarily intuitive.Having said that, if youre patient enough to sit through the very dull tutorial, youre rewarded with a game thats rich in content. Theres a campaign mode, where you gradually build up your farm; a scenario mode, where you have to accomplish specific tasks; and a free mode, where youre able to grow your farm to your hearts content. As these kinds of games go, theres quite a bit to do.But again, to do all that Farm Manager 2022 has to offer, you need to be willing to put up with some atrocious controls, and you need to be interested in putting in a lot of very detailed work. Its certainly not to my tastes  give me the zen pleasures of the Farming Simulator series any day  but if its a management sim youre after, youll find plenty to sink your teeth into here.", "date": "November 9, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
