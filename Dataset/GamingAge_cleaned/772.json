{"name": "Salt and Sanctuary", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/08/salt-and-sanctuary-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Since its PC release last year, Salt and Sanctuary has developed a reputation as being kind of like a 2D Dark Souls. And to some extent, this reputation is pretty well-earned. Its a bloody, difficult platformer with plenty of RPG elements. Its got a distinctly Gothic look and feel, and it doesnt lack for blood or violence. Youre battling your way through a haunted world, full of ghosts and monsters and all kinds of vicious creatures out to kill you. For all those reasons and more, the comparison is undoubtedly apt.However, I feel like reducing Salt and Sanctuary to simply 2D Dark Souls minimizes what the game does in its own right. For starters, there is that aforementioned Gothic look and feel. With all its shadows and hidden monsters lurking around every bend, I feel like the more appropriate description would probably be one that invokes Edward Gorey. It has the same macabre feeling, and the main character here is just as likely to suffer any number of brutal deaths.On top of that, Salt and Sanctuarys sounds do a tremendous job of adding to the overall sense of unease. And I dont just mean the sparse score, creepy though it may be. This is a game where every little sound, from the way barrels explode when you hit them to the sticky sounds of your sword running through the undead, adds to the ominous feel.Gameplay-wise, the game owes a clear debt to all sorts of Metroidvanias that have come before it  including, obviously, one half of the genres portmanteau, Castlevania. It doesnt build too much on your typical Metroidvania platformer, but I can say that it still finds a way of making use of the Vitas unique features, allowing you to use the touchscreen to quickly use items in your inventory. Obviously, thats far from unique, but its still a nice way of adapting to the handheld.For me, though, the biggest thing separating Salt and Sanctuary from Dark Souls is that its not quite as sadistic towards beginners. Whereas the Souls games are notoriously challenging for newcomers (at least in my experience), Salt and Sanctuary does a good of easing players into the difficulty. While early enemies are aggressive, and you need to space your attacks out to preserve energy, it never feels impossible. The game does an outstanding job of giving players an idea of whats in store, without making it so hard that less talented players are tempted to simply give up.", "date": "August 7, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
