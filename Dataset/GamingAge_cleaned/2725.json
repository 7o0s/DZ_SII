{"name": "Werewolf: The Apocalypse  Earthblood", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/03/werewolf-the-apocalypse-earthblood-review-for-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-xbox-one/", "text": "Werewolf: The Apocalypse  Earthblood starts off with a really flashy intro movie that is almost guaranteed to get you pumped up for the game. Wolves stalking around the screen, splashes of red against dark backgrounds, glistening fangs  even if youre not a fan of the tabletop game on which this is based (and Ill be honest, I didnt even know there was a werewolf tabletop game until I started playing this), its hard not to get sucked in.Unfortunately, that opening cinematic is also the games high point. Its all downhill from that point on.And its not even a gradual downhill. Right after you actually start the game and you see the first cutscene, its laughable how bad everything is. The characters look like they stepped out of a PS3 game (albeit a mostly above-average PS3 game). They move in the most bizarre ways imaginable, with lots of weird hand gestures  though, sadly, that movement doesnt extend to their faces. And when I say laughable, I mean it literally, because the dialogue made me laugh out loud  though Im not sure if I was laughing because it was so incredibly cheesy, or because the voice acting was so awful that I couldnt tell if it was people or a computer reading the script.It doesnt get any better once you get into the action, either. Your character, Cahal, is one of those titular werewolves, and he seems to spend all of his time either skulking around warehouses, either as a human or as a wolf, or going on rampages through those same warehouses, annihilating everything around him. It shouldnt surprise you to learn that both options are terrible, albeit in their own unique ways.Lets take the skulking. Cahal needs to be stealthy, for reasons that are only vaguely explained  and even then, he doesnt really need to be that stealthy, since the soldiers hes silently stalking have got to be some of the dumbest in the world. This is a game where you can kill them with a takedown and leave their bodies lying in plain sight, and no one will ever notice. The soldiers also have zero peripheral vision, since unless youre literally right in front of them, they wont notice you.Mind you, apart from certain sections where you have to be stealthy forreasons, in general you can also just turn into a werewolf and massacre everyone, and it wont make a huge difference. Theyll radio for backup, backup will arrive, youll kill everyone, and then youll go to the next room, where theyll be completely oblivious to the screaming and gunshots that happened one room over. You then kill everyone all over again.Now, Im not going to pretend its never fun to be an unstoppable killing machine, because theres a certain dumb charm the first few times you get to do that in Werewolf: The Apocalypse  Earthblood. The problem is its insanely repetitive, and your moves dont change all that much, no matter how many upgrades the game offers you.It also doesnt help that whenever you get into fights, youre battling just as much against lousy camera angles as you are opposing soldiers. Cahal has a fun lunge attack, except he moves faster than the camera, so its pretty common for you to be running back at enemies you cant see while the camera struggles to keep up. Writing this out, I realize that done well, this could actually have been an interesting way of showing action  but is there anything else in this review that makes you think Werewolf: The Apocalypse  Earthblood can do anything well?The sorta-good news about Werewolf: The Apocalypse  Earthblood is that it might just be one of those games thats so laughably bad and over-the-top stupid that its almost, kind of, in a wayfun. I wouldnt ever suggest paying full price for this game. I wouldnt even suggest buying it unless its down to well, well, well below $10 (or maybe even under $5). But if you can get it for, say, two or three dollars? Then the laughs youll get out of all of this nonsense might just be worth it.", "date": "March 1, 2021", "grade": "D-"}
