{"name": "The Invisible Hours", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/06/the-invisible-hours-review-for-xbox-one-ps4-pc/", "text": "If youre a glass half-full kind of person, you might look at The Invisible Hours as being an attempt at showing what video games can really do. Like Tacoma last year, the game is built around the recognition that, unlike any other medium, games take place in their own three-dimensional (or, if you count time as a dimension, four-dimensional) space, which opens up all kinds of narrative possibilities. Just because one action is happening in one part of a game world, it doesnt mean that other important actions cant be taking place simultaneously elsewhere. You can kind of see games like GTA or Just Cause hint at these possibilities, when you come across people doing weirdly random things, but games like The Invisible Hours and Tacoma really take it to its logical conclusion.In the case of The Invisible Hours, this means you get to watch a murder mystery unfold from multiple angles. Sure, you can just watch the detective doing his thing, trying to solve the case as he walks around the spooky mansion on an isolated island  but doing so means that you miss out on all the conversations and plans being hatched everywhere else at the same time. Luckily, you can rewind and fast-forward to make sure you dont miss anything  and, given all the little dramas unfolding at any given moment, those are controls that youll be making ample use of during your time with game. Basically, if youve ever read a mystery novel and wished you could know everything else thats happening as the story follows one plot strand or another, this game is the answer to your wish.At least, thats the optimistic way of looking at things.The more pessimistic  or, as I like think of it, the more realistic  way of looking at The Invisible Hours is that while the underlying idea is interesting, the game doesnt really do much with it. The murder youre trying to solve (that of Nikola Tesla, of all people) is kind of interesting at first, but the story suffers as it piles absurdity upon absurdity. Im not going to spoil who did it, or, more importantly, how, but I will say that the solution iskind of stupid, to be honest. Stupid in a way that probably shouldve been expected from a game thats built on the idea of Tesla being murdered in a spooky mansion on a deserted island where one of the prime suspects is Thomas Edison.Just to be clear, I have nothing against absurdity. Done right, it can be fun. But it requires a lot of other things to go right, and thats not what happens here. The voice acting is kind of mediocre, and the character animations are kind of ugly. In a game thats all about presentation, those things matter.I should probably expand on that last sentence, because it captures what I suspect many peoples biggest problem may be with the game. When say that The Invisible Hours is all about presentation, I mean that the game is literally presented to you. Youre just here as an idle observer. You can read letters or look more closely at objects, but nothing you do has any bearing on anything that unfolds in front of you. The closest you get to being a part of the action is when you happen to pick the correct person to follow just before a major plot point involving them takes place. Its not just that the game doesnt give you any agency, its that your agency in The Invisible Hours doesnt even exist, since youre not a character, nor are you influencing the characters.As I said to begin: the idea underlying The Invisible Hours is really cool, and its not hard to see how more could be done with it in the right hands. Unfortunately, thats just not the case here.", "date": "June 20, 2018", "grade": "C+"}
