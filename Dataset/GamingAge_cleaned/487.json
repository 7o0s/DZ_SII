{"name": "N++", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/06/n-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "From a purely aesthetic standpoint, N++ has a lot going for it. Its got flashy, brightly-coloured visuals that you can customize, and it has a pretty catchy electronic soundtrack. Given that it feels like lots of other twitch platformers seem to skimp on both aspects  since, after all, youre only going to be spending a few seconds in every level  its nice to find one that doesnt.Its also nice to see a game that offers so much in terms of selection: N++ boasts that it features more than 4,000 levels. Even if you only spend a few moments on each level, that still means youll be playing this for a good long while. Factor in the many, many deaths youll endure in every level, and its clear that this game isnt lacking in content.Of course, between the flashy visuals and the fun soundtrack and the crazy amount of levels, its easy to overlook the most important question: is N++ actually any good? And the answer to that is a resounding, enh, kinda, maybe?The problem lies in the fact that the games intention and its controls are fundamentally at odds with each other. On the one hand, you have thousands of bite-sized levels, all of them built around the idea that players will need lightning-fast reflexes in order to get by. On the other hand, N++s controls are woefully imprecise. Jumping is floaty. Your on-screen avatar has a tendency to glide along the ground after he lands, rather than coming to an immediate stop. Basically, imagine if someone tried grafting LittleBigPlanets jumping into Super Meat Boy, and then making the ground icy, and youd have a good idea of whats in store for players here.As you can imagine, it doesnt work so well.On top of that, N++ isnt always the most intuitive of games. Most of the levels feature obvious solutions, but every so often the game will throw in total headscratchers without giving you any kind of hint as to what youre supposed to do. I have nothing against trial and error, and the internets existence means its easy enough to find solutions if youre really stuck, but for a game that wants players to rely totally on intuition and muscle memory, its kind of weird to have levels that dont seem to make any sense. Its not a game-breaking flaw or anything, but it does seem like a weird design choice.Not as weird as floaty controls in a twitch platformer, mind you. Thats just baffling. Theres something to be said for making players figure out and adapt to your quirks, I guess  and if youre cool with that, then N++ has more than enough content to keep you occupied for weeks  but given the choice between a game that has solid controls and a game that doesnt, I dont know why you wouldnt pick the former every time.", "date": "June 28, 2018", "grade": "C+"}
