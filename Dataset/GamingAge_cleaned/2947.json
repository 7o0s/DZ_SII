{"name": "Potata: Fairy Flower", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/06/potata-fairy-flower-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "For the life of me, I cant figure out what it is about Potata: Fairy Flower that makes me feel so indifferent towards it.I mean, it looks pretty nice. The art style might be best described as Westernized Vanillaware, which basically means it borrows a little from games like Muramasa: Rebirth or Dragons Crown, except all the people  and particularly the games titular heroine  are dressed appropriately. Its not the most original-looking world, and nothing is going to wow you or jump off the screen, but Ive certainly played lots of games that look a whole lot worse.Likewise, as puzzle-platformers go, its mildly challenging. None of the puzzles are super hard, nor is any of the platforming, but when you mix them together, youll probably find that you die a reasonable number of times. Between the fact that Potata: Fairly Flower isnt meant to be some tough-as-nails platformer and the aforementioned kind graphics, thats probably the right difficulty level.Even the story and the humour are mildly engaging. The game follows a novice witch  the Potata of the title  as she saves her village from some evil and learns more about her powers along the way. Theres the odd joke along the way as she meets talking mushrooms and other fairy tale-worthy characters, but Id be lying if I ever said I laughed once. Still, it tries, and for the most part its kind of amusing.I think the problem is that even if Potata: Fairy Flower does a lot of things well enough, it doesnt do anything incredibly well. Even if, as I said, it looks better than plenty of other platformers  and, for that matter, its got more competent gameplay and a more engaging story than many of its competitors  there are also plenty more platformers that do all of those things much better than this game does. If you just want something thats good enough, itll do, but I feel like there are lots of other games out there that you should probably play first.", "date": "June 25, 2020", "grade": "B-"}
