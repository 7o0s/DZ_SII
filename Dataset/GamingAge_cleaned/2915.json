{"name": "Summer in Mara", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/08/summer-in-mara-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Ive always had a soft spot for games Id describe as Zelda-likes  that is, games that borrow heavily from The Legend of Zelda. Its weird, because Ive never been hugely into that venerable franchise, and yet I love games like Yonder and Oceanhorn.I was kind of hoping Summer in Mara would hit my personal sweet spot of kinda-not-quite Zelda. After all, the devs themselves namedropped Wind Waker when they launched its Kickstarter last year. Throw in a bit of farming simulation and some very pretty, brightly-coloured screenshots, and you can see why it might appeal to me.What I didnt count on was that Summer of Mara would bewell, bad. Or, to be charitable, mediocre and boring. Whichever way you want to look at it, its not a particularly fun game.Part of the problem is that the game seems to be missing a couple of key things. In fact, it seemed to be missing one of the most basic things, which is a plot. I played through the first day, carried out a few of the farming tasks (and Ill get to my complaints about those in a second), and went to sleep (since I couldnt figure out how else to save my progress), and when I went back to the game it seemed as though the game had skipped over something huge, since everything on the island was in ruins, and the main character, a young girl named Koa, seemed to have lost her grandmother. Clearly I missed something in there, though Ill assume that this experience wouldnt be universal.The obvious question, of course, is why didnt I just start over? The answer is simple: because the fetch quests on that first day are so mind-numbingly dull that I didnt want to have to relive them again. I dont have an inherent bias against repetitive tasks  done well, they can be delightfully zen  but the way theyre presented here, theyre boring beyond belief. Whether youre chopping down trees, clearing land, sowing seeds, watering plants, gathering berries, or whatever else the game has you do, it never has you carry out those tasks in a way that lends itself to getting into a groove. They always feel disjointed and awkward, so that youre constantly being reminded that youre doing boring busywork.Whats more, it never feels like youre doing the busywork for any reason other than to complete fetch quests. One of the weird joys of farming in games  at least when its done right  is figuring out the gameplay loop. Whether its Farming Simulator, or Yonder, or Stardew Valley, or whatever, part of the fun is getting into that groove and doing work for the sake of work. Here, you just do it because you met someone who needs X amount of a certain item, so you have to spend time growing the exact amount of resources that person needs before moving on to the next fetch quest, where the cycle repeats, but not in a way that feels interesting.It also doesnt help that Summer in Mara isnt really big on holding your hand in areas where it would actually be useful. Like, it tells you how to chop down a tree at great length, but when it comes time to, say, give you a mission marker or a minimap to help you figure out where to go, the game is mostly silent. If youre lucky, youll spot where the game wants you to go as youre wandering around aimlessly, but for the most part the game is defined by the way it tells you to go do something, but then doesnt give you any clue where youre supposed to go. Even on the smallest island at the games outset, the game will suddenly tell you you have to do something  whether its meet a random person, or go do a random task  but without a map or a visible marker, you have to run around the island until you stumble across whatever it is youre looking for.The most annoying part of Summer in Mara, though, is that it feels like it should be a lot better. Going by looks alone, its lovely. It nails that Wind Waker vibe, and if the game was better designed, it would be a joy to wander around its vibrant world.", "date": "August 5, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
