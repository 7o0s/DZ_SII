I know Im not the first person to say that, but it bears repeating. After all, funny is arguably the most subjective term there is; what one person finds hilarious, another may find terribly stupid or annoying. I mean, if there are people who dont think Portal 2 is funny (Im not saying it isnt, but odds are good theres someone that deluded out there), then its understandable why games generally shy away aiming for the funny bone.As youve probably guessed by now, Stick It To The Man is a funny game (or, at least, it wants to be one). Considering its genre  adventure and puzzles, with a little bit of platforming thrown in for good measure  this should hardly come as a surprise, as adventure games have generally been the exception to the whole games arent funny notion. Not only that, the game was penned by Adventure Time writer Ryan North (who is also responsible for one of the funniest things ever, the webcomic Dinosaur Comics), so its got a good pedigree from that perspective, too.So, does it succeed? Again, that comes down to subjective notions of funniness, but as far as Im concerned, for the most part it it does. I mean, its no Portal 2, but if thats the standard, then nothing would be. Stick It To The Man has a nice mix of jokes, ranging from (among many, many other things) oddly specific fortune cookies, to the main characters job being a hardhat tester, to a lobotomy-loving ghost, and more often than not, they stick.Of course, even if the game was the funniest thing ever made, the jokes wouldnt matter if the gameplay sucked. Thankfully, developers Zoink! realized this, and made sure that one of the games funnier aspects  the fact the main character has a giant pink hand sticking out of his head  also worked as one of the key game mechanics. You can use the hand to read peoples thoughts, grab important puzzle pieces, and jump up and down to particularly hard to reach places. Even if they missed out on the opportunity to incorporate the Vitas touchscreen capabilities into that mechanic, considering how well it all works, its hard to complain too much.On a similarly positive note, the graphics are fantastic, if a little dark at times. Much Tearaway, Stick It To The Man looks like it was pasted together with pieces of paper  though, at the same time, it looks nothing like Media Molecules GOTY candidate. Stick It To The Man inhabits a darker, murkier world, but at the same time, one thats still vibrant and alive in its own twisted way.", "date": "December 16, 2013", "grade": "A-"}
