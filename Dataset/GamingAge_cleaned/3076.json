{"name": "A Winters Daydream", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/02/a-winters-daydream-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Even though Im by no means a fan of visual novels, thanks to my Vita obsession Ive certainly played more than my fair share of them. And, based on that, I have a pretty good idea of what to expect when it comes to the genre. I know that, for the most part, youre basically just there to move the text forward and enjoy the story. There are some visual novels that help you to shape the story, but, just as frequently, youll find the games only ask that you read whats on the screen, and nothing more. Even by those very passive standards, however, A Winters Daydream seems particularly undemanding. Its a straightforward story with a beginning, and a middle, and an end, and for the most part, youre just getting three or so hours of static screens with text on them. Every so often the screen will shake or youll have some kind of minimal action, but for the most part, this game is a strict reading exercise.While I wouldnt say that the story here is engrossing, Ive certainly read worse. Because its so short, and because its so linear, it never goes wildly off-the-rails like so many other games in the genre are prone to do. (Though, admittedly, going wildly off-the-rails is what makes some of these games so enjoyable.). Youll be able to follow the plot without going through all kinds of non sequiturs and sudden changes of pace, which is pretty welcome. Also pretty welcome: the fact that the characters here are fairly decent people. Theyre pleasant to be around  which, considering the visual novel norm, is a nice change of pace. They seem thoughtful and rounded, rather than just being the usual stereotypes that populate a lot of these games.Whats more, theyre surprisingly non-pervy. After all, were talking about a plot where a young man, Yuu, returns home from his move to Tokyo, gets harangued by his sister for not having purchased her a bikini, flees to his grandmothers house, and then wakes up one morning and sees  and Im quoting from the games description here  that his grandmother has transformed into a cute young girl! If thats not the set-up for all kinds of uncomfortable incest jokes and innuendo, I dont know what is.  And yet, apart from one or two moments where people mistake Yuu and his grandmother for a couple, in general A Winters Daydream is a lot more sentimental than anything else. Its a heartfelt, earnest story of a young man reconnecting with a grandmother whos grieving the loss of her husband, and who uses that as motivation to rebuild his relationship with his sister as he realizes the fleeting nature of life. To his credit, Yuu is the kind of person who reflects on what he experiences before he reacts, which is a nice character trait to see, in fiction and in real life.", "date": "February 10, 2020", "grade": "B+"}
