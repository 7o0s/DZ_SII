Protocol is like the opposite of that: its so obnoxious that you cant help but hate everything about it.Some of this, I think, is by design. Its a self-described sci-fi comedy thats heavy on self-aware humour, so its kind of intentionally obnoxious. Intentional or not, though, that still means the game is pretty obnoxious. Likewise, Protocol also commits the sin of thinking that just because it makes fun of itself for adhering to basic tropes, that somehow absolves it of the fact that its still adhering to those tropes  which is almost never the case.Moreover, it also means that Protocol feels very much like an in your face 90s game  witness, for example, the fact that one of the controls is for your character to give the finger. That may have been fine if it were 25 years ago and youre trying to be shocking, but now it just feels dated.The bigger problem with Protocol, though, is that the gameplay is terrible.Mostly, I suspect, this is because Protocol started life as a VR game, and the transition to being a regular console game wasnt done with a whole lot of care. The controls feel clunky, and picking up items  which may be the most common thing you go here, especially early on  is always a massive pain. Youre constantly dropping objects, and not in a Surgeon Simulator, this game is intentionally tough/broken kind of way. Rather, its because the controls are unintentionally brutal, and constantly getting in the way of the game being playable.It also doesnt help that the whole game is built around killing you off every time you dont follow instructions. This seems kind of interesting the first few times you die, in a meta sort of way, as a commentary on how we follow rules in gameand then you realize that happens every single step of the way, and it suddenly becomes more tiresome than clever. To go back to a point I made above, it doesnt really matter if a game is making fun of tropes if its still slavishly adhering to them.", "date": "June 24, 2021", "grade": "D"}
