{"name": "ScourgeBringer", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/07/scourgebringer-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "As the clock ticks down on the Vitas remaining releases (thanks to Sony cutting off developers from releasing new games for the system on July 20th), Ive been trying to avoid playing and reviewing them for as long as possible. Even though the Switch has surpassed it as my go-to primary gaming platform, Ive played a lot of games on the Vita over the past nine years, and a not-insignificant part of me is sad to see it ride off into the sunset.That said, its kind of remarkable that a platform thats been as derided and ignored as the Vita is still getting new games in 2021, nearly a decade after it was first released. Whats more, thanks to ScourgeBringer, we can say that its getting good games this late in its lifespan (as opposed to, say, its swan song being one of the worst games ever made).Because seriously: ScourgeBringer is an exceptionally good game, made even better by the fact its on the Vita. And Im not just saying that because of my love for the handheld, either  the game is one of the few to ever make use of the systems rear touchpad, and it does so in a way that makes sense, as you use it to fire bullets at your enemies. Even if Ive rarely liked the rear touchpad, it makes sense here given the sheer number of enemies onscreen at any given time.Beyond that, though, ScourgeBringer makes sense on the Vita (and probably on the Switch, for that matter) because of the nature of its gameplay. Its a roguelike Metroidvania where youre constantly battling through room after room of never-ending monsters. Its the sort of game where, immediately after dying, youll want to go back and do it again, just to see what it throws at you next. Being able to take the game with you only adds into that feeling.And you will die a lot, by the way. Every room features wave after wave of monsters, and you dont have a whole lot of HP to sustain you. All you can do is continuously attack everything that moves, and hope you can kill all the monsters before they can kill you. (You wont, of course, but its a mark of how fun the combat is that youll still keep trying.)Its also worth noting that ScourgeBringer looks amazing. Theres nothing specific to the Vita about that, though  Im just saying that the developers seemed to use every colour at their disposal when they designed these worlds, and the results cant help but stand out.But, really, everything about ScourgeBringer stands out. Its a phenomenal game thats made it onto one of my favourite platforms of all time, and if youre one of the few people still playing games on the Vita in 2021  or if youre playing it anywhere else, really  its unquestionably a great addition to your library.", "date": "July 22, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
