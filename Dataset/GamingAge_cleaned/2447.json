Further, they tend not to be of the greatest quality. So even if it doesnt appear that The Smurfs  Mission Vileaf was released to piggyback off a broader marketing campaign, I can see why some (if not most) people might approach it with skepticism.But the truth is, its a decent game. Its very easy, and its very much geared towards a younger audience, but as long as you remember those two basic and intertwined facts, The Smurfs  Mission Vileaf doesnt seem so bad.To be sure, its a pretty standard collectathon 3D platformer. The Smurfs village is being threatened by Gargamel and the toxic plant he created  the titular vileaf  and to combat that, Smurfette, Hefty Smurf, Brainy Smurf and Chef Smurf take turns cleaning up the mess he created. Gameplay doesnt differ all that much between the different smurfs, and for the most part youre just going around cleaning plants, with the odd enemy thrown in here and there to mix things up.But what The Smurfs  Mission Vileaf lacks in inspiration, it makes up for in being generally competent. The platforming is solid (even if it there are only a few sections involving bouncy mushrooms that will challenge you), the basic mechanics work, and outside of a few cutscenes where the graphics seem to take a hit, the game generally performs okay. Theres also full voice acting, which is a bonus  though, at the same time, youll likely be sick of hearing the word Smurf before too long.Clearly, as 3D platformers go, The Smurfs  Mission Vileaf isnt exactly going to make anyone forget Super Mario Odyssey. In fact, its not likely to make anyone forget New Super Luckys Tale. But if you  or, more likely, the young children in your life  are after a game that will provide a few hours of entertainment, you could certainly do a lot worse.", "date": "January 11, 2022", "grade": "B"}
