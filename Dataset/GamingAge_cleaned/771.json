{"name": "Batman: The Enemy Within  Episode 1 The Enigma", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/08/batman-enemy-within-episode-1-enigma-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "The brutal, visceral permanence of Telltales Batman in the first season stunned and hooked me from the beginning. Unlike the Telltale games before it, Batman had characters that I had grown up with, personalities that I had spent years of my adolescence learning from and growing to appreciate. Telltale took those characters and put their fate into my hands. Dealing with Selena, Harvey, Gordon and Alfred felt surreal, and knowing that the choices you make have sometimes devastating and permanent consequences on the way that their stories play out is both addicting and terrifying.Gotham is a world that lends itself to Telltale in a very symbiotic way. The art style and storytelling of the source material, which spans decades and dozens of timelines makes for a great choose your own adventure style story, while the gameplay style and narrative mechanics of a Telltale game make for an in-depth and thoroughly enjoyable comic book ride. Season One set the tone and the precedent for what to expect, and the first episode of Season Two delivers on all fronts.The Enemy Within brings an unfamiliar iteration of a familiar villain to the forefront in the form of The Riddler. Sure, there are plenty of different takes on The Riddler but most of them showcase him as a deranged genius intent on proving that he is smarter than Batman. He thrives on puzzles and mental challenges, if people are hurt in the process, so be it, but he rarely goes out of his way to brutalize his victims. Telltales version of The Riddler however is much more akin to The Joker than most versions, with The Riddler presenting himself as a brutal and violent villain, intent on hurting people for the sake of hurting them, with his personal mental battle with The Bat playing second fiddle. He carries around a Scythe in the shape of a question mark, leaving no doubt that he is a new force to be reckoned with.The Enemy Within doesnt delve as far into The Riddler as I would have liked for an episode that seemed like it would be so focused on him, but it definitely set the rest of the season up for plenty depth from the character. The true highlight of this episode is the supporting cast, with the relationship between Bruce Wayne and a terribly broken Alfred playing the most memorable role to me. Depending on the outcome of your personal Season One, you may have a very different experience, but to me that relationship played a pivotal role in creating the Batman that you see by the end of the first episode.", "date": "August 9, 2017", "grade": "A"}
