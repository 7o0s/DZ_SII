{"name": "Super Arcade Football", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/11/super-arcade-football-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "Given that FIFA has basically abandoned the Switch in recent years  since no, Legacy Editions dont count  its opened the door for indie developers to fill that void with their own takes on the beautiful game. Super Arcade Football is one such entry, and even if its clearly not as polished as what youd get from EA, it more than makes up for that by being an absolute blast.It does this by being as pick-up-and-play as a soccer game can be. Theres the thumbstick to move your players, one button to pass and shoot, andthats literally it. You dont need to figure out the difference between a lob pass and a through pass, no complicated corner kick strategies, no keeping track of players health and stamina. It took a few moments to get used to playing a sports game that had so few controls, but once I caught onto what was expected of me, I was addicted.It also helps that, true to the arcade part of its title, Super Arcade Football is fast-paced, and doesnt require you to sink endless amounts of time into squad management, or practice, or even games themselves  the halves in single-player mode are three minutes each, which means everything flies by at a pleasantly quick pace.Theres also a decent amount of content and customization to be found here. You can play around with the playing conditions for exhibition games, play online, set up tournaments, and, best of all, play a story mode that doesnt venture too far away from play a bunch of games. Its not exactly incredibly deep, but theres enough to do here that youll feel like youre getting your moneys worth.Is it on par with FIFAs production values? Of course not: its an indie-made, retro-tinged soccer game. But simply by making soccer feel fun and fast-moving, Super Arcade Football is a worthy entry into the Switchs crowded soccer field.", "date": "November 12, 2021", "grade": "A-"}
