Unfortunately for it, Ive now played Wurroom, and by comparison literally everything else seems completely normal.You may think Im exaggerating, but Im not. In Wurroom, you play  and I use that term very, very loosely  as a hand. You press around the screen on objects made of clay for 10 to 15 minutes, a bunch of random stuff happens, and then a screen pops up telling you youve experienced everything the game has to offer. The end.Trying to describe what goes on during those 15 minutes is an exercise in futility, because none of it makes sense. Its more like a series of disconnected images thrown together in a really trippy dream. You pick up a shovel and place it on a giant forehead. A giant mouth comes from the bottom of the screen and eats a shoelace thats anchoring a floating island. Theres a cutscene of sorts that seems to show an alien reporter doing a broadcast from in front of a statue. A giant Easter Island head statue watches TV, then a fish climbs out of his brain. A bunch of masks congregate, one swallows the hand, and spits it into a heart.I may have gotten the order wrong. Even with its short runtime, I still managed to lose track of what was happening, and Im trying to piece it together after the fact. Its quite possible that theres a story there and Im just not smart enough to get it. Or maybe it isnt meant to be understood.", "date": "July 16, 2020", "grade": "B"}
