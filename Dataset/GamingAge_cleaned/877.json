{"name": "The Walking Dead: A New Frontier Above the Law", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/04/walking-dead-new-frontier-law-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Its been a bit, but Telltales The Walking Dead: A New Frontier Episode 3 is finally out. Dubbed Above the Law, this episode deals quickly with the ramifications of Javier and crew discovering that Javiers brother David is still alive and well, and apparently a key figure with the New Frontier group. Keep in mind, this is the same group responsible for destroying Prescott and killing Mariana, Davids daughter.I was pretty surprised with how quickly things escalate in Above the Law. Without going into heavy spoilers, David walks a real fine line between unlikable jerk and caring family member, in a way that makes a number of decisions kind of tough here. This is certainly when Telltale games are at their best, when you have to struggle with the decisions on hand, bouncing between moral righteousness and flatout revenge. And theres a hefty amount of that decision making in episode 3.On the flip side, this entry is pretty light on player interaction. Youll have plenty of dialogue choices, and a bit of action, but no real exploring or movement that isnt controlled by the game. While The Walking Dead has never really been about exploration, I still enjoy when the game gives you a moment or two to check out your surroundings. And considering the new locale featured in this episode, I thought wed get a bit more of that. This isnt a huge negative for me, but still a little surprising.", "date": "April 3, 2017", "grade": "B+"}
