{"name": "Dragons Crown Pro", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/05/dragons-crown-pro-review-for-ps4/", "text": "So while were still sort of left hanging on an actual Dragons Crown sequel, Atlus is set to release a PS4 version of the original game on May 16th, dubbed Dragons Crown Pro. This is a newly spruced up version of the original PS3/Vita release, with a few bells and whistles to pull in both those that played the hell out of the game before, and new players alike.All in all, its a solid port / upscale of the original Vanillaware developed RPG. This version boasts 4k support for PS4 Pro users, but even your regular PS4 owners will benefit from improved visuals, a generally rocksteady framerate, and a new orchestral rendition of the soundtrack (which can be toggled between the original score). Other features include online and couch co-op, which supports any mix of players between the two. Youll also have both English and Japanese language tracks, crossplay support for PS3/Vita versions of the game, and the ability to import your old saves from the cloud, which works flawlessly.For how the game actually plays, especially if youre not one that experienced the original release, Im going to cheat and point you in the direction of Aarons original review of the game. Id say his thoughts and impressions still hold true here, and I dont have much to expand upon.", "date": "May 8, 2018", "grade": "A-"}
