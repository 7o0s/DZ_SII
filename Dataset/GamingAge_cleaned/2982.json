{"name": "Random Heroes: Gold Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2020/05/random-heroes-gold-edition-review-for-ps4-ps-vita-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Random Heroes is very much a game that prides itself on quantity. As it proudly notes, it includes more than 100 levels, and you can unlock up to 28 playable characters. On top of that, you earn lots and lots of coins from every one of the many enemies you kill that explodes in a shower of coins, which you use to buy any number of guns. Theres a lot of stuff here, is what Im saying.Unfortunately, the quality isnt anywhere near as abundant. The levels are all basically the same, with only minor variations in the background here and there to let you know youve moved from, say, the city world to the sewer world  and even then, they dont change all that much. Likewise, while the heroes all have different stats when it comes to health, damage, and speed, they dont vary so much that youll need to change them up between levels. The guns, too, differ in the amount of damage they dealbut not so much that any of them feel all that different.Mind you, this could be because nearly all of the enemies are bullet sponges. Sure, the bosses take more shots, obviously, and there are little flying enemies that you can dispatch in two or three shots, but for the most part, every level features you standing in front of enemies, firing endless amounts of shots into them until they pay out. Like, I unlocked a bazooka, which said it had maximum damage, and even that took at least four or five shots to kill standard enemies. Whats more, the enemies are generally pretty stupid, and can only run back and forth, so its mainly just a matter of shooting, jumping away when they get too close, and then returning to finish the job as soon as they turn away.Really, if youve ever played any run & gun platformer, youve experienced what Random Heroes has to offer. Just about the only difference here is that theres more of it than youd find than in most places. If you value quantity of a game above all else, then it might do the trick, but otherwise I dont see why youd bother with it.", "date": "May 19, 2020", "grade": "C"}
