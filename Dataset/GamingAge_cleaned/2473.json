{"name": "Worlds End Club", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/12/worlds-end-club-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "On paper, Worlds End Club sounds like a cant-miss prospect. Its a post-apocalyptic game about kids trying to root out a traitor made by two guys who know how to make that scenario work  Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka, who played key roles in the creation of the Zero Escape and Danganronpa series, respectively. If thats not the recipe for success, I dont know what is.And yet, somehow, Worlds End Club misses.Whats more, its not hard at all to see why it misses: it feels like a watered-down version of its creators other games. Just have to look at the ESRB rating: its rated T, whereas games like Zero Escape and Danganronpa had well-deserved M ratings. Im not saying that edgy games are inherently better, or that swearing and violence are more interestingbut Im not saying theyre not not better either, especially if were talking about games like Danganronpa and Zero Escape. Trying to turn those games into something that fits into a T rating leads to  well, it leads to a game like Worlds End Club.Part of the issue with that is that you constantly get reminded of those other games, and Worlds End Club just cant measure up. Where Danganronpa had the Ultimate students trapped at a school where they met their grisly ends, Worlds End Club has the Go-Getters Club, a group of tween (for the most part) students stuck at an amusement park. Where Danganronpa had Monokuma, the homicidal bear who saw everything and was a source of cuddly evil, Worlds End Club has Pielope, a malevolent, homicidal clown/fairy who chimes in regularly, especially during the first chapter. The Danganronpa students had to best each other in constant trials to save themselves from death, the Worlds End Club gang are trapped in the Game of Fate, where they have to follow directions on wristbands to avoid being murdered.Theres also the fact that Zero Escape and Danganronpa were mostly visual novels, whereas Worlds End Club is more like a very talkative puzzle-platformer. You read long, boring exposition from one-dimensional students, and then  especially after the first chapter  you switch over to a pretty basic platformer where you occasionally need to solve puzzles. Compared to those other games, that constantly built up tension, Worlds End Club feels oddly unfocused.If Worlds End Club existed in a vacuum  or even in a world where neither Danganronpa or Zero Escape didnt exist  it might seem a little more interesting. The premise is solid, and theres nothing inherently objectionable about the gameplay, its just not incredibly interesting since weve seen it done so much better elsewhere. But thats precisely the problem  its been done much, much better, and those games are all still quite available, with the Danganronpa trilogy slated to arrive on the Switch in a few weeks. Youre better old holding out for that, rather than wasting your time with this pale imitation.", "date": "December 8, 2021", "grade": "C-"}
