You even get a trophy for beating the game in under six minutes, which should tell you all you need to know about the amount of content. Consequently, the games reception has beennot great, to put it mildly.But heres the second-most important thing you need to know about 36 Fragments of Midnight: its really not that bad.I wouldnt say its a GOTY centender or anything. And I could definitely see how some people might see it as more a concept for a game than an actual game. Besides the brevity, theres no plot beyond find the 36 fragments. The gameplay is your basic platforming, with the only wrinkle being that the world is procedurally-generated. And thats quite literally all there is to the game, since, again, it can be beaten in under six minutes.I prefer, however, to take a more glass half-full approach to 36 Fragments of Midnight. Sure, its replay value is limited once you get beyond the platinum, but for that hour or so youre playing it, its perfectly enjoyable. The levels present a decent enough challenge, with the procedurally-generated aspect introducing a fun wrinkle to the proceedings. And, most importantly, the controls are easy to pick up and work just as tightly as they need to.Again, its nowhere near perfect. But for what it is, and for the (cheap) price it is, there are much worse gaming ways to pass the time than 36 Fragments of Midnight.", "date": "December 18, 2017", "grade": "B"}
