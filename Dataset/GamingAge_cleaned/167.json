{"name": "Bird Game +", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/06/bird-game-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "Bird Game + is one of the more frustrating games Ive played in awhile  and not just because of what it is, but also because you can see the vast gap between that and what it aspires to be.See, Bird Game+ is basically an endless runner. True, you play as a bird, and youre flying through nature, but the gist of the game will be familiar to anyone whos ever played an endless runner on their phone: you avoid obstacles, and you just try to go forward for as long as you can.As I said up top, the problems with this are two-fold. First and foremost, its not a particularly fun game. The bird feels slow and clunky, and doesnt move with any of the grace youd associate with most birds in flight. Getting from one side of the screen is an arduous process, and you constantly feel like youre fighting with the controls to get the bird to move where you want it to go. It also doesnt help matters that, despite the nature setting, youre essentially flying through a tunnel, and anytime you get to the edge of where youre allowed to fly, you just stop moving in that direction.In this respect, Bird Game + also isnt helped much by its camera, which frequently takes the least helpful angles possible, and makes it hard to judge where you are in relation to where the game wants you to go. There are also random boss fights thrown in to shake things up a bit, but the reality is that even in these, youre fighting as much against the lousy controls as you are your enemies.The other part of what makes Bird Game + so frustrating is that you can plainly see it aspires to be so much more. Its an artsy game where you watch as the world is drawn in front of you, and with all the motion  both of the bird and the world around it  it seems like its trying to evoke games like Flower. Unfortunately, coupled with the half-baked controls and a lousy camera, the end result feels less like an artistic experience and more like a partially-finished game that doesnt do what it sets out to do.In fact, its because of the existence of games like Flower or Entwined that Bird Game + goes from merely frustrating to outright disappointing. Theres a template for how this sort of thing could have been done correctly  and more often than not, Bird Game + misses the mark entirely.", "date": "June 5, 2019", "grade": "D+"}
