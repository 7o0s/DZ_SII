With Pinball FX3, you now have access to more great tables, as well as Switch exclusive features not found on other versions.Zen Pinball 2 did appear on the Wii U at one point, although unlike other platforms there appears to be no way to import previous purchases from that platform to Pinball FX3 (yet at least), so for now youll be shelling out more cash to collect them again. Also, many tables that do appear on other platforms do not appear to be available on the Switch as of this review. You still get most of the Zen Studios created tables as well as all of the Universal Studios Tables I reviewed for the Xbox One (You can read about those here).Two new tables are debuting on the Nintendo Switch version, (soon to be available on other platforms) they are Adventure Land and Son of Zeus. Adventure Land takes you on a trip to old carnivals of the 50s and 60s, featuring a design based on classic rides and sideshow attractions. This table has more of a classic feel, as there are very few bells and whistles when compared to other outings. Still, a very fun table that is easy to enjoy.Son of Zeus features something Ive never seen in a pinball simulator, dynamic weather, that actually affects the ball, and even the flippers. You take down mythical creatures, such as the Hydra and Medusa, in a quest to get to the top of Mount Olympus all the while dealing with changing play field conditions. It was really fun to play and very high scoring. Some of the best effects Ive ever seen on a Pinball FX table.I mentioned Switch exclusive features, and this mostly pertains to the console being both a TV console and a portable console. In tablet mode, you can actually switch the orientation of any table to a long way view and see the entire table on the screen while you control the plunger and flippers with the left joycon. You can leave the joycon attached and use the face buttons, or remove it and use the L and R and analog stick. Of course you will have to find a way to prop up your Switch console if you play this way, since to my knowledge there is no vertical stand for the console available, but its still great that the developers made this with the system in mind and didnt just hastefully port it over!Just like on other platforms, The Pinball FX3 platform delivers a great pinball experience without costing you an arm and a leg. Combine that with the new challenge modes, multiplayer and the Switch exclusive options and you have yourself a great package for pinball fans and casual players alike. This app is a perfect fit for the Nintendo Switch and is a great addition to the ever growing library! Even if you already have this on another platform, the Switch version is fantastic. I highly recommend it!", "date": "December 20, 2017", "grade": "A"}
