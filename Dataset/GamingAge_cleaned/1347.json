{"name": "The Bridge", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2015/08/the-bridge-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-wii-u/", "text": "If aesthetics were everything, The Bridge would be a pretty strong Game of the Year contender. After all, its basically an M.C. Escher sketch come to life. Its all lines that curve into each other, and bridges that look like optical illusions, and arches that should be physically impossible. Not only that, every single screen looks like it was lovingly hand drawn in pencil  which, considering the game was designed by a two-person team, may not be that far from the truth.Of course, aesthetics arent everything in games. They need to have gameplay that lives up to the graphics, or else you just have a bunch of nice-looking pictures. And on that front, Im not sure that The Bridge quite delivers.I mean, were not talking about a gap between graphics and gameplay on the order of, er, The Order. The Bridge is simply an unassuming puzzle game that cant seem to find the right level of difficulty. Half the time the puzzles are really easy, and dont require very much brainpower to solvebut then youll suddenly run into one that seems to border on impossible, and youre stuck playing around with gravity for several minutes until your little puzzle-solving man suddenly finds himself in front of the door that exits the level.Its possible, mind you, that those uncharacteristically difficult levels still reveal one of the games strengths, which is that its got controls that are pretty easy to get the hang of. Press the right shoulder button and the screen tilts right, and the left shoulder button tilts it  you guessed it  left. Throw in a rewind button to erase your mistakes and another one to invert the screen, and youve pretty much discovered all there is to know. That may make those infuriating levels even more infuriating (since half the time its all just a matter of trial and error), but at the same time, it means youre never fiddling around trying to do the impossible.", "date": "August 28, 2015", "grade": "B"}
