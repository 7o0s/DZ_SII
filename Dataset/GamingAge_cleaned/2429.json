{"name": "I Love Finding Cats!  Collectors Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/02/i-love-finding-cats-collectors-edition-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Good news for anyone who goes into I Love Finding Cats! hoping that the game delivers on its titular promise: there are many cats to be found. At least three per level, in fact, in addition to various puzzles also featuring pictures of cats.As someone who does, indeed, love finding cats, I have to admit: this game got me in a way few others do.Mind you, seeing as I Love Finding Cats! is a hidden object game, thats pretty much the bare minimum of what the game should do. It would be kind of disappointing  if not relatively shocking  if the game couldnt shoehorn in cats by the litterful.Thankfully, though it does. Whats more, it finds ways to keep the cat-themed content fresh. You have the usual hidden object scenes  where, to be clear, you have to find a lot more than just cats  but you also have jigsaw puzzles, puzzles where you rotate the pieces, puzzles where you swap pieces, spot the difference puzzles, and more. Cats are featured in all of them.Just about the only drawback that could be applied to I Love Finding Cats! is that theres nothing linking all the puzzles together. Its not like the games are improved by having a shoehorned-in narrative (like, I know that Faircrofts Antiques had a story, but I couldnt tell you what it was), but if you want one, you wont find it here.Then again, the point of the game is right in the name: youre supposed to find cats. If thats all you want out of I Love Finding Cats!, then youll probably be very, very pleased with what you find here.", "date": "February 3, 2022", "grade": "B-"}
