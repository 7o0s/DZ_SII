{"name": "The Sun and Moon", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/05/sun-moon-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Just because you have an innovative idea, it doesnt necessarily mean that its a good innovative idea. Want proof? Look no further than The Sun and Moon.Before I go any further, of course, I should note that Im not particularly good at the game. Though Ive gotten through many (though not all) of the levels, its taken me a long time to do so. Beating each one requires a whole lot of trial and error (and error, and error, and error), and Ive come nowhere close to meeting most target times. As such, when I say Im not fond of it, be aware that a lot of that is built-up frustration speaking.In my defense, however, I have a hard time seeing how else anyone could experience the game. It is, after all, a physics-based platformer, with the core mechanic  which calls for players to play with gravity by diving into the ground and launching themselves towards other platforms  seemingly being designed in such a way that you have no choice but to experiment every step of the way. There doesnt seem to be any hard and fast rule for how far youre going to dive or be launched, which pretty much every single jump you take is almost literally a leap of faith. Maybe I just played it the wrong way, but it feels like the game is designed in such a way that if you get through a level on your first try, its because you got incredibly lucky.If The Sun and Moon has one saving grace, its one that you actually dont even need the game to experience. See, its score is gorgeous, all cold and sparse and minimalisticand, as luck would have it, its available as a separate download via Bandcamp. I know that, as a gaming site, we should probably be in the business of promoting games over other forms of media. In this case, however, that other form of media is not just clearly better, but also roughly the same cost, which means that, as far as Im concerned, its pretty clear which one deserves your money.", "date": "May 25, 2016", "grade": "C"}
