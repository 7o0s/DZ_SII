{"name": "Deep Space Rush", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/11/deep-space-rush-review-for-ps-vita-ps4-xbox-one-switch/", "text": "A quick synopsis of my time with Deep Space Rush: I played it for a little while, I checked how close I was to the Platinum, I attempted to go back to the game only to have it crash a bunch of times, I rebuilt my Vitas database, I redownloaded the game and started over from scratch, and I got the Platinum. Based on that whole ordeal, I feel wholly qualified to make two observations about it:I mean, it wouldnt have sucked quite as much. It just would have been an ultra-repetitive run & gun shooter with nothing particularly distinctive about it. The crashes just made it so that it was a broken ultra-repetitive run & gun shooter with nothing particularly distinctive about it.The gist of Deep Space Rush is that you have to go on to a spaceship, shoot everything you can until you die, and use whatever coins you pick up along the way to upgrade your weapons. Then you repeat that, trying to beat your own high score.And thats it. The weapons are interchangeable, the levels are mostly the same, and the enemies are only serve as nondescript obstacles for you to shoot. The whole game looks like it could have come out at some point in the late 80s or early 90s, but given the plethora of games that also fit that description  from then and now  thats hardly a distinctive point in its favour.In fact, just about the only reason Ill even remember Deep Space Rush is because it was a massive pain to get that last trophy. When being broken is the only memorable thing about a game, thats probably a good sign you can  and should  give it a hard pass.", "date": "November 26, 2019", "grade": "F"}
