{"name": "The Longest Five Minutes", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/10/the-longest-five-minutes-review-for-nintendo-switch-ps-vita/", "text": "At first, The Longest Five Minutes seems like its going to be a completely new take on the JRPG formula: it runs through the entire storys narrative in a couple of cutscenes before dropping you right into the final boss battle  where, inconveniently, the games hero (appropriately named Flash Back) is struck with amnesia, and has forgotten everything thats brought him to that point. The game then tells its story in a series of flashbacks, every so often jumping ahead to the final battle when Flash remembers something new.Its an interesting way of telling a story that has been basically told countless times before by all kinds of other RPGs of all stripes. Unfortunately, its also the games lone moment of inspiration, as you quickly discover that everything else here falls somewhere between boring and generic.First, the generic: the plot. If theres one thing that JRPG designers love, its a story about a group of teens who are tasked with saving the world from a demon. You get that same story here, and theres nothing about the way that its told thats even remotely interesting.As for the boringwell, pretty much everything else. You basically wander around a forgettable map, looking for points of interest and getting drawn into lots of forgettable battles at random moments. The good news is that the battles have an auto option  but thats also bad news for the game, since it means that you can zip through every battle without having to think about any of them for a second. Im not going to complain about the option too long or too loudly, since figuring out how to properly manage my parties in turn-based battles has long been one of my Achilles heels, but the novelty of the thing wears off kind of quickly.And one it does, theres not much to do but wait for the flash-forwards to reveal the games ending. Its a shame, because The Longest Five Minutes starts off so well  but, at the same time, it makes the title oddly ironic, since the five or so minutes in which the game seems genuinely interesting and fresh are over far, far too quickly.", "date": "October 11, 2018", "grade": "C+"}
