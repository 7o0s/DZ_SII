I absolutely urge anyone interested in Monster Hunter: World to play the game though, because I do think its great. But youll still be hit with a number of small learning barriers in your first few hours that have pretty much been present throughout the series. So if youve picked up a Monster Hunter game in the past decade, played about an hour, and then decided that it wasnt for you, theres a good chance youll have a similar feeling here.That said, I do LOVE this game. There have been a number of small improvements that have simplified certain aspects of the overall game, but I think those are more noticeable to longtime players and less so to newcomers. Hopefully youve already tried the game out via one of the few beta demos on the PS4 over the past month or so, which at least does a good job of getting you accustomed to combat. If you enjoyed those sessions, then I dont think theres anything else about Monster Hunter: World that youll have a tough time figuring out.Given half a chance, heres what I think youll enjoy about Monster Hunter: World on PS4 and Xbox One.For starters, it looks pretty darn good. Like I mentioned before, this is the first big console release for Monster Hunter in a good, long while, at least over here in the West. The 3DS was generally the home to the series over past few years, and it worked out pretty well there, but boy oh boy these visuals really help to drive home the appeal of hunting down and fighting giant monsters. Its also nice having a standard controller, which helps a bit when it comes to inventory management, especially when out in the field.Another big plus is that Monster Hunter: World is a brand-new game, and not some sort of enhanced port. This is a new adventure, a new story, with new zones to check out. Theres definitely repeated content via monsters and weapons, but even those have slight additions or changes helping make Monster Hunter: World feel like a fresh experience for everyone. I personally dig the new maps, theyre super detailed, have some degree of verticality, and also contain a surprising number of interactive elements that can trigger during battles.Going back to combat, which is definitely one of the more defining aspects for Monster Hunter as a whole, Monster Hunter: World is extremely satisfying. Regardless of which weapon you end up selecting, everything has weight and power to it. Smacking a monster with the Great Sword or Hammer feels and looks outstanding, and even shots fired from ranged weapons have a remarkable amount of heft and impact built into their animation and sound. Likewise, seeing monsters interact with each other in the field is a spectacle unto itself, and will lead to numerous screenshots and gifs in the coming months.As far as additions and tweaks go, the use of Scoutflies in Monster Hunter: World feels like a pretty big deal. In previous Monster Hunter games, when you would spot a monster you could toss a paintball at it in order to mark it on the map temporarily. Paintballs are now gone, instead youll track a monster throughout the map using Scoutflies, which will highlight monster footprints, feathers, or other markings. Once youve gathered enough of those markings, the Scoutflies will then helpfully pinpoint where a monster is, and will keep track of them until a battle is finished. Scoutflies are also useful for highlighting resources, which helps a lot considering how detailed the environments are.Multiplayer has always been a big component in the Monster Hunter series, and so far I feel like Monster Hunter: World represents that fact well. Playing prior to release I havent run into a lot of online players, but in the few instances where I have teamed up with others, everything has run smoothly. You can definitely play offline if you choose to, but creating or joining an online lobby will pair you up with 16 players total, allowing you to run around your hub with other players, make 4-player parties, and socialize via actual voice chat or in-game chat options and emotes. Its not groundbreaking by any means, but helps make the overall world feel lived in when you encounter other hunters in the wild, and allows for larger groups of friends to get together with various privacy options.", "date": "January 25, 2018", "grade": "A+"}
