{"name": "Distraint 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/05/distraint-2-review-for-ps4/", "text": "Distraint 2 isnt what youd call subtle. After all, its a psychological horror game about the horrors of capitalism where you play as a man named Price and encounter other characters named Reason and Greed. All thats missing are a few overly detailed, overly explained pictures that double as heavily strained metaphors, and the game would practically be an old-timey political cartoon.The problem with Distraint 2 isnt thats heavy-handed, however. Rather, its that its not all that different from the first Distraint. To be fair, of course, thats not the worst thing in the world. To the extent it was possible with its dark subject matter, I actually enjoyed Distraint (though I regrettably didnt review it). Even with its heavy-handedness, it still made you care about Price and his struggles as he slowly lost his humanity in the pursuit of a better position and better pay. It told the story well within its limitations, with pixel-y graphics and simple puzzles, and it knew how to draw you in.Distraint 2 basically just repeats that formula, with the only difference that this time hes trying to find a bit of peace of mind. Its not a huge departure from the first game, and it really only makes incremental improvements  which means its a little nicer-looking, the puzzles are a little harder, and the game is a little longer.Ultimately, though, Distraint 2 doesnt offer much that you couldnt have gotten out of the first game. If you missed that first game, then that may make this one a little more interesting, but if you played it and enjoyed it, be aware youre not getting that much more out of this one.", "date": "May 10, 2021", "grade": "B"}
