{"name": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme VS-Force", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/09/mobile-suit-gundam-extreme-vs-force-review-ps-vita/", "text": "In theory, Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme VS-Force should be awesome. After all, its giant robots battling it out over ruined cities with bombs and lasers. While Ive admittedly never seen the anime on which the game is based, I feel like the mere existence of giant fighting robots should, by itself, be enough to make any game worthwhile.Turns out its not even remotely close. I mean, maybe my experience with the game is severely limited by my lack of familiarity with the subject matter, but it feels like the entire Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme VS-Force  which feels like it should have a much easier acronym  experience can be summed up with the adjectives loud, flashy, and incomprehensible.Not too surprisingly, those three qualities are closely intertwined. Every level features people shouting at you through your headset for reasons that are never made clear; presumably what theyre saying is related to the mission youre on, but since the voices are in untranslated, unsubtitled Japanese, thats entirely guesswork. Every level is a riot of exploding colours, but not in a good way; rather, its because the game crams lots and lots of robots and explosions and lasers into each mission, but everything happens in such a haphazard manner its not always clear whats going on. Like I said: loud, flashy, and incomprehensible.Assaults on the senses might be forgivable if Mobile Suit Gundam at least managed to be fun despite those flaws. Sadly, its not. In theory, the levels vary between escort missions, squad-based battles, and capture-the-flag-style fights. In practice, however, while the objectives may differ, the gameplay is all the same  lots of shooting missiles and clashing robot swords, repeated over and over again until you reach the missions end.On top of that, the combat isnt even particularly fun. None of the robots move in anything close to a fluid manner, which means youre left with clunky giants moving around awkwardly. True to life, perhaps (if there were such a thing as giant fighting robots), but not all that enjoyable.", "date": "September 8, 2016", "grade": "D+"}
