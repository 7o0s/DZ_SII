{"name": "FIFA 18", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2017/09/fifa-18-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "Last year, FIFA 17 made a strong bid for the NBA 2K franchises perennial hold on the title of Best Sports Game. This year, I think its safe to say that FIFA 18 has knocked NBA 2K off its perch entirely.Admittedly, this is partly because NBA 2K18 is less a basketball game, and more a pay-to-win microtransaction machine that happens to have a basketball theme. But even if it wasnt  even if NBA 2K18 didnt force you to grind your way through endless practices and workouts and try to extract real money out of you for a new haircut  Im confident that Id still say that FIFA 18 had surpassed its competition.Much like last years outing, FIFA 18s strength comes from a fantastic career/story mode. Picking up where FIFA 17 left off, FIFA 18 finds you guiding Alex Hunter through life as a footballer (to use his terminology), with the key difference that where last year he was an unknown teenager, this year hes adapting to life as a budding star. The game, too, has adapted to Hunters newfound fame, with a story that spans multiple continents, and that shows him making the jump from club teams to mingling with the rich and famous. Players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Rio Ferdinand, and NBAer James Harden make appearances, and even if theyre not exactly voice acting pros, their presence certainly adds to the feeling the game is trying to convey.Whats more, the game doesnt forget to make Hunter seem like a human being. You still have the family drama that was such a crucial part of what made the first games story interesting, and likewise, you still have the branching dialogue trees that impact how the game evolves. Whats new this time around is that the game allows you to change Hunters look  occasionally it even rewards you for doing so  and in the process, makes Hunter feel less like a blank slate on a screen, and more like a living, breathing character.And, of course, the action on the field is exactly what weve come to expect from FIFA by now. Regardless of the mode youre playing, the game delivers a pretty solid approximation of what you could watch on TV. In fact, when youre playing in career mode, the game gently chides you every so often if youre playing at an easier level than you should/could be. Case in point: after a game where I/Hunter scored at least a half-dozen goals, a reporter asked him after the game if it ever felt like he was playing soccer on too easy a difficulty level (Im paraphrasing, but only slightly). FIFA 18 is committed to delivering an authentic  and appropriately flashy  experience.I should admit, of course, that I hardly even bothered with the game outside of the career mode. If youre wondering how this years Ultimate Team works, for example, I wouldnt be able to tell you.", "date": "September 28, 2017", "grade": "A+"}
