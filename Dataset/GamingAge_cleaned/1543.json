Youre looking at Switch Galaxy Ultras screenshots, and youre seeing those sleek ships and that space-age setting, and its inevitable. Youre thinking that this game borrows heavily from Wipeout. Maybe F-Zero if youre in a retro kind of mood. Either way, you probably think you know exactly what this game has in store for you.Youd be wrong, though. While Switch Galaxy Ultra may borrow heavily from the Wipeout/F-Zero school of design  to the point the cutscene comics were done by original Wipeout concept artist Darren Douglas  its actual gameplay isnt all that similar. In fact, if you really want an analogue, you need to look to a different game: Battletoads.Or, to be more precise, the turbo tunnels. You know the ones. The levels that every NES gamer simultaneously feared and loved. The one that made a generation of kids fling controllers in frustration. The one part of the game that people still remember vividly, decades after the fact. Those levels.Of course, the comparison isnt perfect, and its doubtful Switch Galaxy Ultra will be the same source of nostalgia for 30-somethings in the mid-2030s that Battletoads is today. For starters, because it borrows so heavily from other games, it doesnt have that same revelatory feeling that its antecedents had. Nor is it as difficult  sure, it gets harder the further in you get, but at no time did I want to hurl my Vita across the room. (Not that thats necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but I doubt Battletoads turbo tunnels would evoke the same emotions decades after the fact if theyd been easy to beat.)Most importantly, though, the gameplay just isnt there. The whole game is a little too one-note. Obviously, not every game needs to have varied gameplay, but here, youre essentially doing the same thing in the 55th level that youre doing in the first. This, in turn, speaks to that difficulty issue, and that even if the game occasionally adds in new obstacles, it still starts feeling like youre just doing the same thing over and over again after awhile.Even worse, the controls arent as precise enough as they need to be for the game to pull off what it wants to do. During the regular portions of the track, this isnt too bad a thing; youll occasionally switch lanes into an obstacle too early or you wont switch onto an acceleration pad quick enough, but those things are minor annoyances. Whats less cool is the lack of precision during the special sections, when youre going at warp speed collecting Tantalum. Here, its much harder to judge exactly where you are in relation to the glowing orbs, which means that collecting all of them is a bit of a pain. Considering that you only advance in the game as long as you have a certain number of Tantalum, that quickly becomes an issue as you have to go back and keep trying (and retrying) earlier levels in order to move on.Despite these issues, however, I still really enjoyed Switch Galaxy Ultra. Maybe it just hit my nostalgic sweet spot, but there was something fun about zipping back and forth between lanes, dodging all the obstacles in my path. Even if you never reach the speed of the turbo tunnel, you still zip along at a nice pace, and the game conveys that really well. Likewise, the designs may not be all that original, but that doesnt mean they dont look fantastic.", "date": "January 5, 2015", "grade": "B+"}
