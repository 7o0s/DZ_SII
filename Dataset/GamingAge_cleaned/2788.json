Everything about it, from its relatively minimalist graphics to its simple-ish gameplay feels like it would be much better suited to playing on a phone than on a Switch or a PC.Well, almost everything. Theres the little matter that Unlock the King 3 would be a pretty lousy mobile game, for the same reasons that its a pretty lousy Switch game.For one thing, the gameplay isnt at all intuitive. Theres little in the way of explanation, and even after you figure out what youre supposed to be doing  clearing a path for the king to the other end of the chess board  its never totally clear how that works sometimes. I frequently solved levels just by moving other pieces around randomly, which doesnt seem like it should be happening in a well-made puzzle game.This, in turn, is an issue because Unlock the King 3 is trying to be chess, but its also trying to be a Rubiks Cube, and the two things dont seem to be all that compatible. You want to play around with the different sides of a Rubiks Cube until you find the right combination, whereas this games chess board restricts what you can do, and in this case that means that you often work the board/cube into a position where it absolutely cant move and you have to search around the screen until you find the button that allows you to restart the level.Which points to the games other issue: the touch controls are awful. Its hard to manipulate the camera. Its hard to move the board/cube around. Its hard to move the game pieces. Basically, whatever Unlock the King 3 wants you to do, it constantly gets in your way of doing it.And that, more than anything else, is why its impossible to recommend it. Even if Unlock the King 3 were the simplest, most straightforward game imaginable, it would still be a constant chore to play it. Couple lousy controls with gameplay thats not all that interesting or intuitive, and you can see why  whatever the platform  its probably not worth playing", "date": "December 11, 2020", "grade": "C-"}
