A witch? A she-devil? Something like that?In all honesty, I have no idea. Im pretty sure its in that ballpark. I mean, youre dressed all provocatively, you talk towitches or demons or something, and you lure your enemies  who Im 99% sure are the good guys  to their deaths. Oh, youre possibly after something called the Holy Verses. Or you need to stop other people from getting them. Again, not totally sure.As you can tell, I wasnt paying very close attention to everything that happened during cutscenes. In my defense, however, this is because I was speeding through those to get to the good part of Deception IV  otherwise known as killing all those aforementioned good guys in the most delightfully gruesome and inventive ways I could come up with.In this respect, Im kind of tempted to compare Deception IV to Earth Defense Force. After all, in both games (at least for me), whatever story or plot there may be takes a back seat to the joys of sending people to their bloody dooms and blowin stuff up real good, respectively. Though that comparison isnt entirely perfect, since plot is much easier to ignore when it comes to EDF, on account of the fact its so basic; in Deception IV, there was clearly some effort put into creating some kind of narrative, and I just chose to ignore it.I dont feel that bad about doing so, however. Like I said, its really hard to care too much about this like plot development and characterization when you just want to launch your enemy into a furnace shaped like a cow. Or, better yet, when you just want to drop a pumpkin on their head, catch them in a bear trap as theyre lurching around, hit them with a giant swinging blade while theyre stuck, have them step on a rake, and then watch as they stumble forward and land in a heap. Right in the path of an oncoming train, naturally.Now, if that description didnt get you all tingly insidecongratulations on not being a psychopath, I guess. But more to the point, a) whats wrong with you? Cow furnaces and whirring blades of death and whatnot!, and b) then this game probably isnt for you. Because, attempts at story aside, thats really all you do in Deception IV: plot out elaborate Rube Goldberg machines of death, and then hope that your enemies step on just the right space so the mayhem can begin. And when they dontyou run around avoiding being hit until your traps have a chance to reset, and the cycle begins anew.", "date": "April 11, 2014", "grade": "B+"}
