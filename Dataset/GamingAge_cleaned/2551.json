{"name": "Faircrofts Antiques: The Heir of Glen Kinnoch", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2021/09/faircrofts-antiques-the-heir-of-glen-kinnoch-review-for-nintendo-switch-pc/", "text": "As Ive written before, I have a weird love for hidden object games. I dont know what it is, but even when theyre terrible, I still cant get enough of hunting around for nonsensical objects.On the scale of great to terrible, Faircrofts Antiques: The Heir of Glen Kinnoch definitely falls at the upper end. To be sure, when were talking about hidden object games, were not exactly talking about a massive distance between the two extremes, but still: as the genre goes, its clear that this is a (relative) standout.In part, this is because the game shows that there can be more to the genre than find all these random items. The Heir of Glen Kinnoch has that, sure, but it also occasionally changes course and asks you to find lots of the same object (say, a dozen chipmunks), while elsewhere it gives you riddles about each item youre seeking. I know that doesnt seem like much, but within the genre, that kind of counts for innovation.It also helps that there are some puzzles here, and that theyre not awful. Again, thats a very low bar, and The Heir of Glen Kinnochs puzzles are mostly very simple jigsaw puzzles (coupled with a few that simply ask you to match cards), but given how abysmal the puzzles tend to be in other hidden object games, Ill take simple and functional every time.Lastly, Ill add that The Heir of Glen Kinnoch looks very nice. Again, were only talking about static screens, but given how ugly some hidden object games can be, its nice to find one that actually puts some effort into how it looks.To be sure, none of this makes Faircrofts Antiques: The Heir of Glen Kinnoch an essential buy, nor does it mean you need to load up on the other games in the series, Faircrofts Antiques: Treasures of Treffenburg and Faircrofts Antiques: Home for Christmas  though both of them have the same mixture of nice visuals and interesting (by the genres standards) puzzles. But if, like me, you have a soft spot for a pretty innocuous genre, then this game should be right up your alley.", "date": "September 13, 2021", "grade": "B"}
