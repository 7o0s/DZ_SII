{"name": "Batman  The Telltale Series: Episode Three New World Order", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/11/batman-telltale-series-episode-three-new-world-order-review-ps4-xbox-one/", "text": "You have to wonder how much crazier and darker Batman: The Telltale Series could possibly get. With this episode and the rest going forward, I will be stepping into Spoiler territory, so youve been warned. Remember, some of my decisions will reflect a different outcome that you may experience. After everything that has transpired to this point, its a sign of relieve that episode 3 take a more narrative approach.This episode is focused on building deeper into the relationships between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle/Harvey Dent. Depending on who you chose to help at the end of episode 2 will either postpone or excel the creation of Harvey as Two Face. As a vast majority of players, I chose to save Catwoman which caused Harvey to be struck with a stage light by Penguin.Its one of those decisions that I look forward to going back and see the end result by choosing Harvey. So, when episode 3 starts, Bruce goes to visit Harvey in the hospital. With my story arc, hes in the hospital bed with his face bandaged up. From here, you begin to see how much the accident affected him. Telltale has done a remarkable job with choosing the voice talent behind each character.As you make your way through the episode, you get bombarded with a flood of conflicts. Between the your current status quo with Dent, to trying to figure out if you can trust Selina, episode three may take a back seat in the action department, but it will leave you emotionally exhausted. Sometimes, it feels like no matter what you choose to say and/or do, the shit will still hit the fan. Then again, this is the Telltale formula to perfection.Its a lot to take in for Bruce and even for Batman because playing both sides so closely creates some inner conflict. Dent has had Bruces side for the majority of the game thus far until right before he was injured. He showed a side of desperation that for me was a turn off and was the cause for me choosing not to save him. Dents split personality takes a front row seat in a way that Ive never seen. He has a constant battle with himself/Two Face as he tries to reconcile with Bruce. This is one of the most enjoyable moments for me this episode.Aside from being a dialog focused episode, you get to be Batman the detective once again to solve another crime scene involving the chemicals that you found in the first episode. Once you discover more details about this compound, its finally time to confront the Children of Arkham. Then the focus switches to combat and you will face off with the mysterious COA leader that appeared on the TVs during Penguins takeover last episode. This battle leaves the caped crusader in bad shape.Toward the end of the episode, you see the split personality of Harvey Dent/ Two Face even more. It was a treat seeing his origin changed in a small but effective way. A fan of the Batman mythos, I would usually be concerned that writers change things up for the worse and in contrast, compare the stories to what I know. Not once has this happened for me with Batman: The Telltale Series. You end up in a conflict between Harvey and Selina after he comes to visit her, only to find good ol Bruce in his underoos.As for the mysterious COG leader, little is known. At first glance had me thinking, it could be Telltales take on The Scarecrow, with the chemicals and all. How wrong I was. The eventual reveal was shocking and will leave it for the readers to play and discover on their own. I cant wait to play more.", "date": "November 1, 2016", "grade": "B"}
