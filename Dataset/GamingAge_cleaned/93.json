Ive long been bothered by the way that freemium and 99 cent mobile games have skewed perspectives on fair pricing, so I dont want to contribute to that. And yet, the more I play Tap Skaters, the more I cant help but feel that its a little overpriced.Like, its currently free on the App store. Notwithstanding the Switch version of the game doesnt indulge in as many opportunities to gouge you at every opportunity, even then its only $3 to remove ads and give you unlimited continues  which, near as I can tell, is what you get on the Switch.And were not talking about a game thats substantially improved with physical controls. As the title implies, Tap Skaters is built around tapping the screen. You control a skater whos continuously rolling downhill, and you have to tap the screen to have him move down a level. You can also tap a button, but its not like theres a big difference between tapping the screen or tapping a button.This is the case even though Tap Skaters does require some level of precision. Complicating matters is that most levels have obstacles of some sort, and that hitting them is instant death. Further, the levels here dont have checkpoints, so you have to achieve your objectives  grab X coins, win a race, etc.  in one shot, or else its back to the beginning.As you can imagine, it makes for a frustrating experience, not least because its kind of hard to make snap judgments on one level to avoid obstacles, while at the same time looking ahead a few levels to consider obstacle placement down there, too. When you get it right, its pretty rewarding, since it feels like youve accomplished something, but a sense of accomplishment when you beat a level should be the bare minimum feeling a game aspires to inspiring, not an accomplishment in and of itself.Plus,of course, Tap Skaters never feels like much more than a mobile game that youre paying a premium to play on the Switch. To be sure, theres nothing inherently wrong with mobile games  and theres not even anything wrong with mobile games moving over to the Switch  but when theyre as basic as this, it makes it hard to see why you should bother, when its just as easy to play the original at a fraction of the price.", "date": "August 21, 2019", "grade": "C+"}
