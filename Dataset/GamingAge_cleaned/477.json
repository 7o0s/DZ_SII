{"name": "Tesla vs Lovecraft", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/07/tesla-vs-lovecraft-review-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch-pc/", "text": "It should come as no surprise that Tesla vs Lovecraft is a top-down twin-stick shooter. After all, its made by 10tons, who, off the top of my head, have also made Time Recoil, Neon Chrome, Crimsonland, and Jydge. Theyve made other stuff, too  much of which Ive rather enjoyed  but they certainly seem to have found their niche within that particular genre.Within 10tons oeuvre, Tesla vs Lovecraft slots in right around the middle. Its nowhere near as good as the exceptional Time Recoil, but its also miles better than the awful Crimsonland. In fact, if pressed Id probably place it squarely between Neon Chrome and Jydge, which captures perfectly how middle-of-the-road this game is.To be clear, that doesnt mean its bad. It does everything youd expect from a twin-stick shooter, and it does with a little bit of style. Playing as the eponymous inventor, youre battling monsters that are literally Lovecraftian nightmares, conjured from the depths of hell by the famed/infamous horror writer himself. You have weapons that range from revolvers to nukes, and you battle your way through appropriately spooky Victorian settings.With a set-up like that, you might think that imagination was one of Tesla vs. Lovecrafts strong suits. Unfortunately, youd be wrong. While the game undeniably has a unique premise, it doesnt seem to do much more with it  its just a standard twin-stick shooter with a horror/sci-fi twist.Again, theres nothing inherently wrong with that. 10tons have shown time and again that they know how to make sci-fi-inflected twin-stick shooters, and Tesla vs Lovecraft doesnt suggest theyre losing their touch. But it also doesnt do anything particularly noteworthy, either, which makes it hard to be too enthusiastic about the game.", "date": "July 6, 2018", "grade": "B-"}
