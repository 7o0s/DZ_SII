Between Word Puzzles, Word Search, Pix-A-Pix, and Fill-A-Pix, I sank hours  if not days  into Lightwood Games 2018 output, and in several cases I played everything those games had to offer across multiple systems.Thanks to thisobsession, Ive learned there are two categories of Lightwood Games, er, games. There are those I played to death because I genuinely loved them (see Pic-A-Pix and Word Puzzles), and those I became addicted to in part because I wanted the associated Platinum trophy for beating everything (Fill-A-Pix, Im looking in your direction). While the sheer number of puzzles on offer here meant that, towards the end of my time with the game, part of me was almost dreading hearing the same music over and over again, Im fairly certain Id include this game in the former category rather than the latter.After all, Word Sudoku hits one of my puzzling sweet spots. Im a fan of sudoku, and a fan of word games; combine the two, and I dont think I could look away even if I wanted to. And, of course, I dont want to, since the idea of building puzzles around nine-letter words is something Im 100% into.What makes the game truly addictive is that it gets more difficult the further into it you get. While the easy puzzles are the kinds of things you can breeze through in a couple of minutes, by the time you reach the hardest ones youll look up at the end of a puzzle and discover that half an hour has passed you by.Admittedly, this means that if youre anything like me, Word Sudoku is a dangerous time sink. But, at the same time, it also means that itll provide you with hours and hours of fun  which is really the point of these kinds of games, isnt it?", "date": "January 7, 2019", "grade": "B"}
