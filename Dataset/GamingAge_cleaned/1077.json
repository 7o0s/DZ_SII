I mean, its a 2D fighting game. Im undoubtedly showing my ignorance here, but I feel like theres not a tonne of variety when it comes to that genre. There are obviously nuances that separate Street Fighter from Marvel vs. Capcom, or Blazblue from Guilty Gear, but in general terms, if youve played one, youll have a pretty good idea of whats in store for you here.To be sure, its not exactly the same as those games. The attacks in Skullgirls are built around the characters, which  as Ill explain shortly  gives them some individuality. Beyond those, though, its all your standard punch-kick-combo move-teammate assist controls, all of which will seem pretty familiar to anyone whos ever put in any amount of time with these games.However, while Skullgirls 2nd Encores gameplay may be a little lacking in originality, it more than makes up for that by having an aesthetic thats 100% its own.See, Skullgirls oozes style. A very specific style, in fact: art deco-meets-film noir. Obviously, Autumn Games didnt come up with that combination, but its still clear that they had a distinctive vision of how they wanted this game to look and feel  and, whats more, its clear that they put a lot of care and attention into turning that vision into a reality.This means that the slang-heavy dialogue sounds like it comes from some fast-talking movie from the early days of talkies. This means that the music sounds like it should be spilling out the window of a smoke-filled speakeasy. And, most of all, it means that the characters and the environments and pretty much every graphic element of the game look like they sprang forth fully-formed from the minds of, say, Tamara de Lempicka or Ert. Its pretty impressive stuff, with the only downside being that everything looks oddly muted on the Vitas smaller screen. I dont know what they had to sacrifice in order to make the game run properly, but you always have the sense that youre looking at a somewhat pale reflection of incredible art, rather than at the incredible art itself.", "date": "July 15, 2016", "grade": "B"}
