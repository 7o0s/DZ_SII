{"name": "Redout 2", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2022/07/redout-2-review-for-ps5-4-xbox-series-x-one-switch/", "text": "My biggest complaints about the first Redout were a) that it didnt have a distinctive enough personality to set itself apart from its biggest influences (specifically, Wipeout and F-Zero), and b) even though the game said you were moving at high speeds, it still felt sluggish. The good news about Redout 2: to varying degrees, both of those problems have been fixed.This doesnt mean, however, that Redout 2 is free from flaws. Rather, it just means that its replaced the problems of its first game with a whole new set of problems this time around.To be fair, the new problems can all be boiled down to this: Redout 2 is hard. It requires a lot more dexterity than your typical racing game. Its not just one button to move, one to steer, and one to brake. Rather, youve also got to manage the horizontal and vertical directions your ship is facing at all times, while also using your turbo boost as much as you can. As someone whos never been insanely dextrous with a controller, Im not going to lie: its a huge challenge to press both sets of shoulder buttons and both thumbsticks all at once, and I was horrible at it.It doesnt help that youre expected to do all of that while also flying down a very winding track so quickly you can barely see whats going on around you. Every track is non-stop colours and flashing lights, and if youre not taking a crazy hairpin turn left or right, youre probably steering up or down as the track changes its orientation. Or, sometimes, youre being called on to manage both your pitch and your yaw as you go hurtling off a jump thats also a 90 degree turn, and thats far enough away you need to hammer on your booster button. Replicate that for a few minutes at a time across 36 tracks that are all very different from each other, and youll see why this game is such a challenge to master.It also doesnt help you cant change the difficulty until youve beaten the lengthy tutorial  or, in other words, you cant make Redout 2 any easier until youve basically mastered it. Its rare to see a racing game that so thoroughly embraces the get good approach to difficulty levels, but thats pretty much what Redout 2 does.Having said all that, if youre after a challenge, I can see why Redout 2 might be so appealing. Each of the tracks was clearly laboured over extensively, and the game takes the time to give you a very detailed lore behind each track. While cosmetically the game still has a lot in common with the likes of Wipeout and F-Zero, its clear that the developers wanted it to be a lot more than that. They wanted a game with its own personality, and thats what theyve created.On top of that, there are game modes galore here  you dont just have time attacks and races, you also have boss races and arena races (which have zero margin for error, since its one crash and youre out) and last man standing modes. This is a game where youll have plenty of opportunities to master each track in multiple ways.Of course, Redout 2 is specifically designed for people who need to master every track  anyone who stops short of that probably wont enjoy it too much. Its meant for people who want racers to challenge them, so if thats what youre after, this is a game you need to play.", "date": "July 8, 2022", "grade": "C"}
