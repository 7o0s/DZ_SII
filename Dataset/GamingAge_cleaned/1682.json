{"name": "Magical Beat", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2014/07/magical-beat-review-for-ps-vita/", "text": "Normally a puzzle game wont grab my attention unless its based on some musical hook. Magical Beat falls happily under this umbrella, as a match-three vertical puzzle game, with the twist being that dropping blocks is tied to the beat itself. This formula sounds like it could be hit-or-miss, as most puzzle games are reliant on the pace a player chooses, along with the dreaded necessary evil of what the soundtrack will be like. Threes really nothing worse than a music game with bad music.Luckily for Magical Beat, it hits its mark on these essentials, with some great little tunes to capitalize on a risky set of mechanics. The match-three element, being a relatively simple puzzle genre, holds a lot water when paired with the fact that youll be dropping blocks to the tempo of a song. A meter sitting in the center of the screen will indicate ideal timing for dropping blocks, with BPM changing between levels. This works great, although some may find the rhythmically-dictated gameplay to be intrusive, so feel free to pass on this if youre the impatient type, or, alternatively, not great with music games.While the game keeps things fresh with a different tempo per song, the gameplay will otherwise remain unchanged. Magical Beat may not be a retail-priced game, but its a wasteland for variety in gameplay. The inclusion of some typical extra modes would have helped maintain the appeal of a game with no more than single-player in three difficulty levels, local multiplayer, and a playlist mode. Im not really sure what the staying power is in Magical beat, past re-playing single-player and waiting until you run into someone else with a Vita and a copy of the game on them.Then again, maybe you just want to play a puzzle game that syncs to BlazBlue and Guilty Gear songs.The mechanics are, as mentioned, otherwise solid, although they may not be very deep. Missing a beat penalizes players with a separation of their brick into randomized placement of its three little blocks, which maintains momentum without punishing a lack of precision too fiercely. In regards to something more substantial, a mode based around playing the full duration of a song would have balanced the nature of tracks being capable of completion before the song is halfway through.", "date": "July 28, 2014", "grade": "C+"}
