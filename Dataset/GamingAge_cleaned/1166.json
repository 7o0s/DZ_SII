{"name": "Ninja Senki DX", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2016/03/ninja-senki-dx-review-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "For the life of me, I cant figure out why Ninja Senki DX exists.I mean, I get that Tribute Games apparently decided to mark the fifth anniversary of one of their old games by polishing it up and re-releasing it on the Vita, PS4 and PC. And I dont want to give the impression that its a bad game, by any stretch: its perfectly adequate in every respect.Its just that Ninja Senki DX is a retro-inspired platformer that doesnt seem to have anything new to say. Like, if someone were to tell me that the game really was from 25+ years ago, and that some enterprising developer had just grabbed the old source code and dumped it onto the PSN, Id have no trouble believing that. It borrows liberally from Mega Man andwell, thats pretty much all it does. Theres no unique twist; there are no interesting new mechanics. Its just a really, really hard platformer that wouldve been right at home on the NES.Theres nothing inherently wrong with that, of course. Im not going to look at those old games through nostalgia lenses and pretend that they were perfect the first time around. I lived through them then, so I know thats not the case. And to Ninja Senki DXs credit, its a pretty pitch-perfect imitator in every respect, from the simple controls, to the basic graphics and chiptunes music, to the insane level of difficulty.", "date": "March 21, 2016", "grade": "B"}
