{"name": "Eight-Minute Empire: Complete Edition", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2019/11/eight-minute-empire-complete-edition-review-for-nintendo-switch/", "text": "Even though Ive always wanted to enjoy games like Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Carcassonne, Ive never been fully able to on account of the fact Im horrifically bad at them. I like the idea of conquering territories and building up cities, but as soon as you need to start planning ahead with your moves and strategizing, I fall to pieces.As such, I was kind of excited to play Eight-Minute Empire. Its based on a board game of the same name that, as you can guess, is built around quick play sessions. You still have to conquer a map and gather resources, but your time is limited. Rather than agonizing for hours over troop movements and resource gathering, you get 13 moves to do everything you want to do  in other words, individual games are over and done with long before theres any chance of getting distracted or losing track of whats going on.Sounds right up my alley then, right? Wellkind of. On the one hand, it was fun to actually win a game like this (even if it was against AI set to easy). Its simple enough that even someone like me can grasp the rules fairly quickly: you get as many troops as you can, you gain as much land as you can, and its all over before you have time to get bogged down in individual decisions. Admittedly, I didnt play with others, but based on my own experience, its safe to assume that almost literally anyone can pick it up and figure it out quickly, which is exactly what youd want out of a party game.That said, the flip side of that is also true. Even for someone whose abilities are as limited as mine, Eight-Minute Empire started feeling pretty shallow after a very short while. It didnt take long for it to become apparent that once you get beyond the initial bidding of who goes first (which isnt something you want to win, since this game definitely rewards whoever goes last), most of the game is based on luck of the draw. You get 13 rounds of card-drawing, and even if you have to manage your cash a little early on to make sure you have slightly better options at the end of the game, its pretty apparent that you should draw whatever card gives you the most troops or the most troop movements.But, I suppose, thats kind of the point of a game like this. If you wanted tough strategy, you wouldnt be playing a game that can be easily completed in, as its name suggests, less than ten minutes. Eight-Minute Empire most definitely wont challenge you too much, but as board games on the Switch go, its definitely among the most easily-accessible.", "date": "November 19, 2019", "grade": "B-"}
