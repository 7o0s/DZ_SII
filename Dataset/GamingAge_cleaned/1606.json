While it wasnt one of my favorite games ever or anything, back in the nascent days of touch gaming, it was one of the best games available on iDevices (which, obviously, wasnt as big an achievement then as it would be now), and showed that games on Apples little technological wonder could be a little more complex than, say, Doodle Jump. Consequently, I was curious to see whether the games status as a great mobile game would carry over to platforms with buttons and thumbsticks.Short answer: nope, not really. Not for the reasons you might think, though. You might expect that the games short levels and basic controls dont translate well to longer sittings, but as the Trials series has already shown, such concerns are unfounded. Theres not a massive difference between pressing buttons and nudging joysticks, and pressing the screen and tilting your device, so in that respect, the transition is pretty smooth.Unfortunately, the same cant be said for the rest of the move over. To be blunt, the game feels unfinished. While the core game may be there, thats pretty much it. Theres no music or extra sounds, for starters; while that may not sound like a big thing on paper, when youre actually playing it, the absence of ambient noise is surprisingly noticeable. To only hear the roar of the engine, with no radio blaring or audience cheering in the background, just feels kind of weird. I know that, technically, the tracks youre racing on are suspended in the middle of the sky, but I doubt that Grip Games wanted players to feel like theyre racing in a giant, empty void.Of even greater concern is the fact that the camera is so lousy, it makes it seem like the game is irredeemably glitchy. Though, alternatively, its quite possible that Jet Car Stunts actually is insanely glitchy. Either way, it does the game no favors that when you land upside down  as youll probably do quite a bit, since Jet Car Stunts is nothing if not incredibly hard  the camera doesnt know how to handle it. I cant count the number of times it looked as though I was just floating in mid-air, left to spin my wheels uselessly, because the game hadnt registered that Id flipped over, missed a jump or somehow landed on the underside of the track. It only takes a button press to reset to the last checkpoint, but you have to think that a slightly more completed game wouldnt have issues like that.", "date": "October 21, 2014", "grade": "B"}
