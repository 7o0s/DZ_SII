{"name": "The Bards Tale: Remastered and Resnarkled", "ref": "https://gaming-age.com/2018/01/the-bards-tale-remastered-and-resnarkled-review-for-ps-vita-ps4/", "text": "Given that The Bards Tale originally came out on PS2 and the original Xbox back in 2004, it shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone that the game is showing its age a decade and a half later. Even in its newer remastered form, pretty much everything about the game looks, sounds, and plays incredibly dated.As you can imagine, this makes certain aspects of the game difficult to enjoy. In particular, the graphics are ugly. Like, were talking hideous eyesores. To be sure, being crammed onto the Vitas smaller screen probably doesnt help matters much, but its bad enough that, somehow, I cant imagine seeing things in greater detail would help. Other aspects of the game have aged slightly better, albeit not by much. The games sense of humour and overall snarky tone comes off as very being much of a specific time  that is, the late-90s/early 2000s. The Bards Tale is still undeniably a funny game, but where it may have seemed like the most hilarious thing ever back when it first came out, now it sometimes feels like its trying a little too hard. That said, the game is helped immeasurably by having strong voice acting: Cary Elwes and Tony Jay are (or were, in the late Jays case) legendary for a reason, and their talents are able to make even the stalest material sound pretty good, even today, years after they were recorded.You could make a decent argument for the games combat/gameplay, too. On the one hand, The Bards Tales top-down action also feels like the kind of thing that was more in vogue back when it came out. On the plus side, however, the game takes a relatively streamlined approach to everything that feels much more modern; I dont know that the games 20+ hour running time could be called short, exactly, but it does feel like the game is more willing to get to the point than many of its contemporaries.", "date": "January 22, 2018", "grade": "B"}
