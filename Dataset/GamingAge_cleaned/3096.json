Take The Sinking City, for example. When I first played it on PS4, I was mostly indifferent to it. I liked that it reminded me of Frogwares Sherlock series, but generally there wasnt anything that stood out  positive or negative  in my mind.Here we are half a year later, and Iwell, I wouldnt say I love it, but I feel an odd amount of fondness for it. Every time I come across another part that reminds me of my first play-through, my brain goes, Oh yeah, this part. I wouldnt think Id have much nostalgia for a game I played half a year ago  and particularly one I didnt have very strong feelings for at the time  and yet, for whatever reason, I kind of do.If anything, in fact, this version of The Sinking City is slightly worse. The load times are much more noticeable here, for one thing. There arent as many of them as you might expect for an open-world game  which is a pretty impressive feat, when you think about it  but when they do pop up, they take their time.On top of that, the eponymous city feels even emptier than before. There seems to be even fewer people living in the town of Oakmont in this Switch version than there were in the PS4 version, and those that are here are even more indifferent to your presence than in other versions. (Theres no piped-in complaints when you run into someone, for example.) Given that one of my major complaints about the PS4 version was how uninhabited and sterile the city felt, that should be a big strike against The Sinking City on the Switch.Despite all those complaints, however, I feel nothing but affection for this game. Im willing to excuse a lot more  in large part, I suspect, because I enjoy handheld games a lot more. To me, its still a novelty to get an open-world game in the palm of your hand, which is what you get here. And even with the flaws mentioned above, the game isnt a huge step down from what you get elsewhere: it plays pretty much the same, which means if you like Frogwares brand of mystery-action (see also: all their Sherlock games), you now have the added advantage of being able to take it on the go.", "date": "January 17, 2020", "grade": "B"}
