{"name": "SPOGS Racing", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=31177", "text": "Is it 1995? Ohits not? So why is there a video game that was just released based on pogs? See, I could have sworn that pogs were a 90s fad that died in the same Rubbermaid coffin under my bed as my Yo-yo collection. Apparently, developer Pronto Games feels like 2008 is the right time to capitalize on the cardboard disc craze that is just oh so hip with the kids.SPOGS Racing is a racing game about pogs. Go ahead and take a second to let that sink in. Ready to go on? Alright, good. The pogs are just floating in the middle of a tire. There are no racecars or karts, just tires. Tires with pogs floating in them, complete with a muffler sticking out of the tire. Moving past the whole physically impossible thing, we are presented with a high speed racing game. To race, you literally just hold down the 2 button and turn every so often.There really arent any real driving mechanics here. The games tracks include stunning environments such as a dirt road with the same exact palm tree to your left or right every 4 seconds.But lets not forget the stunning NASCAR style track, which is complete with little pog people in the audience and odd lines in the road that are either glitches or a sad attempt at detail.Its a pretty good diversion that makes the game feel meatier, but the bulk of the game is in the 1 Player Hard and Easy modes.The graphics of SPOGS Racing are simply insulting. This looks like a game that would have been released in 1996. Hell, maybe it should have! At least then it would have been relevant. The music is god awful midi-sounding tunes that are sure to make you leave the game feeling like youve just been punched in the head a few times. The sound effects are just as awful. If youve ever mistakenly stepped on a cat, the sound the poor feline makes is very reminiscent of the engine sound that never stops blaring in SPOGS Racing.Closing Comments:", "date": "July 7, 2008", "grade": 1.0}
