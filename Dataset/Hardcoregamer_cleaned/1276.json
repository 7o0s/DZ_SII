{"name": "Tennis in the Face", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=180231", "text": "An evil corporation, a fallen hero, revenge; Tennis in the Face is the story of a disgraced figure who is trying to save his city in a quest for redemption. His life and career ruined by the devils of Xplodz, tennis star Pete Pagassi (a play on a combination of Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras) is out to use his tennis skills to save his city. Touted as an action/puzzle game with great physics, Tennis in the Face makes a try at the Angry Birds kind of time waster. These types of games might not be the most prestigious part of gaming, but they can serve up (heh, tennis pun) some addictive fun from time to time. Unfortunately, Tennis in the Face seems to fail at a lot of basic concepts that can make these kinds of game so addictive.A suite of levels with enemies placed in set positions, the player controls a static character. With a set number of shots, the player tries to kill all of the enemies on the screen. Added points are given for less shots taken, headshots, chain reactions, etc. There are over a hundred levels in total, which seems great at first. Disappointingly, upon playing through a few, the lack of variety becomes glaringly obvious. Split into eight zones, each zone contains a specific enemy. That enemy is the only type of enemy within that zone. Type is a loosely used word in this case. The majority of the enemies retain similar gameplay mechanics, only differing in appearance. A few do have features such as armor or a shield. It isnt until the final stages that different enemies are on the screen at the same time; and even then only two different types are ever involved.The enemies do have some nice little quirks, with accessories that become separate objects upon their death. Mobile phones, riot shields, briefcases and even donuts are all seen flying around the screen when something explodes. Some of these objects, such as the riot shields, can actually kill other enemies if they hit them. So thats nice.The level designs in Tennis in the Face are incredibly dull. The majority of levels feel rushed and tacked together with little design in mind. At no point does it feel as if skill or knowledge of game mechanics is needed. Of the few that were obviously planned, some are interesting but most feel as though they were barely tested before being put in the game. For example, on multiple occasions a level would be set up in a way that if you hit the perfect spot, a chain reaction would occur, allowing you to pass the level in a single shot. Unfortunately, on a few of these levels, they simply dont work all the time. It might be a barrel repeatedly getting stuck a fraction from its target, or some other such occurrence; either way, it was at times frustrating to the point of being game breaking. To add to the frustration, success in these situations often came from making the exact same shot multiple times until it, seemingly randomly, worked.Explosive crates and rolling barrels make a small impact on the diversity of design as the game progresses. Unfortunately, the lack of ingenuity and creativity in their use only serve (heh) to highlight the overarching failure to achieve anything more than below average level design.As the player progresses through the game, there are a few different modes to unlock. Its a pity that these are simply the exact same game type with incredibly slight changes. One mode called Coin Madness has you shooting coins on generic stages. Another special mode dubbed The Tournament, has the player doing what seems to be the exact same thing as the rest of the game. To add insult to injury; if the player fights their way to the end, they get the chance to take on the bosses. That sounds pretty normal. It would be pretty normal to assume that these encounters would be at least slightly different from the majority of the game. They arent. The bosses are simply three different enemy types, split into five stages each. Three enemy types that are already used throughout the entirety of the game before that point. To make matters even worse; the stages are all taken from stages that have already been encountered in order to get to that point. The only differentiation between the boss fights and the rest of the game, is that the requirements for the stage now require the player to use one less ball.The music throughout this whole ordeal is distinctly terrible. The less said about it the better. It should be turned off immediately. However, the sound effects are reasonably good. So positive marks for that.Closing CommentsLooking at its screenshots, Tennis in the Face looks as though it could be a slightly entertaining time sink for when you need to fill a few minutes. Maybe a few laughs at the physics could be had. It could even be one of those games that gives you the nice little feeling of satisfaction at conquering a particularly difficult level. Unfortunately, after the initial seconds, Tennis in the Face completely fails at being enjoyable. Its physics can be erratic, levels seem untested and the quirky humor gets old fast. The sound effects go a long way towards making this game remotely tolerable, and occasionally a wry grin can be had at a pile of donuts showering the screen. Unfortunately, a few donuts and passable sound effects do not make a game, let alone a good one.", "date": "December 2, 2015", "grade": 2.0}
