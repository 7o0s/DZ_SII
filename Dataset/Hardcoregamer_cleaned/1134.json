{"name": "Soul Axiom", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=195373", "text": "At times like this, its hard not to fall back on the easiest of comparisons. Primarily because its a comparison no doubt everyone has already made (hence, one you cant shy away from), but it also runs the risk of undermining every other positive that goes into the finished product. Thus despite my sincerest efforts, theres no getting away from the unavoidable visual comparison to Tron in Wales Interactives latest outing, yet its equally unforgivable to not speak of the likes of Bioshock and even Metroid with as much the same breath, to hit home the odd juxtapose Soul Axiom sticks to in both its gameplay as much its World-building. A meshing of the surreal and the deceptive might not be the most fresh-faced of philosophies in any creative medium true, but regardless, its a deserved fit to Axioms gameplay and Wales Interactives cunning in detailing the coaxingly titled World that is Elysia.Set in a grand simulation where dreams and memories can now be archived to subsequently be experienced over and over, the player takes on the role of a newly-uploaded soul who, for whatever reason, has departed the World of the living and is now but one of countless millions of users now thriving in Elysias grand, utopian platform. If only the [virtual] afterlife were that straight-forward; it doesnt take long before it becomes apparent something is not quite right and while Axiom keeps matters vague as to whether you are in fact the target, or simply another passenger along for the ride, its this deliberate vagueness that, bizarrely, better suits Axioms focus on a reality trying its damnedest to appear real, if not act it.Even from the very early stages, Soul Axioms isolation and sheer emptiness, despite its perhaps infinitely-complexing scale, only leaves its scattered locales feeling less like perfectly-replicated environments and more like hollow snapshots; about as lively and relatable as stage props to some amateur dramatics performance. Bare and devoid of considerable thought it might initially appear, its far more inviting to investigate for this very reason  youre expecting more and are inclined to figure out why thats not the case. But Soul Axiom is not, as most adventure-based games now tend to accommodate, a purely linear experience that builds further and further to some possible grand reveal. Rather, to tie into this idea of archiving/storing siphoned memories, this is where perhaps the biggest surprise in Axioms presentation comes into play. The fact the central hub of sorts has, strange as this may sound, all the hallmarks of a nostalgia-drenched Playstation platformer  a la Crash Bandicoot or Spyro The Dragon  only elevates the games deceptive allure that extra bit higher.Like those classic PS1 titles, the player is required to jump between contrasting levels (each one more uncomfortably isolating than the last) before one can advance further. Regardless of the order the player chooses, after a certain number of levels are completed, a new floor (or tier) is unlocked. Soul Axioms selection of locales and ecosystems mix up the formula with mixed results, be it in its level design as well as how puzzles are structured. While there are an abundance of ninety-degree corridors and unapologetically square-shaped rooms throughout, theres often enough of a deterrence by way of interacting with the often simple structures, to warrant a need to press on. This takes us to the games main selling-point via the player-characters manipulation abilities and the way said challenges are presented. Most, though not all, of Axioms puzzle-solving revolves around the need to interact and even control elements in the environment. Whether it be deconstructing/reconstructing something to activate a switch, or rewinding the actions of a moving object, Soul Axiom  much like The Talos Principle or indeed, albeit to a lesser extent, The Witness  relies on player deduction while cleverly emphasising the need to look beyond the superficial and figure out what may be feasible in the context of a puzzle, without giving too much away.While it may not be the most revolutionary of circumstances (Wales Interactive arent reinventing the puzzle-designing wheel in this respect), the developers trusting player intellect and deciding against sign-posting every necessary step, goes a long way to keeping most (though not all) of Axioms scenarios feeling fresh enough to make the inevitable solution stand that all the more satisfying to conquer. One notable example late on, set in an apartment complex and requiring the use of a time machine, is so cleverly arranged the inevitable frustration over missing a step or inadvertently undoing a previous correct action reflects well on Wales Interactives conscientious skill in guiding the player without outright telling them the answer from the get-go.Earlier levels are of course a lot more simplistically-arranged and sized, but that doesnt take away from the need to study the environments closely and figure out how each aspect interplays. Again, the refusal to simply guide its player forward is a testament to the way recent indie developers understand seemingly-impossible puzzles only garner a players drive to further involve ones self in the structure and overall layout of such surroundings. However, while these proceedings usually involve merely interacting with one element to influence another point on the map, some moments can unfortunately fall ill to unnecessary padding in order to make the challenge appear more complex than it actually is. This isnt helped when some levels feel a little too large and open for their own good  further hindered by moments of questionable texture mapping and jagged polygons that are in fact environments at close-up.This niggling concern to not just stretch out a momentary passage, but to forcibly rely on this supposed concept of simulation as an excuse for less-than-pleasant (and far-from-polished) visual work, does grate in the most extreme cases  none more so in latter proceedings requiring you to revisit each of the games levels for a second time. Fortunately, these occasionally off-putting deterrences dont do enough to dilute what is a continuing intrigue into what, exactly, ties all these conflicting locales and memories together. And thats genuinely saying something given the attempt at story-telling, via the games cutscenes, can be laughable at the best of times and painstakingly cringe-worthy at the worst. Be it the way characters are modelled or dialogue is expressed, it says a lot for how well Axioms gameplay and immersive investigation stands as much coaxes its players away from the games obvious downfalls. An even more surprising statement given the jarring sound design does unfortunately make its way into the actual gameplay, be it opening a door or finding a sound effect fails to play from time to time.Yet, bizarrely, this is perhaps the biggest consolation to take, especially for those who may not be invested in or indeed compelled by the story underpinning the players progression. Because while there is some degree of focus on the events leading up to the game, the benefit here is that the story runs almost in parallel, rather than in tandem, with the gameplay. Hard not to ignore quality-wise sure, but the added and welcome presence is that Wales Interactive recognise that story isnt for everyone and while its clear graphics may not have been the most desired of components in some areas (though its hard not to praise the more neon-tainted locales as anything but lush), the essence of the gameplay  coupled with the conflict of a futuristic simulation and false realism that is its aesthetic and artstyle  makes for a game that is confusing but, more importantly, far from jarring in its sense of loneliness and alienation.Closing Comments:Simplistic and often jarring its intended design may seem, Soul Axiom is a game that requires, as much cunningly desires, the players warranted need to look beyond the surface thats initially presented. Whether that be in its puzzle design or the ample conflict of environments, Wales Interactive do just enough with the overarching themes of simulation and replication to make its superficial locales feel that extra bit suspicious. So while theres no getting away from how tainted the experience gets with its less-than-pleasant story-telling and/or questionable delivery, said moments seldom get in the way of what is a generally intriguing adventure. Whats more, the way it continually weaves the player-characters manipulation abilities together without feeling otherwise forced or bloated, keeps Soul Axiom sufficiently fresh throughout while incurring a reasonable familiarity at the same time.", "date": "February 29, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
