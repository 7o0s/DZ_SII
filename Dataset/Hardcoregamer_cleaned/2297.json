Some gamers were able to play it months and even years before it arrived on everyones favorite digital distributor. Now that its out, players can finally see what the fuss was all about  and if the the drawn out hype was worth it.First, an introduction is in order. Developer Messhof first started touring the game around (and winning contests) in 2010. Although it is not the only fencing game in existence, it is certainly part of a rare class of titles. Pairing the fairly unique concept with fast play and multiplayer just seemed like the next logical steps. Now that Nidhogg is finally out, there is not only a multiplayer mode but a single player journey against a series of increasingly-difficult opponents.Whichever mode you play, the beautifully simple gameplay shines through. Your pixelated fencer has only a foil (sword) to defend against the enemy. Thrusting, parrying, and even throwing the sword are some of the moves youll learn first. But even though it seems incredibly simple, Nidhogg slowly reveals layers of difficulty the more time one spends with it. Sometimes its due to seeing the AI (or another player) pull off an awesome trick. Other times, youll just discover something on accident while fighting wildly. Learning effective strategies and skills comes with time and a fair bit of losses.Like more typical fighting games, this can be played at a speedy pace or with slow precision. It mostly depends on the situations players get wedged in, the skill of opponents, and personal play style. Of course, with friends, its likely that everything will get hectic quite fast. Local multiplayer mode is an excellent way to play as real players always trump AI. This is especially true here because most of the single player fights give the AI specific attitudes/attacks that they rarely diverge from. Once you know what it is, theres little difficulty in exploiting the weakness.Getting friends together to experience Nidhogg has to be one of the best modern local experiences in a long time. Players can battle it out one on one in single matches, or pass controllers around in a tournament mode. No matter the case, the screams and laughter that will most certainly ensue are worth the price of admission. Those who arent able to play against others in person can get their multiplayer itch satisfied online.As of right now, however, online is imperfectly implemented. Matchmaking works well and can set you up with a mostly lag-free fencing bout thanks to the quickly growing player base. Some folks seem keen to exit losing matches but theyre not common yet. The main issue with online mode is that it can be hard to play against your own friends. There are varying reports showing users being able to invite friends, while others are simply unable to. I fall into the latter category. Sure, most of the strangers put up great fights, but its almost always more fun to play with a buddy.Nidhoggs greatest asset happens to be its biggest downfall. Playing the game can easily transform into obsessively studying it and seeking to improve your own skills, but none of this can happen if you dont find reason to continue playing. Fighting against others is that reason for me, and it would work so much better if I had a reliable link to friends. With strangers, I could care less if they see me fail. Those in the same boat as me will find their adoration of the game quickly dry up. Its a tremendous shame.Even if you feel this way, at least its still possible to admire the visual and audio design. Graphically, characters are incredibly simplistic pixel renderings plastered against weirdly colored locales. The whole game has a very dreamy vibe, and it stands out tremendously against other pixelated titles. The dynamic audio by Daedelus is similarly distinctive, and might even rival Hotline Miami in the strange, but cool soundtrack department.Closing Comments:", "date": "January 18, 2014", "grade": 3.5}
