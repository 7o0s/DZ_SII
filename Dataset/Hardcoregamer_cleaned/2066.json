{"name": "Bombing Bastards", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=92913", "text": "Bombing Bastards can best be thought of as Bomberman andwell, nothing else. Dont let the title fool you, this is Bomberman at its very core  just with a different name and robots for characters. Outside of that, developer Sanuk Games have taken it upon themselves to give audiences a proper bombing-arena puzzler since Hudson seemingly refuses to. In that, what Wii U owners ultimately have here is a solid, albeit grossly unoriginal, endeavor that is somewhat lacking as a single player excursion, but nevertheless challenging and entertaining when a few friends are brought along for the ride.Bastards is not too concerned with telling an extrapolating tale. Instead, it simply establishes some characters and a loose plot, then lets players go to town with the actual gameplay. The story that is present is basic: players assume the role of a robot created by one Dr. Wallow. The doc, in this case, is a bit of a nutjob for all intents and purposes, with the primary goal of intergalactic domination driving his ambitions. To make this dream a reality, he employs our heroic android to do his bidding, which ultimately equates to trouncing baddies with bombs. Despite having the narrative depth of a kiddy-pool, Bombing Bastards actually has some humorous dialogue to impart on its players. It never takes itself seriously, and Dr. Wallows character is such a dick that its hard not to laugh at his repeated insults and self-esteem dethroning comments. Sure, most of the exchanges written are throwaways, and serve very little in the way of building an actual narrative, but thats probably the way it should be in a game such as this  as none of us are playing it for some semblance of an awarding winning tale. Thus, the plot is just enough to keep players entertained, but never distracted or pulled from the core experience. Folks whove played a Bomberman game will feel right at home with Bastards. In actuality, the gameplay here is about as much of a mimic job as is probably allowed without receiving a lawsuit, cease and desist letter, or both. But for those who have never cut their teeth on a B-man game before, allow us to break it down. Essentially, everything revolves around blowing up enemies. Players start in a corner of a square level that is littered with obstacles and power-ups, and must eventually make their way to each of the foes that wanders the level in order to destroy them. The strategy aspect of Bastards comes into play by trying to trap enemies so as to explode them into little bitty pieces. Thus, players can do this by dropping bombs in specific locations as a way to dispatch opponents. There are special skills that can be acquired to help facilitate this process, such as increasing the blast radius of bombs, how many bombs one can drop at any given time and even the ability to toss bombs outright, all of which make things a bit easier. That being said, pretty much every single power-up that was in Bomberman is well-accounted for here. And we mean every, single, one.Nevertheless, players will have to make use of every item they can nab, too, as Bastards is a tough game  really tough. The AI is more than competent, besting us on dozens of occasions to the point of inciting rage-quits. That aside, though, the level of challenge feels pretty spot-on, as even playing the game alone was fun due to computer opponents keeping us on our toes with their uncanny cleverness and seeming capability to get out of some of the tightest situations in which we put them. It didnt help a players cause either that the AI can destroy power-ups by simply walking over top of them, and can even insta-kill folks by just running into them. This means that Bastards is a game that is just as much about how to run a good defense as it is learning how to set up offensive plays. Also adding to the challenge were the loose controls. More times than we care to count did we die simply because our character didnt respond in the way we expected, given our input command. This was especially frustrating because the game doesnt need anything added to its learning curve. The environments themselves also add to the inherent difficulty. As the single player campaign unfolds, stages become more and more hazardous. Initially theyre barebones in design, leaving the actual bad guys as the only real threats. Once players have to worry about enemies and environmental traps, the game begins to test ones mettle. In actuality, it all can get overwhelming at times, but Bastards is one of those games that expands players situational-awareness and capacity to think in ways that accounts for all possible scenarios and dangers the more its played. There are even boss battles thrown into the mix at the end of each series of levels. These were the best parts of the playing the game solo, as they introduce a new type of frantic and frenetic dynamic that cant be captured with the games typical enemies. Moreover, they too are super challenging; fortunately, they can be skipped and played at a later time  so that should help alleviate some of the pressure and need to perform.Having the option to skip over them was refreshing in the same way being able to put certain unsolvable puzzles on hold in Pushmo World was; it lends itself well to the flow of the experience. Players dont have to find themselves trapped on a boss they cant beat  instead, they can opt to come back to it at a later date. Fortunately, and really like all the victories, toppling a boss in Bastards feels like an enormous accomplishment. To that end, the game felt very old-school in its design; which is something we appreciated greatly. Speaking of being emotionally rewarded for a hard-fought conquest, Bastards awards a star rating at the end of each level. There are three attainable stars, and players performances are what decide the final grade. This was a nice system that had a very score-chasing feel to it, even if how it ranked folks felt arbitrary at times. Still, it was welcomed since there isnt any kind of online leaderboard or standings feature. That last bit felt a bit like a missed opportunity, though, as this is the type of experience that could thrive off having some kind of larger, Internet ranking system. If nothing else, it would give folks more of a reason to go back and replay levels, in order to hone their chops and sit pretty at the top of a ranking system. Speaking further to the concept of Internet integration, its disappointing that Bombing Bastards is vacant of any kind of online multiplayer. Instead, the insanely chaotic deathmatches that involve others are strictly relegated to local-play only. In the year 2014, it feels at best unacceptable, and at worst damn near criminal, to not include some type of online component in a game that really is designed around multiplayer. Thus, the lack of such a feature here is unexcusable, especially considering how well things go off in the typical same-screen outing. Barring that qualm, its still great to see a game support a local versus-mode; how it is executed here is really done flawlessly. In truth, this is the meat of Bastards experience. Much like Mario Kart, the games on-the-couch competitive play feels light-hearted but not without plenty of expletive-inducing situations that will have friends bantering and shouting at one another in moments of hysterical madness.But just as the missing online component ultimately feels lazy, so too do various other parts of Bastards. Firstly, the fact that this title borrows so heavily all  repeat, all  of its ideas shows that the team behind it didnt have the wherewithal to implement ideas of their own. This is seen in the gameplay, which truly is ripped straight from the book Hudson wrote with the Bomberman franchise, but also the presentation; the game doesnt even include an original soundtrack. In the place of that is a remixed compilation of well-known songs. While these remixes are in fact quite excellent, it merely serves to illustrate just how little creative and original effort went into creating Bombing Bastards. In the end, the game feels like a project that lacks its own identity because of decisions like this, never fully able to be thought of as anything more than a Bomberman clone. This is too bad, too, as Sanuk Games have it in them to churn out works of their own. There are moments when Bastards tries to define itself, particularly in those boss battles, but theyre so few and far between that the lingering memory here will probably always be, Oh, hey, remember that game for Wii U that was like Bomberman and never, Oh, hey, remember Bombing Bastards  and thats a fundamental problem both here and in the games industry at large. Nevertheless, at least the art style is strong, and the graphics themselves look great on a television, as well as on the GamePad when used for off-TV play.
