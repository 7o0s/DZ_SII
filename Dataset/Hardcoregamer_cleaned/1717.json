{"name": "NEKOPARA Vol. 1", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=125709", "text": "Kashou Minaduki is a young man with a dream. Throughout his life hes loved baking but had to do so in private, away from the disapproving eyes of his family. One day this becomes too much to bear and Kashou suddenly moves out to finally run a brand new bakery, La Soleil. Much to his surprise, however, the nearly empty bakery has two huge shipping boxes inside  and out pop two catgirls! NEKOPARA Vol. 1 begins with an incredibly goofy anime-style bang and continues in that humorous way. You might be surprised to find, however, that theres more to this visual novel than simple goofball antics.Whats the deal with these catgirls? In the world of NEKOPARA theres absolutely nothing strange about it. Apparently, catgirls live among humans normally and are often taken up as pets, workers, or romantic partners. Whatever relationships humans have with their catgirls are plainly accepted, although the protagonist seems to have a problem accepting this all as commonplace. Although they look so much like humans they still have many cat traits such as pawing madly at cat toys or drooling over fish and catnip. Its an incredibly odd thing to consider from the get go but it almost becomes normal by the end of Vol. 1.The misadventures between Kashou and his two sudden catgirl staff members, Chocola and Vanilla, start off as pretty average. Here is a guy who was fully prepared to strike out on his own when suddenly two of the family pets show up! As readers see them all interact its hard to not see how positive and enjoyable their presence is. In any case, the story progresses and issues grow more complicated about halfway through. Even though this is the first of a possible series of visual novels, it also ends on a high note. This is much better than the cliffhangers other titles are apt to use.Visual novels may not require stunning graphics to be enjoyable, but all the same this one has some seriously engaging art. Of course theres the flashy anime artwork for each character but theres even more at play. What cant be conveyed via screenshots A so called E-mote system animates each character in a lively fashion. In fact, it looks about as close as you can get to actually watching an anime series in a visual novel without going full out with animated sequences. Sometimes this does look weird though because this huge focus on E-mote means the girls are wiggling about as if they have to pee. Perhaps thats all supposed to be cute but it comes off as distracting.If youre not a big visual novel fan then NEKOPARA may honestly shock you with its lack of decisions. Throughout an entire playthrough of the game you wont ever have the option to choose between anything. No dialogue choices or no actions present themselves. The reason for this is because its what known as a kinetic novel. Your main goal as a reader is to simply enjoy the story that plays out at your own pace. There are achievements in the Steam release but these simply pop up after experiencing each of Vol. 1s eight chapters.Theres one other striking aspect about NEKOPARA and its the fact that Sekai Project doesnt really hide its eroge (erotic game) roots. Yes, this title was initially made for the 18+ audience but, being on Steam, all that content is not included. Fairly mature topics are discussed unabashedly, however, such as when Chocola and Vanilla are in heat just like regular old cats.Despite nothing being shown, younger players should probably steer clear. I just have a feeling many may accidentally discover the game since it looks fairly innocent with brightly-dressed catgirls parading about. Depending on your reading speed it should take anywhere from three to seven hours to play completely.Closing Comments:NEKOPARA Vol.1 looks like it fits 100% into an outsiders view of visual novels; a dull, fandom-focused story with pretty girls who do nothing but dote on you. Yes, these catgirls are pretty devoted, but theres more going on than a simple harem storyline. One cant help but be intrigued by Kashous devotion to baking, understanding both catgirls, and wanting to see everything turn out well. With that said, some may be put off by the sexual storyline aspect which suddenly shows up. Others might be mad knowing theyve missed out on some scenes due to Steams restrictions on adult content. Still, NEKOPARA is a light and fluffy visual novel that fans of catgirls will enjoy their time with.", "date": "December 29, 2014", "grade": 3.5}
