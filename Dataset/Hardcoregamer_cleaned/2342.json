{"name": "SteamWorld Dig (PC)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=64601", "text": "Deep in the heart of the desert wasteland is the remnants of a town thats seen better days. The four remaining residents eke out an existence that barely counts as the robotic equivalent to living, but one of them has a secret. If hed lived long enough to pass it down to his nephew it might have done someone some good, but now the only way to find out what it is and restore the steambot town of Tumbleton is to grab hold of your uncles trusty pickaxe and get digging. Theres good ore and a deadly secret deep in the earth, and neither will excavate themselves.SteamWorld Dig: A Fistful of Dirt is a mining game in the classic style, loaded with personality and set in a fun world that hints at being much larger than what we see here. Rusty is a mining steambot digging deep into the earth to pull up anything he can sell in order to afford upgrades to make the next excursion that much more profitable. New tools are found in special areas that get marked on the mini-map when he gets within range, but upgrading them to their full potential involves selling a whole lot of ore. A stronger pickaxe or faster drill to get through the earth as it gets harder to break the deeper you go, or a bigger backpack to fit more goodies in, or even just a longer-burning light all go a long way towards mounting a proper mining expedition.The mine is cleaned out in the usual style for this type of game, which combines exploration, excavation, and some light platforming in a way thats far more fun than it may sound on paper. You dig through squares of dirt and rock searching out ore, but your time in the mine is limited by a circle of light that gets smaller and smaller as Rustys lamp burns through its fuel. The light lets you see whats in the ground, whether its ore, a sleeping monster, or just harmless earth, and when it runs out its time to head back to the surface and cash in no matter how empty the backpack may be. Turning in ore has two effects- instant cash to spend on upgrades, and the total take earned throughout the game levels up the town. Merchants get in new stock and eventually new townsfolk open up shop, selling even more powerful upgrades. Youll never have enough cash to empty out a store, though, and this can lead to some tough choices in the upgrade path. Skimp on dynamite to get that new lamp, or forget both for now and pick up a better drill and pickaxe? If youre obsessive about cleaning out the mine youll be able to afford everything eventually, of course, but making the best choice for right now can be surprisingly tricky.Once the decision has been made its back to the mine and the next excavation, introducing dirt and monsters to the sharp end of the pickaxe and searching for the next new ability. New skills are found in sub-mines, little doorways clearly marked as interesting places to explore. Some doorways lead to puzzle rooms with lots of high-quality ore as a reward, but the doors with signposts have steambot upgrades like a dash move, the drill and rocket punch abilities, shock absorbers so long falls dont cause damage, and more. By the time Rusty gets to the deepest depths hell be a fully tricked-out steambot who can dash and double-jump anywhere he likes, so long as the laser fire of wall sentries and charging kamikaze-bots dont swat him from the air. The cheap garbage of near the top of the mine gives way to much nicer and more valuable goodies deep down, and its all but impossible to pass by a deposit without seeing what it is. Thankfully nothing disappears, so if your backpack is full the ore sits there until you come back, so theres no penalty for indulging your curiosity on the way back to the surface.Closing Comments:SteamWorld Dig is a fantastic little mining game, filled with charm and as satisfying to play as any game in its genre. Rusty is a fun steambot to control, and the platforming and traps that take advantage of the upgrades he earns as he journeys deep underground do an excellent job of adding variety to the digging. If theres one drawback its that when the game is over, its 100% complete, with no new game plus or new characters to play as, no Hard mode, and the mine isnt randomized.Update- So the mine is randomized somewhat, as it turns out. Theres no one true path to the end that you can practice over and over again to perfect your speed run times, because ore and cave locations wont be in exactly the same place. They caves have to be in the same order to give new abilities out properly, of course, and because the caves are puzzle rooms nothing inside them will change from one play-through to the next, but for the 95% of the game youre not in a cave its all randomized within certain parameters. Apologies to the fine game makers of Image & Form for getting that one wrong.", "date": "December 5, 2013", "grade": 4.5}
