A tower defense game thats been given a nice, clean polish sounded exciting since the genre had been lacking as of late. As with many tower defense games, Defenders of Time keeps it simple; you plop a few gunners around and hope you can keep up with the swarms. Now that weve gotten our hands on it, however, simplicity might be the problem.Defenders of Time isnt far removed from something found on a kids website where monkeys pop balloons. One of the few things that differentiates it from the pack is allowing players to get in the enemies way. Gunners can be placed practically anywhere as long as they dont entirely block the exit for the swarms. Of course, why would you want to keep them alive? Yes, lets allow these vile creatures to leave the war zone that youve strategically set up. It doesnt entirely make sense but thats how it goes. One of the best ways to exterminate them is to place the gunners in a maze-like pattern to utilize the range of their attacks. Youll go through the typical up-grade sequences. Gunners are made more powerful after enough money is earned. Some will be able to freeze the enemies and some will constantly fire off attacks even when something isnt in range. There will be slow, fast, tough and flying enemies. The longer you last the more difficult it gets. Defenders of Time doesnt break the mold when it comes to the actual gameplay mechanics. You literally just place your gunners around where you think its strategically effective.Multiplayer is where Defenders of Time gains a little bit more of a reason to play. When you get to duke it out with someone else itll keep you on your toes. Maps will differ in difficulty which generally means a larger area to cover and multiple paths or exits for the creep enemies (same goes for single player). You never know where the gunners can be placed when facing someone; they might have a worse strategy than you. At least you can even form teams to make the battles one huge mess. One of the challenges youll face is theres no way to pause any of the action. Once the first wave of little creeps comes out, thats it; you need to buckle down and focus. Theres no way to stop and think. And thats good, it keeps you engaged and constantly upgrading your gunners.Defenders of Time hasnt shown off as much change than as we thought it would have. The graphics and style are nice for the genre; theres an early 1950s feeling of futuristic ideals. Similar to something out of Disneys Tomorrowland or Fallouts robotic designs. As theres nothing time-related in the actual combat, this is probably the only reason for the games title. The gunners are polished and streamlined with a lot of chrome and a paint job reminiscent of those motorcycles on a carousel youd see at a state fair. The music, however, is lackluster and repetitive. It does match the games them, but could have been given more tracks. Closing Comments:Unfortunately, Defenders of Time isnt the fresh breath of air the tower defense genre needed, instead washing into the ocean of its never-ending entries. Casual strategy fans will find it enjoyable, as it has enough grounded ideas to keep things engaging in short bursts, but theres nothing remotely unique here. With loads of improvements and more content for single player modes, Defenders of Time would be a worthwhile. Unless that happens, however, itll be lost at sea forever.", "date": "November 10, 2014", "grade": 2.0}
