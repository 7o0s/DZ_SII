The first game was Breakout, the second was techno-Pitfall, etc. They combined simple gaming with brutal difficulty and a great beat, and the retro-70s aesthetic gave each one a distinct look. The Bit.Trip series may have come to an end with Flux, but Commander Video has returned in Runner 2: Future Legend of Alien Rhythm. Its an all-new look coupled with a more forgiving difficulty level, and easily the best in the series so far.Runner 2 takes the gameplay of Bit.Trip Runner and gives it a makeover. Commander Video runs left to right automatically, and you need to jump, slide, and kick your way to the levels end while collecting the gold along the way. You dont technically need to get all of it, of course, but its hard to resist the urge for perfection, especially when the world map shows which levels have been cleared perfectly and which havent. Unlike Bit.Trip Runner, the item placement is designed to be challenging rather than maddening, so collecting everything feels like doing the job right.Each level follows roughly the same format. You start with a few warm-up obstacles, collect gold along the way as things get more complicated, and midway through theres a checkpoint you can either run through or jump over. For practicing levels it makes sense to use the checkpoint, but theres a nice bonus for surviving without it. Each level is exactly the same every time, so the trickier areas can be more about training muscle memory than exercising the reflexes. Jump an obstacle, jump again to get a gold in the air, come down in a slide to go under a fireball, and then jump-slide through a tiny gap in mid-air. Its hard the first five or six times, and then you just glide on through.Learning the timing is helped by Runner 2s music, because all obstacle placement is set to the rhythm. The music starts off as a basic beat, and there are four red crosses throughout the level that fill in the audio details as theyre collected. Moving past an obstacle also adds a beat to the rhythm, so sorting out the timing on jumps and gold collection is as much about knowing the rhythm of the music as it is looking at object placement. Just hitting the jump button doesnt make a noise, but clearing the spiky ball gives a tone exactly as you pass over it. The game is still more platformer than rhythm game, but the obstacles become the musical notation of the levels song.While the music fits in perfectly with the gaming, the new visual style is more of a mixed bag. Theres still a 70s look to everything, but the Atari 2600 style has been replaced with a blockier aesthetic thats ripped straight from a modernist 70s textbook cover. Its only seen in cut scenes and between-level art, and the best that can be said is that its visually interesting. The in-level art comes across a bit better, but some of the designs for the playable characters aim for wacky but end up hideous. One of the first characters you unlock is a running pickle. Some branching paths have treasure chests with alternate outfits, so if you want to scar your eyeballs you can dress up the pickle in hayseed overalls. Seriously, why would anyone do that!? Just because the character design is an intentional nod toward horrible art doesnt make it any less horrible.Closing Comments:", "date": "March 14, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
