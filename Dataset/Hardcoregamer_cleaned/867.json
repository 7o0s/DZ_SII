{"name": "Featherpunk Prime", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=224314", "text": "As weve seen just from these past months alone, it takes a special kind of game to stand tallest amid the never-ending (not that thats a bad thing) escapade of indie titles identifying strongly with classically-tested genres. Be it 2D platformers, twin-stick shootersor a potential combination of both. Weve already had some notable examples this year of all three and be it through atmosphere, gameplay or general aesthetic, you can be sure developers of all shapes and sizes arent afraid to push the boat out  sometimes in quite extroverted ways  to stand even a faint chance of lasting longer the initial release buzz. Superhatch dont appear to be all too shy or otherwise cautious with that same mentality when it comes to a platformer-shooter hybrid of their own. Featherpunk Prime, as its name may already allude, is most certainly not a straight-faced or otherwise dilute affair.But like all things, theres a limit to ones leftfield imagination. No matter how cooky the premise may be  a World of robotic bird-like creatures, both good and evil alike, shooting each other in classically arcade-like, trigger-happy bombardments  the stature and integrity to its gameplay will always be scrutinised, one way or another. So looking past the illustriously comical visuals and firework-esque adorning of effects, is Featherpunk Primeat the end of the daya fun game to play? Certainly this isnt the first game in all of history to offer a hybrid of genre conventions (action-paced shooting and grid-like platforming design), let alone delivering that frustratingly beloved of tower-climbing, die-and-you-have-to-start-all-over pressures among players. Pressure has always been an advent for video game longevity, the question is how long it specifically lasts.In that sense, Superhatch wont be gaining brownie points for offering something entirely new, even if the duck-and-dive, weaving in-and-out play-style to its combat does at least mitigate some of the early concern on the games initial appeal. Featherpunk Prime, as hinted, feels partly (at its best) a homage to the Bubble Bobble-like ascend/descend until death loop of gameplay. The premise primarily revolving around the task of climbing the in-game ominous bad-guy tower, blowing ever-increasing amounts of robotic minions to pieces  battling past a string of larger, more menacing bosses along the way  until the job is done. Naturally, should you fall within any of the games six-floor phases, its back to the start of that particular point to climb the tower once more. Fortunately, check-points that come at the end of each section mean that restarting will not mean a literal return to ground level, rather allowing for a reasonable punishment without ever feeling overly impossible to accomplish the end goal. Minus the boss floors at every sixth entry, each floor is essentially a grid structure of ninety-degree aligned floors and walls. Littered throughout these floors are enemies that, while arent required to be destroyed, offer what the game refers to as Tekcells, serving as the games XP that allow you to upgrade your controllable robotic bird at any opportunity mid-game via a simple hit of the menu button. Be this with increased health, increased damage, resistance to certain traps, higher probability of critical hitsthough the upgrades themselves dont necessarily feel colossal or substantial upon acquirement, this is clearly an intention to balance the often hectic and quite exuberant presentation with a continuing degree of challenge.Featherpunk is for the most part a more strategic aligned of twin-stick shooters; not quite as number-crunching as an RPG, but inherits enough of that familiar tactile involvement to prevent itself ending up being a mindless run-and-gun affair. Sadly, outside of the initial loop of running around, shooting a few bad guys and reaching the next available lift, Featherpunk Prime doesnt quite evolve from out what feels like a very safe and stagnant design principle. Though floors, post-death, do change on repeat returns  nullifying any opportunity to simply speed through  youre likely to see roughly the same layout at least twice in each of the six-floor sections. Whats more, aside from a simple palette swap, not much of the games art-style or variance in enemy design feels wholly different.Later floors will of course bolster higher-level threats  and there are on occasion, debutants that not only shake things up, but demand you make best use of your agile maneuverability, something of which that isnt really expanded upon a lot throughout  and while enemies do offer different classes of attack (short-range, long-range, explosions), there comes a point very early on, saddening as it is to declare, where you feel like youve [already] been through this exact set-up. The only difference being enemy health-bars (which show up on-screen) now have slightly more HP. Perhaps one of the few graceful shake-ups to be found comes in the form of boss fights themselves and while only four in number, definitely feel like the games more strenuously tactical and thus, anxious of moments when the difference between success and failure can be found in something as minor as landing the double-jump perfectly or not letting ones manic stick-flicking get the better of you. Though, like the regular enemies, bosses do feel like mere bullet sponges at first, the variety in attack patterns and the sheer edge-of-your-seat uncertainty on whether youre even going to survive does offer some much-needed excitement and genuine fun for what, outside of boss battles, feels like too much reliance on safe repetition.There are of course unlockables to seek out and the craving to get just that bit extra XP lying about on the floor  the potential to lose even more health ever-present, something of which comes in very scarce amounts and does at least give the game a lethally riskier edge at points. In this regard, Featherpunk does sustain a dangling-carrot level of appeal and the need to get stronger and obtain the maximum levels in each of your abilities may  and probably will  lead some to mistakenly lose more health than that which theyve recouped. But in the end, all these momentary decisions and short-term bursts of enjoyment end up recycled back into the very same game-loop that unfortunately plays out over and over again without any real shift in presentation. Closing Comments:Smaller loops of gameplay dont inherently make a game weaker, providing each of these loops offer enough variety and degree of interaction to feel compelling and otherwise fun to play. While the gameplay found in Featherpunk Prime does offer some momentary enjoyment on each of its self-contained floors, the frustrations lie with how reliant the game feels on the same design structure aspects and same layout in each of its floors; the repetitiveness eventually begins to grate. The hybrid of shooting and platforming adds a lot to the appeal and the twin-stick shooter mechanics shine brightest of all involved, but for all the short-term delights, Featherpunk Primes safe familiarity makes the end-game feel far less desirable.", "date": "September 8, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
