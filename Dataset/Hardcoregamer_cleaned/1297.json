{"name": "Last Horizon", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=178364", "text": "The universe is a lonely place. Its filled with planets and asteroids, black holes and stars, but without other people, its just a vast expanse of empty, albeit beautiful, scenery. After the remaining survivor of a dead civilization leaves its desolate, broken planet, the only hope for survival is to find another home. Last Horizon is a journey of second chances through an indifferent but hazardous universe, scavenging what you can to build a new world on Planet X.The rocket ship sits on the remains of its planet, pointing into the sky and ready to depart. It has plenty of space to carry terraforming materials but the state of its world means the hold is empty. Transforming Planet X into a proper thriving world will take more than a tank of rocket fuel and breathable air, so there are going to be some necessary stops to harvest biomes along the way. Regular planets have three resources to find for minerals, fuel, and air, but special planets support life in a variety of environments. Jungle, arctic, ocean, volcanic, tundra, desert, and many more are scattered along the path to the new homeworld, and some planets even have mining colonies or other inhabitants to pick up. You dont need to find every resource planet on the journey, but too few means a boring or lonely new world, if you survive to reach it.Last Horizon is a simple game, and designed to be completed a time or two in a single sitting. The entire controls come down to three buttons- rotate left, rotate right, and thrust. Harvesting resources is done automatically by landing on a planet, whether it be biomes or supplies or colonists, but simplicity doesnt mean failure is easily avoided. Air is running down constantly, asteroids or bad landings damage the ship, gravity and thrust need to be managed for a clean landing, and the fuel tank is only so large. Each planet has a little of all three resources, and more often than not in enough supply to top off the ship, but its still very easy to take a damaged ship in too hard and bounce off a mountain, or get toasted by a sun while trying to harvest the desert biome off a planet thats a bit too close for comfort. Go exploring too far off the beaten track and youll run out of gas to drift aimlessly, but not forever due to asphyxiation when the air runs out. Carelessness kills, but so do the red enemy ships and, sometimes, the neutral purple ones if youve accidentally antagonized them. The universe is completely indifferent to your survival, and its not the black holes fault it crushes the ship to nonexistence if you get too close. Simple as it is, though, Last Horizon is also a lovely chill-out game. There are many ways to die, but nothing a bit of experience cant lessen, and then the game becomes one of managing a few basic resources while exploring a very pretty 2D universe. Giant suns give space a glowing red aura, planets radiate color into the cosmic dust, black holes pulse with dark gravity, and the ship flies onward through it all, guided by its compass and the arrows indicating points of interest past the edges of the screen. Its very quick and easy to fire up a quick run, dying or surviving for a brief but satisfying round of interplanetary exploration. There are four different runs to choose from, with the first three being of increasing difficulty and roughly the same from one run to the next but the last being truly randomized for heavy replayability. Its just enough game to let you feel like youve played something while still being nicely relaxing.Its also a bit rough and buggy at this point in its life, although hopefully future updates will address this. Theres no controller support, it doesnt remember to start in fullscreen mode from one round to the next and there are some odd behaviors in ending the game. I saw one game where I got the out-of-air message and the screen went black just as I was landing, then the sound effect of landing happened and the screen went back to normal, then I was starting the game over on the home planet. Another time on the fully-randomized run saw two planets merged together, making for an interesting gravity well to try to thrust out of. The art is pretty, the universe nicely atmospheric and the little sections of text add personality to what could have been a sterile little voyage, but Last Horzion really could stand one last round of polish. Closing Comments:Last Horizon is a beautifully minimalist game of exploration and survival amidst the planets. Its simple enough to be easily pick-up-and-play, but with enough challenge that a brief run still feels satisfying. The drifting universe and ambient soundtrack are properly relaxing, while trying to land on a planet for desperately-needed fuel while it slowly rotates beneath you and you try not to drift into the ocean or a mountain makes for a nicely tense moment of piloting. Unfortunately, bugs hold it back from its full potential at point in time. The void is filled with asteroids and other cosmic hazards, aliens wander between planets, the sun is not only burning hot, but in possession of a worryingly strong gravity well, and stray comets briefly light up the sky. The quest to find and create a new homeworld has plenty of room for disaster to strike, but its also a lovely journey through a vibrant night sky.", "date": "November 21, 2015", "grade": 3.5}
