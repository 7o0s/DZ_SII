{"name": "Total War: Three Kingdoms", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=331185", "text": "When creating a list of the most important PC exclusive games to have hit the market, it would be a grievous sin to not include at least one of Creative Assemblys Total War titles. The spectacle of the real time battles featuring massive amounts of troops of differing types combined with a limitless depth found in the day to day strategic decisions the player is forced to make yields a heady mix that simply cannot be ignored. The prolific series has covered an unbelievable amount of historical settings, as well as fantasy, so that there has to be at least one flavor that can appeal to a specific player. If that is what all the series did, take the excellent formula and apply a new wrapper in the form of a new setting, it could be forgiven. That isnt what Creative Assembly does, though, making each new title feel like a fresh twist on the established paradigm. Thus, its of little surprise to find that Total War: Three Kingdoms is arguably the strongest entry to date.As the name suggests, this hybrid of turn-based empire building and real time strategy gameplay takes place during the Three Kingdoms era of China. Starting in 193 CE, the land is in chaos. An ineffectual emperor is being manipulated by the maniacal Dong Zhuo, rebellions are breaking out and multiple burgeoning warlords are vying for control of as much land and wealth as they can get. A confederacy of sorts builds around the idea of ending Dong Zhuos reign, but even that is short lived after the immediate threat is removed. The setting, made famous by Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the earliest examples of historical fiction, provides ample fodder for a player to carve their own path to uniting all of China under their rule using one of twelve warlords as their figurehead. Each of these leaders come with their own abilities that provides huge bonuses to specific strategies, making for hundreds of hours of (mostly) unique, engrossing gameplay.This isnt even factoring in the two different style modes that are available. Each campaign can be played in Romance or Records mode. While the narrative hews closer to the one found in Romance of the Three Kingdoms in either mode, the Romance mode makes each of the named characters into powerhouses capable of pulling off the ridiculous feats found on the novel. Its not uncommon to see them wipe out a unit of cavalry single-handedly or engage in heroic duels to end a battle before the troops can even clash. Its simply a cool take, like if Dynasty Warriors decided to grow a brain. Those that are more interested in playing a grounded campaign with human generals can opt for Records. Here, they are just as vulnerable as the next person, despite their leadership skills, and must act in a more intelligent manner. The thing with the Total War games is that they have earned a bit of a reputation for being dense bricks of games that can be difficult to penetrate. Creative Assembly is aware of this and keeps working to improve the accessibility of their titles without sacrificing one iota of the depth that the best parts of the series leverages. This time around, they have implemented a new overlay system. Slapping the F1 key brings up the overlay, and simply mousing over a button or area on screen explains the function and how it could be useful. This is combined with a smart mission system that helps the player make smarter early decisions and get their feet under them before really pissing off the neighboring kingdoms. It must be confessed that, even after spending quite a bit of time with the series, the mission structure found here taught me the error of a few choices I enjoyed making in previous games. This is to say that Three Kingdoms is probably the best entry point into the Total War series.That isnt to say that returning players have nothing new to look at, either. Spies can be sent into enemy kingdoms, allowing them to enter the employ of the rulers, gain their trust and even cause civil wars. Diplomacy has been beefed up and the way their status affects their bargaining power can make for some tough choices. Cao Cao might be dominating militarily, but he could still fear the player if the player has earned the love of the people, for example. The way these dynamics come into play makes for some interesting situations where the player can come out with the better end of the deal. This is just a sampling of the many enhancements found in the package. There is a potential issue, though it doesnt really rest at the feet of the developer: the battles. These enormous melees are what caught the eyes of the gaming populace when the Total War series started out and for good cause. The amount of units on screen that the player can direct with a click of the mouse allows for some ludicrous, and epic, fights. It can dazzle. To some players, however, including this reviewer, these actions are beginning to lose their luster. During my time with Three Kingdoms, I found myself just kind of going through the motions. March to the middle of the field. Pause. Assign available units to attack the enemy that they are strongest against. Unpause. See what the enemy does in response. Pause again. Use blocking forces kept in reserve to occupy enemy troops that are attacking the soldiers on my side that are at a disadvantage. Unpause. Wipe out the enemy, occasionally making on the fly reassignments to consolidate when a foe is broken and another needs attention. Maybe its because Im handling the turn-based portions too well or I should up the difficulty, but the real time battle system needs a major shake up in Total Wars next outing. Even the new Duel system, where a heroic general can challenge an opposing one to singular combat, doesnt add much here.Fortunately, the depth of the turn-based empire management more than makes up for this potential bump. Playing around with the spies is fun and the diplomatic system does grab the attention, but the sheer enjoyment in building out an ever growing nation and improving its infrastructure demands that extra turn before saving the game and hitting the hay. It captures that feeling the best 4X titles can bring, just with a stronger focus on the Romance era of China. While it doesnt span the history of a civilization, theres just as much in the way of city improvements, technological advancements and balancing the needs of the people against the realities of the world to create a secure and vibrant empire that makes the people over in Yuan Shus province jealous. Theres more than enough meat here to keep even the players jaded with the series engaged, though they might delegate the obvious decisive victories to the AI so they can get on with making the world a better place.Getting those decisive victory predictions isnt easy, though. An army marches on its stomach and setting up an invasion isnt a cakewalk if the logistics arent considered. Without a supply chain, the army starving out a city via a siege might be left starving themselves, leaving the whole incident feeling like a commercial for a charity. Building up and affording to maintain the armies in the first place requires a shrewd plan of city investments and knowing the best allies to make. These decisions can be helped along by making the best choices on the Reform tree. Each spring, the player can choose a new reform to issue that can do things like unlock new building types or affect food production. Closing Comments: With an ever increasing amount of games getting console releases, the PC gamer can typically only point to having the best version of a title. Total War has always been a hold out and is one of the few AAA quality PC exclusive series left. While Total War veterans might be justified for feeling a bit of fatigue with the battle system, theres still plenty fresh in Total War: Three Kingdoms to enjoy. This is a game that brings an amount of depth that would be frightening if there wasnt also systems in place to help guide a new player. Its dripping with a beautiful style that evokes the era while still feeling modern. Indeed, the release of Three Kingdoms is an event. Just be prepared to lose track of time building that better China. Plus, its a bargain. After all, its three kingdoms for the price of one.", "date": "Bohn on May 16, 2019", "grade": 4.0}
