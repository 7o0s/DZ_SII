{"name": "Max: The Curse of Brotherhood (Xbox One)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=66997", "text": "Max and the Magic Marker hit PC and WiiWare a few years back, and carved a niche out for itself as a kid-friendly puzzle-platformer with slick controls. It didnt hit the 360 and PS3, presumably due to the marker functionality (although the PS Move shouldve worked fine). No controller-only version of the game was released, which is why it seems so odd to exclusively release this game (for now anyway) on the Xbox One  a console with no motion control device to allow precise drawing. Max was praised for being a good-looking game with fantastic platforming  a trend that continues here, even if other control issues bog it down a bit.Its a shame the game doesnt support the Kinect, because youll be pointing a finger at it trying to use the marker with RT to activate it, and the left stick. Okami handled this issue perfectly by pausing time around you, but it doesnt usually stop here unless its a big platforming section, resulting in enemies coming towards you really quickly and not giving you much time to respond. Fortunately, while deaths are common due to this, checkpoints are handed out after each puzzle solved, so there isnt too much backtracking and replaying required. Still, its a pain in the butt to actually get the marker to work when you want, and it seems to respawn on the opposite end of the screen you need it  which is especially odd since you can only use it on designated parts of the screen. It would make more sense to just have it start on one of those points rather than on one side of the screen.Fortunately, that issue doesnt do too much harm as the mechanics of the marker, the puzzles, and the platforming work well. While it feels odd to move using only the left stick since it renders the Xbox Ones swank d-pad useless in a platformer, you get over that after a few minutes of play. A jumps as youd expect and and as mentioned before, RT activates your marker. There are multiple kinds of markers available that add different wrinkles to the puzzles  the type changes based on what appears on-screen. Orange is used to build or break down land masses  a simple concept in theory. However, you will have to use that function wisely as there will be times when you need to build a mass, jump on it, then make another mass to hop on before destroying the first one in a see-saw battle to create a platform big enough to stand on. You can also use it to lure enemies into a trap, or simply move them around the playing area.Theres also a green marker that youre introduced to subtly throughout play. Youll see branches growing around you magically and think okay, video game logic  then you get the green marker AND CAN DO IT YOURSELF. Its so awesomeuntil you have to draw stuff. While youre usually given a smoke outline of what to create, sometimes you arent, which makes drawing the perfect lines needed a bit of a chore. This same issue hurts being able to draw vines later on and have to combine with the branches to form usable areas quickly. Fortunately, basic platforming is a breeze most of the time. Sadly, there are definitely some collision issues where you think youve nailed a jump because in theory, youve got about as far as you can to the edge and still dont make it, and then wind up falling into a pit. Between that and the drawing, the gameplay is a bit rough the edges. The sum is definitely greater than its parts though, because things usually click, and when that happens, the game is a ton of fun to play.The drawing issues are definitely a sign that this game would be better-suited on the Wii U than any other platform  its visuals would be right at home there too. Everythings bright and vivid, with a nice variety of colors used for each section. The character design bears a bit of a resemblance to your average mid-to-late 00s CG movie, and doesnt really stand out too much, but is pleasing to look at. Animation is smooth, while most textures from afar look quite good. Unfortunately, when youre in close-up sections, you really see some muddy-looking textures and its disappointing. This game was designed with the 360 in mind, so its not surprising to see it suffer from the same issue as many other 360-to-One games, but does hurt the overall presentation when youre playing it since youve got a brand-new system and this game shouldnt tax it in any way. In theory, it should look pristine and there shouldnt be room for any immediate improvement. As it stands, the game looks a bit less impressive than Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams did on the 360.Maxs visuals disappoint a bit, but the voice acting helps ease that sting. The cast does a fine job with a perfectly fine storyline  everyone takes the game seriously, which makes the brief cutscenes and little quips from Max seem more genuine. Max doesnt sound like a guy trying to sound like a kid  he sounds like a kid, and one who is confused about whats going on and wants to make things right. The big evil bad guys deep voice works, and having his face go unseen will remind me of Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget. The soundtrack goes for a basic family-friendly movie, so its both cheery at times and epic, with some ominous music thrown in too. Its pretty good stuff and fun to listen to in the game  although Im not sure Id be in any hurry to grab an OST since it may be one of those games with music that works well in the game, but not outside of it. The sound effects are cartoony, but quite good, with things like the ooze of quicksand sounding both funny and a bit scary as well.Closing Comments:", "date": "December 24, 2013", "grade": 3.5}
