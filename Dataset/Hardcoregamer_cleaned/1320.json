{"name": "The Devil on G-String", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=175968", "text": "With so many visual novels cropping up on Steam as of late, it can be quite a challenge to stay informed on all the new releases. Some are brand new English-developed titles while others are English-language releases of popular Japanese titles. G-Senjou no Maou, translated as The Devil on G-String, falls into the latter camp. This visual novel first launched way back in 2008 and shortly after received the attention of fan translators. Unfortunately, it took all the way until 2015 for a publisher (in this case, Sekai Project) to finally get the game out to Steam users officially. Now that its finally out  should you play it? Well, the answer to that question depends on the type of visual novels you enjoy, if you even tend to be a fan at all. For existing genre fans, you definitely cannot come into this expecting a cutesy, happy-go-lucky slice of life romance. Although The Devil on G-String features a fair bit of ham-fisted character building with trope-tastic girls, it quickly veers off that path to prove itself as a tale with some serious thriller credentials. On the other hand, for those not yet well-versed in visual novels, it may also prove a worthy choice due to its strong narrative and unreliable narrator structure. Of course, saying too much will spoil aspects that players should experience for themselves. Heres the basic of the storyline for folks, since the Steam store page offers little explanation. You assume the role of a young, classical music-obsessed man named Kyousuke. While to his classmates he appears just a regular high school student, hes actually heavily involved in shady business dealings due to his father being the leader of a powerful gang in Japan. This creates a ton of stress in his life and even symptom of forgetfulness and incredibly frequent headaches. One day, an unusual transfer student joins his class and shares that she is on the search for someone named Maou (devil in Japanese). This sets about a string of events which immediately shift things into a darker tone. Players will slowly uncover the story which is full of ample amounts of drama as its weaves the normal lives of high school students with shady underground dealings. Its important to not spoil much of anything for The Devil on G-String because its story is worthy of uncovering in full on your own. Although this might make it sound like a kinetic novel (a visual novel without choices) this is actually not the case. There are around ten to twenty choices to make during a playthrough and these can lead you down one of four different pathways. Although it may not be required to complete each one, super fans will definitely find themselves drawn to play through them all. Sometimes, the choices which lead to a good end are a bit unusual, though, so it may be worth checking in with a guide if youd rather not play guess and check toward achieving your desired path. The story writing is solid, and definitely has a nice flair in regards to its localization. Its just so powerful to see bright, cheery characters get wrapped up in this gritty tale. While there are a few typos to be found, its not all that many considering the amount of text contained within this game. One thing that might be a little odd to folks used to the genre is that character names are not displayed when someone speaks. Sure, their sprite generally is, but some characters dont receive that treatment such as the narrator. Its a bit odd, but not a bad choice. Each character also receives a different font color. Those who happen to have trouble seeing some of the colors can change them in the options. The Devil on G-Strings visuals are a bit of a toss up. For the most part, they look about equivalent to all the other typically anime-styled visual novels on Steam. While the artist could draw an average anime girl, however, drawing masculine men appears to have resulted in absolute monstrosities. One issue worth noting is that this new widescreen release of the title has cropped the artwork in order to achieve a 16:9 effect. While casual players wont mind much, it has caused a stir with some folks in the fan community due to sometimes obscuring key details in scenes. Another controversial point is the fact that both a voiced and non-voiced version of the game are available for purchase on Steam, with the voiced version costing double. This probably sounds super strange to many, but in Japan voice acting often costs a pretty penny (not to mention the often prohibitively expensive costs of visual novels themselves). Luckily, the Japanese voice acting appears solid and professional, but its absolutely not necessary to enjoy a playthrough. On the other hand, the music stands as a high point thanks to its thematic usage of classical songs. Of course, youre not going to have to pay extra to hear the excellent soundtrack play out. Closing Comments:A surprising amount of controversy has surrounded the release of The Devil on G-String on Steam, likely because it has such a devoted fan following. People feel so intensely about this title for a reason  it features an intriguing storyline that youll want to see through to its conclusion. Sure, the CGs are cropped, the Japanese voice acting is an expensive addition and there are no 18+ sequences in this version, but the most important aspects still shine through. Those looking for an engaging story to keep them reading for hours on end will want to pick up The Devil on G-String.", "date": "November 8, 2015", "grade": 4.0}
