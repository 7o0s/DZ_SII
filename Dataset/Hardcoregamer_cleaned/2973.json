While not a long title, it encouraged tons of replay and sharing secrets with others also playing in addition to just being a brand new Pokmon experience unlike any other. Seeing Pokmon out in the wild was nothing short of magical, and now years later the chance has once again come with New Pokmon Snap gracing the scene and revitalizing the beloved title. Its been a long time coming as fans of the original have wanted a sequel for years now, so just how well does New Pokmon Snap do its job?There wasnt much of a story focus in the original title, but theres more going on this time around. A young photographer is beginning their time in the Lental region under the service of Professor Mirror. Together with his assistant Rita, they are discovering secrets of the Pokmon living here in their natural habitat. During the time there, the Professor regularly mentions the rumored Illumina phenomenon which seems to affect Pokmon but hasnt been captured on film for many years and was believed to be false at that. The potential of it being true is just too much, and together the team sets out to see if its true while steadily learning more and more about the Lental region on every single outing.Just like the original title, the core goal of New Pokmon Snap is to traverse through on-rails levels and take photographs of Pokmon in their natural habitat. Levels are short, but after finishing players will return to the Professor where they can then have their photos evaluated. Higher scores will level up the area in which it was taken with every level allowing for new events or Pokmon to appear. Through the story players will unlock Fluffruit which is an apple-like food that can be thrown in order to attract Pokmon over to areas or simply to tempt them into eating. New to this title is the Illumina orbs, which will cause Pokmon or certain flowers to glow and act in new ways. A new music box can also be played to attract or wake up those who might be asleep. Some might dance, others may run away because theyre not sure about the sound, but theres tons of ways to capture Pokmon on film. Each Pokmon has four levels of photos that can be taken and saved in the photodex, with some requiring special events to occur to snap it at just the right time. A lot of thought goes into grading photos since everything from pose to the appearance of other Pokmon in the photo will help rank it up to be categorized and increase the level of the area. When all the photos have been taken after a successful trip the fun doesnt just end there, as theres a whole new online component that encourages even more creativity. In some regions of the world, the original Pokmon Snap had printers that players could visit and make physical copies of some of their favorite photos to show off or share with others. Now theres no need to print anymore, as the online service allows sharing and viewing of photos with people around the world. In addition to this, theres also an editing mode that players can use to decorate their favorites before they share it while giving it a title or theme that others might enjoy viewing. There are a wide variety of stickers available at the start, but most are actually unlocked through various means while playing through normal levels. Some require requests to be completed by capturing Pokmon in particular moments, while others just need certain types captured on film a multitude of times. The editing mode is simple, but addictive to use, as its fun to edit photos to make cute scenes out of a favorite Pokmon or simply adding to a wonderfully-captured moment.New Pokmon Snap is a gorgeous title. The original title shoved players into an unseen world of wild Pokmon living their lives with slight interruption from the photographer, but it makes it all the more endearing to keep going when theres so much to see. Although the core campaign itself might be short, theres tons available to unlock afterwards that makes replaying worthwhile and satisfying. Theres tons of secrets to be had and so many ways to capture a Pokmons attention for the latest photo, not to mention multiple ways to explore each stage be it during day or at night for variety. The music, while not standing out, is an enjoyable listen that gives every area its own upbeat vibe. The character animations themselves look fantastic, and the voice acting is a small but nice bonus to helping build the world. While the story is simple, it helps lead the way to new places and has interesting aspects that make it engaging while playing through. Closing Comments:When it comes to long-awaited sequels, New Pokmon Snap doesnt disappoint in the least. Theres so much more to do for those looking for a wonderful adventure through the brand new Lental region with camera in hand. The amount of time any player will get out of New Pokmon Snap will vary of course, as its a title that relies on people enjoying pure atmosphere and seeing tons of adorable or tough Pokmon in brand new ways. All in all its a proper and fantastic sequel to the long-beloved original N64 title. While New Pokmon Snap borrows much from its predecessor, it has plenty of new to stand up on its own two legs that builds an endearing experience. Hopefully it wont be another 22 years until the next entry, as New Pokmon Snap is so utterly charming that its hard to keep from wanting even more.", "date": "May 3, 2021", "grade": 4.0}
