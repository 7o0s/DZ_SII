{"name": "Color Symphony 2", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=181924", "text": "A precision jumper cross puzzle game, REMIMORYs Color Symphony 2 attempts to be unique through its use of the ambiguity of color. This ambiguity is the main theme, with the player utilizing an ability to shift colors. Doing so allows the player to solve various puzzles by affecting the world around them. A basic example is when a blue obstacle will not exist on a blue background. Whereas a yellow obstacle will exist on a red background. Three colors can be activated by the player  by the use of their respective keys/buttons  at any time: blue, yellow and red. The player alternates between activating one of the three to affect various obstacles in various ways. Other colors do feature, though they require the character to touch them manually. There is also a limited power that removes all obstacles of whatever color the player wishes. The puzzles  while varying slowly over time  rely on many of the same concepts, only progressing slowly in difficulty until moving on to the next. There are only so many spinning spike balls that one can jump over before getting bored.The game progresses upon the orderly completion of stages. A chapter is made up with numerous stages and all the stages in a chapter must be completed before progressing to the next. You play as a cloaked, scarfed and hatted man who returns to his world to reclaim all he has lost without knowing that everything has changed since he left. Yes, there is a story. The narrative progresses through each stage and chapter through text. Using text to provide the narrative is fitting, since the game has a heavy visual focus. The most noticeable thing about Color Symphony 2 is the art. Simplistic by default, the foundations have certain sense of style. Unfortunately, the various obstacles dont seem to fit in the world. Overgrown platforms that are riddled with long grass and flowers are offset  awkwardly  by unsuited helicopters and floating, spinning spikes. In its entirety, the game is visually satisfying, however, the lack of variation in design as the player progresses is a letdown.The textualized narrative is initially a welcome surprise. The genre isnt exactly renowned for its focus on story telling. At first, it is effectively plastered in the background of levels. Each line delivered sparingly throughout the stages. Unfortunately, as the player progresses, it is easy to forget about the text entirely, especially when  after the initial levels  the game gives little time for reflection during each level. Jumps need to be timed, homing bullets need to be dodged. Amidst this, it is incredibly hard to focus on anything else, making the narrative an almost invisible background decoration.The sound is excellent. While track numbers arent incredibly diverse, music is never intrusive or annoyance amplifying. Furthermore, the various sound effects are effective, with the death sound particularly cringe inducing.Closing Comments:Color Symphony 2 is reasonable in that it does what it sets out to do. Unfortunately, it doesnt excel in any particular way. The use of color is clever, if not completely original, while the puzzle and platforming design is competent at best. Nothing stands out in a way that says you must play this. Platformer and puzzle game fans who pick this up will have a good time, but everybody else can pass on Color Symphony 2.", "date": "December 12, 2015", "grade": 2.5}
