{"name": "Little Kings Story (PC)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=219754", "text": "A long time ago on a weird little console there was a hybrid strategy/RPG that spread a thick layer of charm over its semi-cynical heart. It told the story of a boy who found a magical crown granting him the right of kingship over a run-down village, with everyone instantly responding to his commands in a way befitting of an undisputed ruler.The new kings closest advisor was The Bull Knight Howser, providing experience where the boy had none and very obviously goading him into world domination. The kingdom of Alpoko grew with every new conquest, and if the boy recognized he was being manipulated he didnt seem to mind too much. Its not like Howser was the moustache-twirling villain of the piece, after all, but rather a knight devoted to the kingdom and sure of his goals. Besides, the young king got to adventure into the monster-filled wilds and receive the attention of a number of devoted princesses, and the villagers did the fighting for him. Its a good life, even if the rumblings of a pending kingdom-wide disaster are getting harder and harder to ignore.Little Kings Story never dominated the sales charts but did manage to build a devoted fan base. As the years went by it earned a Vita port that wasnt particularly well received and now its original version is available on PC. While the port has a few rough parts, its as instantly likeable as ever, with the simple primary gameplay loop being enhanced by a growing town filled weird villagers in a number of jobs, each with its own special abilities. Grab a horde of citizens who all line up behind you, head out to explore the surrounding wilderness, and send your peons forth to do your bidding. The controls are fairly simple, with the primary actions being Send and Return. Send shoots out one villager at a time in a straight line while Return calls back everyone, all at once. Pressing down on the plus pad organizes the villagers into job types and pressing down again sends the job type at the front of the line to the back. You dont want your soldiers to get mixed with the builders, after all, because theyre not very good at construction and just slow the whole process down. Its important to have a good selection of helpers at your beck and call because there are any number of different jobs out in the field to attend to, and clearing away a massive tree trunk from the path wont work if you dont have some helpful woodsmen along. Farmers are good at digging up cracks in the earth, archers can take down pesky Onii who throw rocks down on the path, soldiers are highly effective at thumping any monster that needs a solid whack, and even job-free children can climb trees to pull down otherwise-inaccessible items. While some professions can help out with multiple tasks, each one specializes in something and will have an obstacle or two that only it can get past. Once the kings retinue grows from its initial tiny numbers to a decent-sized mob hell be able to have a couple of specialists along for any situation.At the start, though, all youve got are carefree villagers without a job to their name. A little exploration and a few simple encounters opens up the farming and guard jobs, and more get added as the village expands into a town and eventually a decent sized kingdom. New buildings in town add more villagers and new jobs, and villagers get assigned a profession by their king. Add a villager to the retinue, point them at the door to the training center, and send them in to get a new, more useful member of an expanding society. Not all villagers can do all jobs well, though, and one with only four points of health as a guard might have six as a lumberjack. A four health point guard is very quickly a dead guard, so managing the crew is important. As the village grows the population expands, and while growth is accomplished by defeating a boss monster this can take a toll on the population until you get the hang of battle. Running away is a vital strategy, in fact, because a group thats half farmers isnt anywhere near as effective as one thats comprised of archers and guards. Odds are exceptionally high that youll lose at least a few villagers in a boss encounter, but theres a chance they may wash up on the beach safe and sound the next day, maybe. The other way to restock the village is to pay attention to the news ticker, which lets you know when villagers have fallen in love so you can collect them and toss them into the church to be married. A few kids running around the place can quickly replenish the population that got decimated by a boss fight gone horribly wrong. Alternately, so long as the boss was defeated, it awards new land to build more houses on, so that helps keep the population up too. Its all part of the day-to-day life of ruling and exploring a charmingly adventurous fantasy kingdom.Basically, if youve played Little Kings Story on the Wii you know what youre getting, and if youve never played it before youre in for a quirky little treat. The transition to PC has a few rough patches that really could stand to be addressed, however. Every new game first calls up a Windows options menu, letting you set screen and controller details. Why this isnt part of the saved options in-game is a bit of a mystery, and clicking past it isnt that hard, but it would be nice if there was an explanation as to why the 60 FPS radio button had a Not Recommended beside it. Other bugs involve the info banner running across the bottom of the screen, which can double up when youve got two pieces of information trying to display at once, and characters in the castle not realizing that its better to walk through doors than over the level geometry. Exiting the game is also a graceless affair, with ESC calling up a simple Quit game? Windows menu with Yes and No boxes. You even need to shoo the cursor off the screen after the game loads. Thankfully all these issues are cosmetic, and Little Kings Story plays just fine overall, but the PC-specific features are fairly weak in their integration. On the plus side, seeing the game run at 60 FPS in 2560 x 1440 makes it look as fantastic as a Wii game could ever hope to, bringing to life details that Id never seen before on the original. Closing Comments:While the PC port is a little janky, the actual game of Little Kings Story is as instantly likeable as its ever been. The growing town is a lively place, and the reward for defeating an enemy is seeing it get bigger and livelier as it expands to fill the new space. As the game progresses more and more options open up to allow management of all the information, and while a few of them would have been more helpful if they showed up earlier (like the ability to use the town podium to view a menu of each citizen by job and health and assign them to your task force individually), they do show up eventually and are quite useful, so it all works out fine eventually. Running around with a trail of hand-picked citizens, taking on quests and searching for loot to afford new buildings and new jobs, and sending your followers into battle only to call everyone back again to avoid the enemy attacks makes for a cycle of explore-fight-expand thats hard to put down. Little Kings Story is its own unique little hybrid genre combining simple strategy and town building with an irresistibly charming storybook presentation, and while its not quite a classic of the ages its elements come together to make a game whose flaws are completely forgotten while the warm fuzzy glow of the memory of its adventure remains strong.", "date": "August 5, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
