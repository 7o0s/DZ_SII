{"name": "Ether One", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=81266", "text": "Dear Esthers brand of purely exploratory gameplay driven by voiceover narration and environmental storytelling sent waves rolling through the indie game scene. Of course, Dear Esther itself was merely part of a sea change sparked by Ico years prior to its release, but its notable nonetheless. The influence of The Chinese Rooms debut non-game can be felt in a number of titles that followed, each offering their own take on the ideas behind it. The Stanley Parable injects choice mechanics (and a heavy dose of humor) to create a delightful metanarrative about the contradictory nature of branching storytelling. Gone Home places interactive objects in a more tangible, intimate (and literal) game world to tell a touching story of self-discovery. The Novelist populates its small beach-house with NPCs, and asks you to explore their relationships as you would a desolate island or bizarre office complex.Ether One takes the basic framework of these games  Gone Home in particular  and combines it with the intriguing narrative conceit of To the Moon. You are a Restorer, a specialist hired by the Ether Institute of Telepathic Medicine to enter patients minds and recover memories lost to dementia. Its an experimental procedure, and a lots riding on the session youll take part in during the game. Your patient is very close to recovery, but one misstep could easily trigger a relapse. On top of that, tonight might well be your last chance, as the institute is threatening to pull funding if you and the doctor in charge dont show results. Its game time.When I say game time, I really mean it. While theres been a lot of debate on whether titles like Dear Esther are really games, Ether One inarguably is. The game is a gauntlet of logic puzzles intense enough to make Myst blush, and the world is packed with hidden notes, collectibles, and vaults to crack as you unravel the mysteries behind the institute and your patients past. Mind you, if youre so inclined, you can play it like one of those non-games, casually searching for memory fragments and ignoring the puzzles entirely. In doing so, however, you deprive yourself of the games true depth.Though you start at the Ether Institute, youll spend most of the game exploring the quaint English harbor town of Pinwheel, where your patient grew up. Pinwheel feels at once desolate and lively, almost as though the townsfolk stepped out only moments ago. Their belongings are strewn where they left them, and their drinks and meals sit on tables waiting for them to return. Ether One manages the difficult trick of making a foreign place feel homey, and Id argue does a better job of it than even Gone Home. This is owed almost entirely to the games warm, painterly art direction and sound design so fantastic you can practically smell the salt air coming off the sloshing waves.Good as the game is at drawing you into its world, that world is unfortunately a bit rough around the edges. Though you wouldnt know it from glancing at the cel-shaded graphics, Ether One is built in Unreal, and Pinwheel is as haunted by the old specter of texture pop-in as it is the ghosts of its inhabitants. The levels are also a touch sloppy in places, with models blatantly clipping through each other (like the water from a river floating in the ceiling of a mine) and geometry thrown together in ways that just dont make sense. These glitches in the matrix are somewhat excusable, though, given the nature of the games dream world. Less excusable are the numerous typos and grammatical errors that plague the games notes, diaries, and newspapers. They completely take you out of the game, and they could have been caught with even a bare-bones editing pass.Fortunately, where it counts, the writing is solid. The core narrative is impeccable, a smart exploration of a frightening, incurable disease and all its ramifications. As someone with a lot of older relatives, this really hits close to home. On top of that, the voiceover work for the game is among the most emotionally affecting Ive heard in a game. Some of the exchanges toward the end of the game are positively heartbreaking. The game doesnt pander in the way of emotionally manipulative pap, either. Youre asked to infer a lot  nothings spelled out for you unless you earn it.Earning it, as I said before, is a bit grueling. There are broken film projectors scattered throughout Pinwheel, and you can only fix them by delving into the history of the area in which you find them. Sometimes puzzles involve physical tasks, like completing a shipment of cider, while others involve figuring out the details of an event  for instance, the destination of that shipment and the day it was shipped. Once you solve the puzzle, you gain a bit more insight into your patients therapy. The ambient story of the quiet industrial town is also quite compelling in its own right. Each puzzle offers up a satisfying challenge of your ability to solve problems, assess your environment, and make logical inferences.In the first area of the game, these puzzles are nicely self-contained, with all the clues you need to crack them found within spitting distance. Later levels have a tendency to sprawl, though, and the puzzles begin to bleed into one another. You have to run around increasingly large environments searching for subtle hints, and though the puzzles are still fantastic on a conceptual level, solving them begins to feel frustrating and overwhelming. Clues become lost in a jumble, useful information is spread further and further apart, and theres an ever-increasing temptation to just give up and ride the story out. It seems like a clash of design choices, but the difficulty keeping everything straight mirrors the challenges of dementia just a little too well. I can definitely appreciate it when a game forgoes base player satisfaction to strike a deeper chord.Not to say that these puzzles arent satisfying. Indeed, as they grow more obtuse and frustrating, solving them only feels more fulfilling. There arent a lot of games that can deliver a real sense of accomplishment like this, and you can count the ones that also maintain a strong emotional core on one hand. The game asks you to spend a lot of time really considering its world and characters, and I was more than happy to oblige. Ive already run past a review deadline exploring Ether One, and I can tell you that once Im done writing this, Im going back in.Closing Comments:", "date": "April 12, 2014", "grade": 4.5}
