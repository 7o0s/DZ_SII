{"name": "Squids Odyssey (Wii U)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=86218", "text": "Im a fan of the flinging things at other things genre that has emerged on the iOS in recent years. Birds with a short temper at pigs in helmets. Spears at viking hordes. Wads of paper at your elementary school classmates. Finally, Squids Odyssey gives me the option to fling what Ive wanted to fling all this time: squid. Initially an iOS release that just recently made its way to the Wii U, Squids Odyssey proves to be more complex than just a squid flinging simulator, attempting to meld fairly standard iOS gameplay (or Wii U GamePad gameplay, in this instance), with a turn based strategy RPG formula. As weird as it sounds, it works at times and offers a different enough approach to the genre to be novel for a little while.You start the game as a ragtag group of squids including Steev (the adventurer protagonist), Vahine (the girl), and an old mentor squid with stats you cant even alter just in case they didnt telegraph the whole hey this guy is going to sacrifice himself/turn evil/maybe both, heck were feeling crazy! plot twist that will inevitably occur within the first five minutes of this sort of game. The three of you are there to pillage treasure, but the temple also happens to house some sort of primordial anger ooze that causes aggressiveness to any fish unfortunate enough to come in contact with it. It would seem to me that a kingdom that is housing this sort of stuff in a temple and sealed it away because they knew how dangerous it was might want to at least post one guard there to deter neer-do-wellers, and the fact that three people managed to bust into the unguarded temple housing the ooze of doom means they are basically taunting some evil force to attack them. This inevitably happens, and the aggressive fish creatures soon take over several of the kingdoms of fishkind, prompting everyone to ask did we really forget to post guards there? Now Steev and his ragtag band of fishy friends must defend the kingdom and turn back the tide of evil, picking up new companions as the story progresses.The story attempts to alternate between telling some epic tale and some comedic romp, neither of which it really pulls off effectively. Part of the problem here is the dialogue, which reads a bit like fanfiction somebody wrote about their Red Lobster dinner between their salad and their main course because they were bored. I can tell some parts were supposed to make me laugh, and felt a bit awkward when I couldnt even muster up a smile. Dialogue only occurs in scenes before most of the levels, meaning you only really get a superficial understanding of any of the characters, although even if they gave you more chances to interact with them I doubt they would be able to flesh them out into anything much better. I just didnt care what was happening or who I was fighting for, and the writing isnt strong enough to get you invested in any of the characters or their cause.Gameplay is fairly simple, and you fling squids at other sea creatures until those sea creatures agree to stop bothering you. The game describes itself as a tactical RPG with turn based battles, and each of your squid has a certain amount of stamina you can use to position yourself around the battlefield or launch an attack on an enemy squid. Pulling back further uses more stamina, but also makes you move further and gives you more powerful attacks, so it becomes up to you to decide when to fling with all your might and when only a little flick is all you need. A lot of the levels have cliffs or dangerous terrain, giving you a chance to instantly knock out an enemy if you push them over (or knock yourself out if you are bad at aiming and miss). You also have four classes of squid to choose from, including the scout who gets a boost move which propels them far even with a minor expenditure of stamina, a healer which heals your other squid when bumped into, a shooter that has a long distance attack, and a trooper that has an area attack that damages all enemies around them and pushes them away. You quickly gain one of each, and as the game progresses you pick up more of each class to customize your team as you see fit.While there isnt a lot of depth here, the simplicity of the gameplay and the satisfaction that comes from flinging squid with your stylus creates a fun little formula that is moderately addictive. There is a bit of strategy here as well, as you need to be careful to not position your squid near edges or leave them surrounded at the end of your turn. This is about as simple as a strategy RPG can get, and there is a certain amount of appeal to a laid back version of a genre I love. Later on, youll face large boss creatures or monsters that can only be attacked from behind, so there is a bit of variety added every once in a while. Most levels are also littered with items that boost your attack or refill your stamina among other things, giving you a little extra strategy as picking up as many of these as possible can swing the tide of battle. The attempts to meld the intricacies of a strategy RPG and the simplicity of most iOS titles (which is what this game was originally developed for) works at times, and the relaxing nature of the game might be just what genre novices are looking for.Unfortunately for those of us a bit more versed in the genre, however, the game will leave you wanting more. Yes, you can recruit more squid along the way, but they ultimately really only have cosmetic differences to the squid already in your arsenal. Some might have slightly higher stamina base stats or slightly lower defense, but they will ultimately play the same way. The game makes a big deal of the hat system which is essentially the armor of the game. Hats provide you with different stat boosts, but the system is implemented very poorly and becomes more of a hassle than it should. Essentially, each of the hats you find for a specific class provide a permanent stat boost once you apply it, and then you can go out and wear any hat you want and have exactly the same stats. This might be great if you love dressing up your squid (and who doesnt love a good game of squid dress up?) but the fact I have to go through and equip every single hat whenever I find a new character I want to use is a complete waste of time.More problematic is the lack of difficulty in the game, and a lot of the middle levels I breezed through without so much as a backwards glance at the corpses of my foes. I was butchering more fish than a sushi chef, and while I love to fling squid as much as the next man without any sort of challenge the whole experience quickly becomes dull. I used a team of two scouts (with the highest number of boosts) and two healers (with the highest attack values) except on levels where there force you to use a specific team, and it was like I put in a cheat code for infinite awesome because suddenly the game became a joke. There is an item that I am sure was put in the iOS version as a means to steal money from impatient players that doubles the number of pearls you receive from battles, and once I had that I was rolling in pearls like the undersea version of Scrooge McDuck. These can be used to buy hats or increase your levels, and this only further helped me break the game because I am almost positive I was about four to five levels higher than I should have been at any given time based on how little resistance I was running into. My strategy quickly became just swarm as many enemies as I could with my scouts and keep my healers close in case any of the enemies managed to inflict some damage, which as you realize isnt a very complex or satisfying strategy.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 29, 2014", "grade": 3.0}
