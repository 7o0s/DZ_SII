{"name": "The Wolf Among Us: Episode 4", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=86455", "text": "Though hopes were high coming off the success its award-winning predecessor, season 2 of Telltales The Waking Dead has struggled to find its footing with a new protagonist and cast. Meanwhile, The Wolf Among Us  a game based on a much lesser-known comic series  has managed to be consistently great across its last three installments. Though this turn of events seems to defy expectation, we probably should have seen it coming. Telltales best work tends to hit from out of left field. Despite that, its more or less inevitable that a long episodic series like this will hit a lull, and for The Wolf Among Us, episode 4 appears to be that lull.A Crooked Mile left off on one hell of a cliffhanger. Bigbys first encounter with the psychotic Bloody Mary left him appropriately bloodied and broken, with Snow forced to hand over Crane just to get her to spare the wolfs life. Episode 4 kicks off as Bigby awakens on his couch, a trail of blood on the floor (which is a bitch to get out of hardwood, so Im told) from when Snow and Doctor Swineheart dragged him in. The doctor is tending to Bigbys side, which has been peppered with shrapnel from Marys silver hollow points. Bigby might not actually be a werewolf, but silver affects him just the same, and Swineheart says he needs to get out every fragment or Bigbys life could be in danger. I suspect this is foreshadowing of events to come, though it would be disappointing to see Telltale hit the same plot point that killed Boy Blue in the comics.Bigbys arm has also been totally shattered, but thats not a huge problem. He can set it himself and let his healing factor take over  which he does in a delightfully disconcerting quick time event. While Bigbys getting bandaged up, Colin and Snow discuss his actions so far and wonder aloud about where the case will go from here. Its a little transparent, but it does a decent job of reminding you that there will be consequences for your choices, and of reinforcing the core dichotomy of Bigby as a man or a monster. In light of recent events, Snow vows to crack down on those breaking Fabletowns laws  including the ones about unglamoured animals being shipped to the farm. This leaves Bigby with the dilemma of whether to send Colin packing or stick by his friend. Of course, he has more pressing matters to attend to.Episode 4 is where the pieces of the mystery finally start to fall into place. Bigby has a chat with Narissa (the little mermaid) about whats going on at the Pudding and Pie  although the chats a little one-sided since her lips are sealed. The nature of the spell she and the girls are under is finally revealed, as is the way Faith and Lilly were killed. Bigby also goes to question Beast and Beauty, catching them in the middle of a domestic spat. From there, Bigbys investigation takes him to the place where the Crooked Man hands out his usurious loans, as well as the hub of his black market operations. What Bigby learns is determined by where he goes first and how he acts when he gets there.Though a lot is revealed in this chapter, it ultimately feels less substantial than previous installments. Theres plenty of intrigue and a fair bit of action, but the character development thats driven the series so far is largely absent. Bigbys scenes with Snow and Colin merely serve to cement their relationships one way or another, while Bluebeard, Mr. Toad, and The Woodsman are all given fairly hasty resolutions to their respective arcs. Pretty much everyone else he meets falls into one of two camps: put-upon Fables whove been coerced into helping the crooked man, and right bastards whove chosen to work for him of their own volition.We only meet two new characters in this episode, and they fit snugly into those respective camps. Johann the butcher (conveniently located next to the baker and candlestick maker) was muscled out of his shop by The Crooked Mans thugs, and is forced to operate as a front for the manufacture of their illicit goods. The Jersey Devil, meanwhile, is a total asshole who operates a shady pawn shop, and acts more or less openly hostile toward bigby from the word go. Ultimately, theyre both minor villains who dont get nearly enough development, and their roles would have been better-filled by characters wed met previously. I will say that I like Jerseys character design a lot, particularly when hes transformed into a monster. I just wish that he and Johann had been established previously.Of course, how much you see of each Fable is determined by the choices you make, so this may vary depending on how your playthrough is shaping up. Im pretty sure that I missed a scene with Jack by choosing to investigate the butcher shop first, and Im going to make a point of catching that when I make my second playthrough. That is, perhaps, the most important thing that The Wolf Among Us consistently manages to do right. It really feels as though your decisions make a difference beyond simply defining your character, and theres enough variation in content to give the game solid replay value. It doesnt feel quite as personal as your story in The Walking Dead, but its an intriguing way to tell a mystery. The only question left is whether it will pay off with alternate endings  including, hopefully, ones where Bigby can fail.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 27, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
