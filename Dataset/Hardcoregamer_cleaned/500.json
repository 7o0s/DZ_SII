{"name": "Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=258067", "text": "While many may point to its appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee as the turning point for the series going forward, theres little to argue against Fire Emblem attaining most of its now A-listed success through its most recent 3DS outings. Be it 2013s Awakening or last years triad of separate, cut-off releases under the Fates banner, the real catalyst for the series almighty upturn in success can no doubt be found in the shift these titles took, confining earlier iterations to the shadows of its handheld releases monolithic commercial dominance. The changes made and the revisions undertook, for better or worse, altering its underlying identity. Whether or not Fire Emblem Echoes is some manner of response  be it from Intelligent Systems or Nintendo themselves  to those eager for a return to the pre-Awakening (pre-Path of Radiance even) experience and/or unsettled by these recent changes, its clear just from the cover art alone that Shadows of Valentia is an intended deviation from the recent formula, mechanically and aesthetically more so.A deviation that chooses instead to return to Gaiden, second entry in the series and a Japan-only release that on the surface may seem like an odd choice; the games notably dry, minimalistic approach to strategy perhaps best suited to the experimental, side-project litter of series entrants. A game that is essentially that: a detour meant to appease and ultimately have little, if any, sway on the series inevitable future course. Or at least thats the presumption; what Shadows of Valentia represents instead, after a full twenty-or-so hours of exploring both its major overhauls and subtle differences in presentation, is perhaps the series most interesting and potentially divisive wake-up call of sorts. One that doesnt necessarily ditch or otherwise dissect its own standards in some vague attempt to find fault, but instead, graciously, calls back to a period of time wherein the series struck a fair balance between provocative gameplay and entertaining characters alike.Characters whom, outside of the ocassional RPG trope or stock template, dont appear as dispensable or as passive as weve come to expect from not one, but two entire armies worth of fighters. This is largely down to the games fully-voiced script and the fact that secondary characters  outside of dual protagonists Alm & Celica  are given a lot more time to develop and thus feel fleshed out beyond their meagre sprites and on-screen profiles may conjure. While not all of the voice-work is delivered with the same level of conviction or believability  with most support conversations, bafflingly, coming off as dead air with little-to-no warranted reason at being  the on-going banter and very many exchanges between characters, keeps the light-hearted folly seldom far from the all-round tales somewhat darker focus on the perils of conflict, creating an interesting juxtapose that further hits home Fire Emblems core themes surrounding war, faith, trust and of course, victory. To call Fire Emblem Echoes gameplay simplified or perhaps stripped back  many taking note of the absence of the [series staple] weapon triangle, not to mention the strength of an attack but a simple calculation of attack power minus an opponents defence/resistance  would be to undermine just how well the game takes into account the need to flesh out everything else outside of the fundamental components of skirmishes and story-based missions alike. True, the diverse and often interesting design of maps in recent games is in short supply here and unfortunately one of Echoes most obvious criticisms to take note of  the most blatant of environmental and terrain changes, be they vegetation, hills or fortifications of sorts, rarely altering what eventually turns into a common rhythm defining most missions. Fortunately, what makes Echoes resonate so well despite this, is the effort put into the spectacle and very mechanics outside of the games main combat pull to keep players invested in the journey onward.This shows up most prominently at the start of the games third act, whereby players gain the ability to take charge of both Alms & Celicas armies in unison. Choosing which army  and as such whose character arc  they want to advance across Valentias path-structured routes. Keeping a close eye on where enemy units are placed, their strength rankings and how best to approach it. All the while making sure that other units dont sneak up on the accompanying characters positioning, underpinning that consideration of when best to move and with whom. But Echoes goes beyond the nature of its overworld with stand-alone areas and systems of play that go to only add further depth and meaning to Valentias place in the series pantheon. Villages that can be visited and subsequently examined for items, characters eyeing up/sprinting into battle during in-game clashes as opposed to simply standing static post, the novel late-90s design to character sprites, bonus XP awarded based on a characters contribution post-battle. Whether its tied specifically to the gameplay or simply part of the overall presentation, while past titles might have latched you with the spectacle, Fire Emblem Echoes draws you in with its better fleshed-out World, delivering enough minute tweaks and neat additions to the plate to feel less like a remake of an old entry and at times like a completely new, stand-alone experience that can rival the heights of its 3DS brethren.Granted not all of Echoes ideas work as flawlessly in execution and its winding story that hops back and forth between protagonists isnt shy of throwing the odd predictable plot-twist here and there. The Fatigue aspect, for example, rarely causing concern, even when trudging through the games many 3D dungeons (which in themselves neither benefit nor hinder the conventions of traditional fights) while the simple arithmetic of combat rears far too many cases of bad luck to be simply forgotten. A double-attack with a success rate of 90% that both miss and an enemy attack with the same attribute at around 20% somehow managing to land a critical hit? While the dreaded miss is fairly common in the RPG genre, Echoes outcomes at times feel unnecessarily unfair. Even with these genuine annoyances, Shadows of Valentias sticking to the originals forte  removing the more supportive mechanics such as the ability to pair up units, in favour of this more calculative and thus critical deduction of which move to play out next  keeps the moment-to-moment gameplay seldom flatulent. Whether its baiting enemy units into certain positions or deciding which units take the role of weakening an opponent one phase and which ones ultimately finish the job to gain more XP, is part of the charm and Echoes certainly reestablishes Fire Emblems at times gruelling deliverance while at the same time not over-indulging in reward.Some characters and units may not gain the same level of reward from such things as stat boosts  seldom improving on more than three areas at any given time despite the increased opportunity outside of the main campaign  but whether its the introduction of Combat Arts based on a units proficiency with a weapon or indeed the return of forging weapons to higher levels, theres certainly little lost when it comes to diversifying ones tactics prior to the next conflict, but ensuring that such choices are within reason. Once again, the dread of permanently losing any one unit should they die mid-battle, isnt lost. Closing Comments:Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, by no means a flawless entry in the nearly three decade-old franchise, may well be the closest the series has gotten to somehow finding a happy medium between past legacy and contemporary appeal. Robust, entertaining and perilously engaging, while it may still find itself tainted by contemporary RPG standards in its character cast-listing or adamancy in offering more for the pure sake of it, Fire Emblems own remake phase in the end pays off in ways both clear and subtle alike. Ways that will appeal to either end of the fanbase spectrum. Its core gameplay and the many grid-based maps may not have evolved as much (perhaps less so here), but its everything going on around the combat that makes Shadows of Valentia a game youll look to beyond the avid necessity of leveling up your units. An interesting detour if nothing else, Nintendo would be wise to look at Echoes many entertaining and delightful offerings when the series, inevitably, makes its long-awaited return on home consoles.", "date": "May 24, 2017", "grade": 4.0}
