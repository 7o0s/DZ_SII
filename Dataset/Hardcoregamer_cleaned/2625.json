{"name": "God of War: Ascension", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=33175", "text": "It takes a big month of releases to make the latest God of War feel like just another game, but with Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance debuting just weeks ago, thats exactly what Ascension feels like. Of course, it doesnt help that popularity beings to diminish when a series passes its third entry, so even with a great marketing push and some of the most epic set pieces yet, it likely didnt stand a chance feeling like a must-play event regardless of the current market. That doesnt mean its not a fine game, and as part of the last wave of Sony exclusive titles for the console, it visually exemplifies some of the best the console has to offer. Based purely on gameplay, however, it soon becomes apparent why a great entry in one of the greatest series could be overshadowed by the aforementioned titles.Taking place years before the original God of War, Ascension sees a Kratos on the edge of defeat pledge an oath with Ares in an attempt to secure victory. Kratos becomes the hand of Ares and ravages through battlefields until he one day commits an act that forces him to break their bond. He quickly becomes imprisoned by the Furies, three queens who are the enforcement of punishment and bane of traitors. The Furies torture Kratos and drive him mad until he eventually breaks free and sets off on a quest to find the truth. While the plot does shed light on various aspects of Kratos past, it does so through a disjointed narrative. The series isnt known for rich storytelling, but its at least almost always interesting and coherent. Here, theres hardly ever a cutscene and the little scrolls scattered throughout add nothing. Those extremely well-versed in the God of War mythology will likely comprehend the gist of whats going on, but the pacing problems stifle motivation when youre unsure why youre battling or where exactly you are. Luckily, the story the environments tell is fall more enthralling. One need not look past the first level to see evidence of this, which takes place inside and around an enormous Hecatonchires. The entire level is alive, with multiple platforms attached to the body of the titan, while its appendages do things like break hallways and elevate them in the air. Eventually, you face off with the environment/creature one on one. While its an incredible level design that announces the games arrival with a bang, its just the first of many beautiful large scale stages to come, with another highlight being enormous mechanical pythons that must be ridden and slid through to turn a giant crank (humorously dubbed Snakes on a Train by the trophy). In additIon to the larger than life theatrics, theres well designed sewers, towns, temples and more to be traverse through featuring some tricky puzzles throughout.As unique as some of the environments are, its a shame that gameplay remains so conventional. As in all of the games, square deals a quick attack and triangle a heavy one. The two can be combined together in multiple ways to form combos and unleash more powerful attacks on your foes. Additionally, theres blocking, grappling and throwing. If youve played one God of War game, you know exactly what to expect here. Theres been a few new additions to combat, with the most notable being the ability to pick up secondary weapons from opponents in a system dubbed World Weapons that are mapped to the circle button. Five weapon types are available, including a sword, spear, club, shield and sling. If Kratos doesnt have a weapon, he attacks with his fist. Additionally, the magic system has been refined to allow weapon types to be changed between fire (Fire of Ares), water (Ice of Poseidon), lightning (Lightning of Zeus) and dark (Soul of Hades). Each one of these has special attacks that are unlocked through red orbs, while some grant special abilities such as breathing underwater.While both of these new additions offer a little more variety, the game still mainly boils to button mashing. Enter a battle, alternate between three buttons and dodge enemy attacks, rinse, repeat. Of course, thats not to say the gameplay is bad  in fact, its quite the opposite. Its the same the series is known for, but the problem is that this is an eight year old series and were nearing the next console generation. Recent action games have boasted updated mechanics that make the genre more fluid than ever, but God of War is content with pasting old gameplay in a new environment. If this was the first God of War you ever played and you hadnt experienced the aforementioned titles, combat would seem fantastic, but for anyone else its getting a bit tired  as conventionally solid as it may be.The most notable aspect of Ascension is the debut of online multiplayer. After years of being a solo experience, fans can now do battle with or against foes across the world as they appease the gods. Players first align themselves with one of the Gods of Olympus, including Poseidon, Zeus, Hades and Ares, unlocking their respective magic. While practically everybodys characters physically look the same (outside of selectable skin tone), weapons and armor can be customized to grant a more personal look and varied stats. Multiple modes are available, including Team Favor of the Gods (where players capture altars, kill enemies and open chests to earn favor), Match of the Champions (a fight to the death where every kill earns favor), Trial of the Gods (a cooperative race against the Hourglass of Olympus in an epic trial of endurance) and the self-explanatory Capture the Flag. For an hack n slash, theres a surprising amount of modes and maps available and all are quite enjoyable. Add fairly-deep customization to the mix and theres worthwhile multiplayer here that is something a group of friends (or clan) could get addicted to.Closing Comments:", "date": "March 13, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
