{"name": "Pokemon Platinum", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=32898", "text": "Its been nearly 10,000 years since Pokmon reared its head stateside. Since then it has become one of the biggest phenomena in history spawning a countless number animated television episodes and a smattering of movies each introducing new characters and creatures to the universe. The most impressive thing about the series, however, is its ability to spawn an innumerable amount of video games that, while similar, have continued to draw in a countless amount of prepubescent teens and school age children.Pokmon Platinum, the latest in the venerable series, rounds out the trio of Diamond and Pearl with what is undoubtedly the best Pokmon experience to date. Nintendo has obviously put in a lot of hard work. Pokmon Platinum sports a variety of new features and control tweaks that fans of the series will no doubt notice and appreciate. Even newcomers, once they get over the barrier of trying Pokmon, can find something they can truly enjoy.If for some odd reason youre not familiar with Pokmon lore, each story and each game starts when the hero, an aspiring Pokmon trainer, travels to the local Pokmon professor to choose his very first Pokmon. From there he/she must travel around the world battling elementally themed gym leaders to become the greatest Pokmon trainer in the world. Its a pretty basic story but one that camouflages numerous surprisingly deep and interesting features.As a rising Pokmon trainer you are able to capture any creature you meet in the wild by weakening them and throwing Pokballs at them. At any given time six creatures can be carried with you although a limitless amount can be stored in the PCs found around the world (though I still dont understand how an animal can fit inside a computer). Each of these aforementioned Pokmon have certain affinities which can be matched up against Pokmon with other affinities, creating an intricate game of rock, paper, scissors where water beats fire, fire beats grass, grass beats water, etc. As such it is important to consider which Pokmon to take with you at any given time. In addition the sheer number of Pokmon and evolution paths means there are a limitless amount of party combinations to choose from. It is safe to say that no two adventures will be exactly the same.At $34.99 the game is a real bargain. The story mode boasts anywhere from 25-50+ hours of game play depending on the players dedication to the gotta catch em all philosophy. Even without an overly obsessive personality there are plenty of features to stretch out the longevity of the game. A robust multiplayer battle and trading system allows players worldwide to interact with each other in both competitive and friendly ways. There are also underground areas just waiting to be explored and the addition of the Battle Frontier allows players to challenge themselves long after the completion of the main story.
