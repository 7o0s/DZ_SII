{"name": "Lionheart", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=265723", "text": "Stop me if youve heard this one. A young adventurer living in the shadows of his fathers greatness is traveling with a grizzled warrior who fought along side his old man. Despite the youths inexperience, naivete and general incompetence, within him lies potential for great power even though it hasnt been unlocked. Along the way they encounter other interesting characters, such as a razor-tongued female magic user, a priestess specializing in healing and a money hungry nimble critter with a sling. Oh, you have heard that one, maybe not exactly the same tale, but one close enough to it where the first time already feels like a replay.Thus is the story of Lionheart, a visual novel and RPG hybrid that clings so safely to RPG stereotypes that the exploration never feels like any new territory is being discovered. Thats not to say it is an inherently bad game, the interaction between the characters can be quite entertaining and on higher difficulty levels the battles do require one to make use of their strategy brain. It simply doesnt really bring anything new to the JRPG formula and results in an overall bland experience.Lionheart begins with Leon Lionheart, the inexperienced adventurer whose first and last name mean the same thing, and Orsin, the grizzled old mercenarcy warrior, arriving in a new city to explore the magic labyrinth known as the Libra Corridor. They are soon met by Justicar Maria Sinkirk, who happens to be in need of strapping young lad types to provide physical combat prowess to augment her spellcasting. Sensing Leon might have some power, she enlists the aid of these two in her outings after bringing attention to Leons inherent uselessness due to the fact he has reached his age and not yet gone through the divination. Yoda said the same thing about Luke Skywalker, but Star Wars is a separate universe than Lionheart so Leon has no reference point to defend himself, so instead we get to watch his frustration grow as Maria continues to jab at her with her serpentine tongue. These interactions occur fairly often, and that is one of the finer points of game where it gives personality through petty conflict through the otherwise cookie cutter JRPG archetypes. With ten playable characters, there are plenty of opportunities to be entertained by the less than graceful social interactions. The story progresses through visual novel style cutscenes. The exasperated expressions of Leon are a nice touch, as are the death stare of Maria when she is commenting on how fed up she is with Leons general idiocy. The protagonist and a party member having the comraderie of a cobra and mongoose is not anything new but Lionheart does know how to play that piece of the equation quite well. An especially good interaction is when Leon trips over his words after Maria makes some observations about certain preferences he has after a run in with samurai Kagura. Orsins interactions with the nun (aka party healer) Emma are also entertaining, albeit for different reasons.Getting out of the story progression into the actual game play, we have a dungeon exploration and battle system that is somewhat entertaining but best suited for short gaming sessions. There is a world map with various locations such as dungeons or fields marked that the party can explore, either to gather materials for equipment and lunches or to fulfill some grander objective or mercenary driven task. These areas are quite formulaic. There is a bar with certain event points marked at certain locations, like say at 10, 15, 25, and 30. The numbers may vary a bit but thats the idea. There are three ways to advance, Rush, Normal, and Cautious, each is done by clicking on the corresponding circle. With each movement the player may gain an item or have a random battle, and something will always happen at the fixed numbered intervals. Rushing will cause the character to cover a lot of ground quickly but they may not find as many items, while being cautious will cover shorter distances and yield more items and avoid some fights. Typically the 25 stop is where Maria suggests the party eat lunch to recover, and the end point is a boss. RPG vets should feel at home in the battle system. The player may have three party members in battle at any time but can swap characters at the start of every turn. Whenever it is a characters turn the player moves the mouse cursor over the enemy or party member and click on the action they wish to take. Some attacks use up skill points that slowly regenerate in between battles or if the character is moved into the reserve lines. Front and back row placement is a factor in selecting the formation, with the conventional wisdom of melee and tank characters in the front line and ranged and magic users in the rear applies. There are three difficulty levels, Casual, Normal, and Heroic, and they are pretty accurately named. Casual battles tend to go as smoothly as using an electric turkey carving knife on a stick of butter, which is due to increases in gained experience points and gold along with lowered health points for enemies. Normal results in battles that do require some thought be put into the attack plan but nothing that too insurmountable. Heroic can stomp the player pretty hard, but even these battles generally dont feel impossible. Heroic difficulty doubles all damage received and damage dealt, so its not just beefing up the enemies.Visually Lionheart is a mixed bag. The character models are a treat to look at and some of the spell animations are pretty cool, and the use of their different facial expressions in the dialog box does help bring them to life. On the other hand, a lot of the environments and enemies have some rather blase designs, and the limited animation doesnt exactly help matters. The audio isnt anything to write home about. The music falls deep into the realm the musical equivalent of stock photos of generic Western European derived fantasy, which isnt necessarily bad just very forgettable. The battle yells of the characters in combat, particularly Kite and Orsin, get annoying very quickly into the game. Closing Comments:Lionheart gets a couple things right, but overall results in a rather forgettable and generic experience. The best comparison I make to the game is vanilla ice cream; its not something that is going to cause a visceral reaction of outright disgust and repulsion, but it isnt anything to get excited about it. The dialogue between characters is entertaining and does provide some distraction to how lackluster the story is. The combat is fun, but because of how formulaic each dungeon is going through one or two of them in a sitting is plenty. Its a mediocre game that wouldnt bring about buyers remorse, but also isnt a must-play. This is an ideal title for people who revel in the idea of being entertained by snarky character banter enough to settle for average gameplay  approximately 50-100 hours of it. For those who enjoy JRPGs and visual novels, this may be an enjoyable experience that provides a good bang for the buck, but this title does not excel on either front.", "date": "July 27, 2017", "grade": 3.0}
