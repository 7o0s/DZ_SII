{"name": "Yumis Odd Odyssey", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=80056", "text": "Yumis Odd Odyssey is a puzzle platformer from a series that until now has never reached American shores and features a down-to-earth 20-year-old anime girl fighting giant aquatic creatures with a fishing line and a lure. To top it all off, its a Nintendo eShop exclusive. When all of this combines, you have one of the most niche games to ever be released in America. Nothing about Yumis Odd Odyssey is based in mainstream acceptance. From its art design to its concept to its form of distribution, this is a game dedicated to a very specific audience. Its not forgiving and its not inviting. Its a game thats likely to have a love-it-or-hate-it relationship with Nintendo eShop visitors. Yumis Odd Odysseys intimidating control setup and extreme difficulty arent going to appeal to everyone, but to those whove grown up on tough-as-nails platformers, its a game with a lot of content that rewards those who push past the many obstacles the game puts in your way.Yumis Odd Odyssey comes from the very venerable Umihara Kawase, a platformer series that dates back as far as the Super Famicom in 1994, but was never brought overseas until now. Starring a young Japanese woman named Yumi, the game focuses on navigating puzzle-platformer stages and avoiding different aquatic enemies that have disturbingly human-like appendages. The concept fulfills the promise of its namesake, as giant blowfish and eels will be walking (yes, walking) around levels like its an everyday occurrence. The bizarre and niche subject material couldve been the cause for the series overdue localization, but now that the series has finally reached North American shores, its tough to deny the games weirdness and absurdity. Its goofy in all the right ways.The games major feature is Yumis fishing line. Yumi can use the lure at the end of her line to hook onto surfaces, which she can then swing on, similar to a grappling hook. The line can be lengthened or shortened even when attached, and can be fired in all eight directions. The line can also be used to stun enemies and dispose of them. There are a ton of techniques to use the fishing line for, from hooking it to a ledge and rappelling downward to swinging from moving platforms. Its versatile, but it also takes a ton of practice to use. The challenge of this mechanic comes from two big features. The first is that you can reel yourself in or out on command, which changes the way you swing considerably. Similar to that, the second feature is that the fishing line is naturally elastic, so theres no one set trajectory you can predict. The physics of the fishing line mechanic allow for some downright superhuman acrobatics, but the game demands a ton of skill and practice to make these acrobatics a reality. The distinct lack of tight control makes the swinging and reeling feel very ambiguous and lax; it takes a lot of practice to master even the most basic of skills in Yumis Odd Odyssey. To make things even tougher, the games level design is anything but forgiving. The amount of precision required for many of the challenges, even the early ones, is hefty at best. This is a demanding game, one that encourages refining your skills with its signature mechanic and having the reflexes to use it wisely.But despite the difficulty and physics, Yumis Odd Odyssey does possess rather accessible controls. There are two main control setups, Standard and Classic, but the game does offer completely customizable button layouts. You can also use the Circle Pad for navigation, but the game requires you to turn its functionality on in the options menu (I preferred to use the d-pad myself). Different abilities like the time stop for more precise aiming of the lure are welcome, but the games most advanced uses of the fishing line require good ol fashioned skill and ingenuity to master. It cant be stressed enough how much youll need to associate yourself with the obscure physics to progress in this game; Yumis Odd Odyssey is a platformer that simply doesnt mess around.Yumis Odd Odyssey is a strangely constructed, but remarkably comprehensive game. There are fifty levels in the game and they dont all appear in linear fashion. To access later levels, you might have to visit a past stage and find a completely different exit, one that might be tucked away in a very difficult spot to reach. Following the beaten path will only get you so far; within the first fifth of the game, youll need to head back to other levels to find hidden exits to progress. Adding to the challenge are hidden backpacks (which are even more difficult to get), time trials to complete, and a total of five endings. Fortunately, the game offers multiple characters to choose from, each with their own special skills to try out. The fact of the matter is that youre getting a lot of content in Yumis Odd Odyssey, even if a majority of it can be downright punishing to endure. It may be a little on the expensive side at $29.99 US for an eShop exclusive, but if you can take the heat, youll find plenty to love.The graphic design of Yumis Odd Odyssey is rooted in Eastern art design. Traditional anime art, Katamari Damacy-esque polygonal world design, its all here. The homey Japanese town aesthetic is charming and family-friendly, with all of the kinds of objects youd expect to see in a slice-of-life anime like Azumanga Daioh. The graphics are generally smooth, though the frame rate can appear a bit taxed in certain places, and the levels possess enough creative architecture and unique lighting to be appealing. The soundtrack is subdued and doesnt rely on flashiness or spectacle; its humble to the utmost degree, just like the graphics. The charming character models hide the games no-nonsense difficulty, which is a welcome act that keeps you in a calm mood, even when the game is punishing you left and right.Closing Comments:", "date": "on March 31, 2014", "grade": 3.5}
