Every time I thought I was beginning to understand one of its incredibly complex systems, another granular command or mechanic would pop up demanding its own slice of what little brain real estate I had left.I endured the dull but comprehensive tutorial, however, stumbling through different combinations of commands through trial and error, I slowly began to grasp the incredible scale of Koei Tecmos latest strategy epic, finding myself beguiled by the interwoven history vignettes and robust tactical options. Once it clicks, Nobunagas Ambition: Sphere of Influence will consume your life.Starting as the daimyo of one of a number of clans spread throughout Japan, Sphere of Influence challenges players to expand their clan and conquer the whole of the country. Its a daunting task, and one not easily completed, but with careful strategy, persistent progress and ruthless ambition, your small clan will eventually grow to envelop the nation. Each turn, players will have to determine how they want their officers and clan to perform for the next month, making decisions like what each castle will increase production on (between crops, crafts or conscripts), which public facilities should be constructed next and which neighboring clans need their ego stroked. These are only a handful of the vast array of options and elements perpetually available for consideration, providing plenty of opportunities to custom implement tactics.Every system and mechanic is entwined with others, making each move significant and creating a world of realistic cause and effect. Theres a lot to consider and even more to remember, but the game is ready to offer suggestions on your next move whenever you need it. You advisor will pass judgment on each of your plans before you commit to them, saving you the frustration and time that would otherwise be spent scrambling to remedy your errors. As your confidence a tactician increases, youll see more opportunities for potentially unexpected strategies and slowly harness more and more of the incredibly deep systems simultaneously.As you grow your clan and influence, other clans will begin to take notice and become interested in diplomatic relations, or territorial conflict. How you handle those opportunities and challenges as they arise is up to you, but its in your best interest to carefully consider who you build alliances with and who you strike down. Diplomacy is a lengthy process, but it almost always pays dividends when the chips are down; when you eventually go to war, close allies (those with a high trust level) will send reinforcements to aid your assault, giving you an advantage against tireless foes. These are efforts that can help strengthen your clan, but there are also measures players can take to weaken their enemies before the battle even begins.Once you recognize discontent among the officers of neighboring clans, you can designate one of your own officers to meet with them in private and persuade them to collude against their daimyo or even leave and join your clan. Fewer savvy officers in the ranks means a less potent retaliatory threat, which makes conquering all the easier. However, your own officers can also be lured away if they become unhappy in their current position, so you must also remain aware of their trust levels and take the appropriate measures to keep everything peachy. There are a lot of balls in the air at once, but while it can feel overwhelming at first, the competence to balance your responsibilities and seize opportunities comes with time.Once a battle breaks out, the game switches into a real-time strategy system that has players commanding their soldiers as squads of units, directing their movements and using their commanding officers bespoke abilities to turn the tide in their favor. Though there is always strength in numbers, the game also prompts players to think their way out of tricky situations, like applying a pincer attack on a bulldozing battalion or splitting off into a handful of smaller groups to surround then enemy and overwhelm them from all sides. Its far from the most nuanced battle system out there, but it still provides tense, malleable, and exciting clashes.Nobunagas Ambition: Sphere of Influence is very much about man-management, be it simply monitoring your population, building your militia, or delegating your desires to various officers, but its also about history. Each of the games nine campaign scenarios comes with its own set of quests and objectives, which you can either decide to follow or ignore entirely. Should you play along, youll be treated to a reenactment of historical events, full of deceit, victory, and even love. The game does a great job of humanizing its characters, giving condensed explanations of their motivations and upbringing so you gain a better understanding of their desires and goals as events unfold. On the other hand, if you choose to blaze your own trail and write your own story, the game is equal to your ambition and will throw unique challenges at you depending on your decisions and political posture.For all of its merit as a strategy game, Nobunagas Ambition: Sphere of Influence is also a fantastic interactive representation of ancient Japan. Players will learn all sorts of information about the countrys history, like the contents of towns of the time, castle construction and fortification, and the many facets involved in maintaining and expanding a dominant clan. Its incredibly captivating, supported wonderfully by the orchestral soundtrack and bright, luscious visuals; Japan is a country that famously enjoys all four seasons and theyre all beautifully represented here.Closing Comments:Though it may scare off many players with its plodding pace and immediately complex array of commands, Nobunagas Ambition: Sphere of Influence is an engrossing and fiercely detailed journey through feudal Japan, offering a deep, lengthy strategy experience that simply cant be matched on PS4. Its not for everyone, but if you surrender yourself to its intricacies you may well find yourself crafting your own ornate strategies for victory long into the night.", "date": "September 28, 2015", "grade": 4.0}
