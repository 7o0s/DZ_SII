Thankfully, too, because with my recent Nintendo eShop history, Im well on my way to becoming a prime suspect for various Amber Alerts. You see, my library is littered with games of the Petz and Barbiez variety. Games that, despite my lowest of expectations, always end up disappointing me greatly. The thing is, I understand that Im not part of the target demographic, but truthfully, neither are little kids. There is no demographic for terrible games, and unfortunately for children, most games tailored to their level of ability are awful. Dont get me wrong, designing the most perfectest dress or cutiest kitty cant be easy for an adult with any semblance of self-pride, but putting a child through a game like Life with Horses 3D should be considered a low-form of child abuse. Ill explain why.Lets begin with the Story Mode, which is less of a narrative and more of a banal-task dispenser. Youre a young woman that just inherited the ramshackle family ranch. Naturally, breed bears no significance, and instead youre to choose only a color and name for your horse. With that said, the available names are dreadful. They range from crap like Ice Baby, to the more morning-shift stripper sounding Pinky, and play absolutely no role in the game. Would it have been too much to allow players to choose their own names, rather than provide a list of trashy part-time dancer titles? I dont think so.More importantly, the actual story part of the Story Mode is the laziest, least story-like series of events ever programmed. The only surprise is that the developer didnt make the goal to return the farm to its once prestigious prime. Oh wait, thats exactly what they did, and thats exactly what your goal is. The problem is, your rotten family really handed you a tumbledown stable, and theres quite a load of work to be done. Whatever glory this farm once possessed had likely washed away with racial segregation and competent bookkeeping, because its a piece of s***.As Ive mentioned, the Story Mode essentially involves completing repetitive tasks  the type that dont really seem like they would somehow lead to the expansion of your ranch, or improvement of your buildings. And also the type that are about as enjoyable as swallowing a handful of agricultural lime. Expectedly, these tasks are all horse related, and often involve grooming, feeding and everything in between. Unfortunately, the developers steered from realism and excluded stallion semen extraction. Theres always hoping its included in a sequel, however.While some duties are more interactive than others, such as brushing the horse  which involves the stylus and a bunch of tedious motions  the most challenging thing about the tasks is staying awake while performing them. Fortunately, the developers anticipated this boredom and included the option to skip through them entirely using Play Coins. If thats not an indication that this game is terrible, I dont know what the hell is. Essentially, the developer presents the notion that physical activity (rewarded with those precious Play Coins) is a good alternative. Thats worrying.Sadly, tasks that progress the story cannot be skipped, which is strange because theyre possibly even more terrible than the other, less meaningful tasks. For example, massaging your horse  which for some reason is part of the story  is about as appealing as it sounds. Yes, it utilizes some of the 3DSs neatest features, but it does so in some unfortunate ways. Theres simply no instance where poking or tilting a screen is fun if whats being displayed is dreadfully boring.Throughout the game, youre able to purchase land and renovate buildings on the ranch. And by able to I mean forced to, because doing so unlocks more activities in the Main Story mode which are required to complete the game. Unfortunately, it unlocks virtually nothing else. Well, except for feelings of anger thatll leave you tapping the screen with your stylus in vexation. The problem with this system is that, any remote feeling of progression you may experience is entirely shattered once you realize that youre repeating terrible tasks in order to unlock more terrible tasks to repeat yet again. Eventually, it became a lot like ingesting Ambien, only to immediately regurgitate it. Boring, sickly, boring, sickly  you get the picture.Additionally, the renovated buildings offer no extra or ancillary activities outside of story tasks. The few customization options are bare-bones, as well. Racing for example  another major part of owning this confusingly scattered and economically dumb horse ranch  is probably the easiest aspect of Life with Horses 3D. Fortunately, theyve nailed the realism, as youll be dodging static obstacles and tilting your 3DS when prompted during sharp turns, just like in real horse races. Sounds exciting, right? Wrong. The prompts appear early enough that failure would literally have to be your goal in order to miss them. Theres no sense of accomplishment, because losing would be enough to have your portfolio mailed to NAMI.Honestly, the only somewhat redeeming quality of Life with Horses 3D is that it isnt entirely horrible in the looks department. The horse models are fairly nice, suffering from only mildly stiff animations, and the backdrop  especially during races  is pretty, boasting bright-green grassy fields and blue skies. Character models on the other hand feature blank, expressionless faces that I like to refer to as the Grady Daughter Countenance. Its quite horrifying, actually. However, despite its visual appeal theres nothing worth seeing  even fully developed ranches are empty, without a trace of interesting anything.Closing Comments:The bottom line is that this game doesnt belong in the hands of children, but rather in place of shock therapy at an institute for the mentally insane. At least its mind-numbing repetitiveness can be used to bore crazies back to normal. Another more beneficial use would be as a form of punishment; kids throwing a tantrum? Nothing ten minutes with Life with Horses 3D cant fix. As an expert on childrens games, heed the following warnings: 1) this game is guaranteed to lower the IQ of any ordinary child by ten points per hour spent in-game, 2) if youre an adult, the only challenge is stopping yourself from registering on the sex offenders website for even installing the game on your 3DS, and 3) this game will bring nothing but evil to your home.", "date": "January 12, 2014", "grade": 1.5}
