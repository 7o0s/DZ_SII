{"name": "A Kiss For The Petals  Remembering How We Met", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=170515", "text": "Back in 2006, doujin group Fuguriya released a yuri visual novel by the name of Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o in Japan. Thanks in part to the lovely artwork, adorable characters and romances, as well as erotic content, one game blossomed into a massive series which now stands nineteen titles strong. Despite its rapid proliferation in Japan, western visual novel fans simply had to make do with fan patches  until now. MangaGamer finally took the plunge and brought the 18th entry into the Sono Hanabira series to English-speaking audiences via Steam as A Kiss For The Petals  Remembering How We Met. Not only is this a way for existing fans to finally officially show their support, but its a means by which to get many more unassuming gamers hooked on the franchise. Some folks may be more than a little lost, and deservedly so. For those visual novel fans who are unaware, a yuri title basically means that the game in question revolves around lesbian romance. Because this series in particular has made a name for itself as a rare mix of sweet storytelling with sexual content, it makes sense that people expect A Kiss For The Petals to offer the same. Actually, this is one of the very few Sono Hanabira releases which is completely free of 18+ content. Sure, theres still a fair amount of dirty jokes to be had, but thats about as far as things go. You wont get an eyeful of ridiculous fanservice ala the Sakura series either. Instead, the focus is purely on watching our protagonists slowly discover their feelings for one another. Its pretty obvious that the biggest reason this game was selected for localization was due to its all ages status. But, theres more to it than that. A Kiss For The Petals serves as a great introduction to St. Michael Girls School and, more importantly, the fan-favorite couple Risa and Miya. Despite being such a late game in the Sono Hanabira series, were introduced to the landscape with enough care to lure in newcomers. Its a pretty simple setup. Risa is a gal with a penchant for leadership roles at school, is well-liked, and extremely studious. She has just started her high school career at St. Michael Girls School when she crosses paths with Miya. Although she only glimpses her for a second, she finds herself aflutter with the hope to see this mysterious girl again.As fate would have it, Miya happens to be a transfer student who gets seated right next to Risa! The two make formative attempts at communication, but soon Miya starts skipping classes which causes Risa to become even more curious about her classmate. As the story progresses, we learn bits and pieces about both characters lives, but mostly we just view how their oppositional personalities spark off one another. And boy do they create quite the contrast! Miya, while incredibly intelligent, shirks school like its the least important thing in the world when Risa holds education with the utmost regard. The story continues from there, although not too much further.It may disappoint some to learn that A Kiss For The Petals will run most players approximately just two hours to read through. Although I cant say for certain, its very likely that the short runtime is related to this games original status of a mobile phone game in Japan. This also happens to be a kinetic novel, meaning at no point are you offered the ability to make a choice. You might be led to believe otherwise since the Steam release has achievements, but theres absolutely no choices to be had. Its not a dealbreaker for folks like me who have been desperate to see the Sono Hanabira series make its debut here, but definitely something to consider before purchasing.Luckily, the price isnt especially high ($7.99) and you receive a fairly polished experience. As with the other titles, A Kiss For The Petals features cutesy anime artwork and a bevvy of CGs. Backgrounds, too, definitely appear to have been created with care. Theres not a ton of variety to actually see, given that the game takes place almost exclusively in a few areas of St. Michael Girls School. Youll also find that characters are all voiced in Japanese. Both Risa and Miya feature lovely voice acting performances. Background characters such as Girl A, well, they dont have nearly the same treatment. The voice work for them isnt so bad that it becomes grating, but it really blends together making it sound like everyone who is not Risa or Miya might as well be the same classmate. Music follows the story with a generally light-hearted tone and friendliness that encapsulates the mood of the visual novel quite well. All in all, this is a quality release  especially when compared to some of its visual novel contemporaries on Steam. Closing Comments:The biggest determinant of whether you will enjoy A Kiss For The Petals  Remembering How We Met or not is if you are a fan of cute, vignette-style storytelling. This is just an incredibly brief glance into the lives of two characters as they discover their budding romantic feelings. Theres not much development of any other story themes, as those are embellished further in other games. Even so, youre still getting a peek into the Sono Hanabira world which has amassed a massive fan following of women and men. Theres a reason why this series has so many darn games and youll get a glimpse of why by taking this visual novel for a spin. Or, you could just wait and hope that this title proves successful enough for MangaGamer to release a more substantial entry in the future.", "date": "October 6, 2015", "grade": 3.5}
