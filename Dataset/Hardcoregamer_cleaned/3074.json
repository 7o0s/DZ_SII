{"name": "Sackboy: A Big Adventure", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=392141", "text": "Media Molecules fame stems from two things: their excellent creation tools and Sackboy. The adorable champs been hopping around since 2008, but his LittleBigPlanet outings have felt overshadowed by the creation tools. Media Molecule has since moved onto Dreams, leaving Sackboy in the hands of Sumo Digital. Now, at the PS5s launch, we have a new adventure with Sackboy, and this time, hes the star of the show. Is Sackboy: A Big Adventure a platforming title worthy of the lovable character?Sackboy: A Big Adventure takes place in the idyllic land of Craftworld. One peaceful day, Sackboys home is raided by the menacing Vex, bringer of fear and chaos. He intends on turning Craftworld into a living nightmare and kidnaps Sackboys friends to force them to build his Topsy Turver device. Armed with Vexs plans and an ancient prophecy, Sackboy must rise to put down Vexs plot. As Sackboy, youll travel across five unique worlds and meet a colorful cast of side characters. The plot is relatively simple and filled with cliches, but it works well. Rather than going for shock and awe, the story manages to capture attention thanks to its charming characters, visuals, and voice performances. This is particularly true of Vex. Richard E Grant deliciously chews up every scene Vex is in and its simply fantastic to watch how it all unfolds. The story is magnetic even if its filled to the brim with classic cliches. In many ways, it just adds to the games character.The game manages to keep up a high level of charm throughout the campaign. In total, youre looking at around 8-10 hours just running through the campaign. During that time, youll visit five distinct worlds in Sackboys quest to defeat Vex. Within each of those worlds are an assortment of different levels, shops, co-op missions and challenges to run through. To progress between each world, youll need to collect blue Dreamer Orbs. These blue-tinted orbs are hidden throughout the levels and are required to face off against the worlds final boss. Playing through these levels in search of Dreamer Orbs isnt that much of a chore when nearly every level is fun and engaging. Sumo Digital has done a solid job distilling the charm of LittleBigPlanet into its own platforming game. The amount of imagination on display is mesmerizing, giving players various scenarios to play through. Youll go on a deep-sea treasure hunt, survive a wild train ride, save baby monkeys from a monsoon and do so much more throughout Sackboys journey. Perhaps the most inventive levels are the ones that deeply ingrain music into their core. These levels use actual music to dictate the levels flow, timing enemy movement, background scenery, bounce pads and more to the beat. Who knew it would be such a blast to play through an entire level set to Uptown Funk.Sackboy: A Big Adventure sheds the LittleBigPlanet franchises creation tools to deliver a pure platforming experience. You can still heavily customize your Sackboy, but you wont be creating any new levels. This also means shedding the 2.5D platforming of the original series in favor of an entirely 3D experience. This has allowed Sumo Digital to address two of LittleBigPlanets most significant issues; the finicky switching between three different planes and the floaty platforming. The result is a platformer that plays far more precisely than any previous LittleBigPlanet game.Sackboy isnt a difficult game to play through, but the game does throw enough obstacles and tools into the mix to keep platforming entertaining. Levels are designed around different tools and mechanics that open different gameplay opportunities. The grappling hook helps you get over edges but can also be used to grab out-of-reach objects or combined with jump pads to get over a too tall ledge. Hover boots not only get you across long distances but also include gloves that fire lasers, giving Sackboy a ranged way to deal with enemies. Orange Gloop allows you to walk on walls or the roofs, but you lose the ability to jump. Theres a lot of fun stuff to uncover, but, unfortunately, its all level specific. You wont be able to mix and match different items across different levels. Meanwhile, for those wanting more difficulty, there are lots of time trials to participate in thatll test your skills.Sackboy: A Big Adventure can be played solo, but its clear Sumo Digital intended the game to be played co-op. All of the levels are designed to be large enough to accommodate up to four players and many of them even have items that can only be collected with extra people (at least if you dont force a death and respawn at the checkpoint). Even more evidence of this is that there are specific missions that can only be played through co-op. Playing the game with friends and family is fun, but the game makes it a pain by only including couch co-op. At the 11th hour, Sumo Digital announced that online co-op would be delayed to sometime later this year. Its a significant oversight, particularly given the ongoing pandemic.Sackboy: A Big Adventures gameplay is a vast improvement over LittleBigPlanet. The transition to 3D is a successful venture that still manages to keep all the original franchises charm. There are more tools to play around with, more challenges to engage with and dozens of levels to platform through. Its just unfortunate that a critical aspect of the experience, co-op, was hampered by a delay.Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a launch title for PS5, and as such, youd expect it to be a showcase for the new hardware. Thankfully, Sumo Digital has delivered a visually-stunning game that runs smoothly throughout. The textures are vibrant and beautifully detailed, Sackboys fabric has never looked so real and the art style looks so clean when playing on PS5. Thats not to say that the PS4 version doesnt look bad. The game still looks and runs beautifully on Sonys current-gen machine, but if you have a PS5, this is the version to get.The PS5 version also benefits heavily from its SSD technology and DualSense. Load times are noticeable since the game uses them, but theyre typically gone in just a few seconds. Its a lot easier to get in and enjoy the game on PS5 versus PS4. The DualSense also does a good job immersing players into Sackboys world. You can feel the tension as Sackboy grabs and pulls objects, feel his feet leaving a bouncing pad and even a train going off the tracks. Its an impressive use of the technology.Rounding out the performance is the stellar audio. Though Sackboy may be silent, the world around him isnt. All the characters are injected with plenty of charm thanks to the superb voice cast. The licensed tracks that populate certain levels are integrated well and you cant help but hum along to the beat. Finally, just the base levels themselves are populated by great music. Altogether, the visuals, technology and audio create a fantastic presentation.Closing CommentsSackboys legacy was always tied to LittleBigPlanet and its creation tools. Media Molecule no doubt created a PlayStation icon, but he always played second fiddle to the tools. That perception is no more thanks to Sackboy: A Big Adventure. Sumo Digital has successfully excised Sackboy from the creation tools and given him his own platforming game. The game is gushing with character and charm thanks to its wide array of imaginative levels. The transition to 3D platforming has allowed for more precise and varied gameplay, providing a solid level of fun for players of all ages. As a PS5 launch title, the game delivers a colorful and detailed presentation, though it remains no slouch on PS4. The story isnt anything special and chocked to the brim with cliches, but a solid voice cast combined with great level design will keep you playing the entire length. While playable solo, Sackboy is best when played co-op, and unfortunately at launch, co-op options are limited. As a complete experience, though, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a fun platforming adventure thatll leave you with a smile on your face.", "date": "November 12, 2020", "grade": 4.0}
