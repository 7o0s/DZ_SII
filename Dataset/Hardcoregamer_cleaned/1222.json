{"name": "Reverse x Reverse", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=186545", "text": "It says a lot about the number of indie games that I pay attention to when an idea that once seemed completely unique basically ends up becoming its own subgenre or type of game. In this case, puzzle-platformers where you have to alternate between and/or control two characters at once. Games such as Ibb and Obb or Circa Infinity, to name two examples off of the top of my head, have been working with that kind of scenario for quite a while now. So with that knowledge, does desunoyas latest game Reverse x Reverse bring anything new to the table in that area?Reverse x Reverse kicks things off with our protagonists, Code and Rithm, having a picnic in their game world. But when bug fields start to break out, its up to them to head into the inner layers of the game to debug things and save the day in the process. As it turns out, though, this the very definition of an Excuse Plot. The bits with any shreds of story only appear in between worlds, and even then theyre incredibly brief. Its kind of a shame that the game doesnt do enough with the whole meta-game angle, because there definitely exists the potential for some clever writing here. The main characters can be particularly charming, but they dont get a lot of room to shine personality-wise, instead limited to simultaneously navigating various obstacle courses in their games programming. Doing so requires each of them to use their unique talents  Rithms double jump and Codes dash maneuver  as well as the ability to join together and move in tandem. As you can tell by the screenshots, the two are typically dealing with their own flip side of gravity or their own unique path, opening up some possibilities.The level design is decently done for the most part, containing a variety of increasing obstacles including several kinds of moving platforms, blocks that trigger automatic scrolling, switches that cause Code and Rithm to swap places and change their gravity, and much more. The majority of the levels are well-designed, if a bit over-reliant on trial-and-error gameplay. It can be too easy to grab a disc that clears a bug field obstacle blocking your way, only to discover that you accidentally missed a step seconds prior, or that you needed that cache in play until later. Levels are only designed to last five minutes at most, but they still fall victim to those annoying moments where you die just inches away from the goal, forcing you to start everything over. Expect death to happen quite a lot, by the way.But again, the level design is still okay on a gameplay level. The visual design, a bit less. I know it sounds odd to say this about an indie game, but it almost looks a bit amateurish, from the clunky pop-up tutorial boxes to the monochrome platforms with no highlights and the cluttered backgrounds. I wouldnt even say that any of it is bad on its own, just that it blends together oddly. The cutesy anime character and enemy designs are supposed to come of as a contrast to the inner workings of the game worlds programming, but they honestly kind of come off as an afterthought if anything else. The music fares better, with some nice, chilled electronic tunes, albeit brief ones to fit the short length of each stage.So Reverse x Reverse, while not particularly outstanding, does indeed at least have the makings of an okay, competent puzzle-platformer. Unfortunately, it just happened to be saddled with a default control scheme from hell. Let me put it this way: When I have to spend at least a minute attempting to figure out which button actually starts the game, I take that as particularly bad omen.For a game that requires precision timing and quick thinking in a lot of places, the fact that it decided to go with a Z/X/C/V keyboard layout for the four main functions of the characters in a game like this baffles me. And you would think that an Xbox 360 controller (or any gamepad) would improve things, but for some reason it has the join ability mapped to the X button, A for the current characters special ability, and B to jump, of all things (not to mention LB to pause). A setup like that means that the moments where I had to control two characters at the same time while jumping turned into a frustrating chore.And I know some of you are thinking Well, why didnt you just reconfigure the controls? I did indeed reconfigure them later, but all I could still think of was Did the developers intend for their game to be played that way? What person thought those controls were a good idea? I should not have to fumble about the menu simply to correct a glaring flaw on the developers part, especially when it relates to the core gameplay. And even with the 360 controller, there were still some moments where the jumping felt rather awkward, especially during moments where I had to control both characters at once, jump, and use both of their abilities at the same time.Closing Comments:I really was hoping that Reverse x Reverse would turn out to be more than a merely average puzzle-platformer, but alas, it was not to be. Good level design and challenging gameplay sadly end up getting hindered by cheap shots, questionable controls and an underdeveloped premise. Code and Rithm may have been sent out on a quest to fix their games technical issues, but its a shame there was no one around to make sure the rest of it was as up to shape as possible as well.", "date": "January 13, 2016", "grade": 2.5}
