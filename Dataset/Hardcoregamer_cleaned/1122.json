{"name": "Upwards, Lonely Robot", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=196241", "text": "Sometimes its nice to ease back and just simply enjoy a game. A game that isnt fancy or complex. Something that doesnt have myriad systems to memorize, combos to master or hour long cutscenes. It just needs to be good. Random Layers Upwards, Lonely Robot manages to fit that bill quite well. Its not here to revolutionize the games industry. Its not asking players to sextuple wield weapons to take on the hordes of Nystagmous, Evil Overlord of Really Shiny Graphics. Instead it presents the player with a tower and a robot, using the title of the game for the rest of the instructions.This is how the game really stands out. This title casts the player as a lone robot tasked with platforming up the outside of seventy-five increasingly challenging towers. The robot is fruit powered, and its energy bar is always ticking down. So, picking up fruit and avoiding a variety of opposing mechanical enemies, the player must jump and dodge to the summit, using only a directional pad and jump button.That isnt to say that there is no story. The reason for these towers, the opposing robots, and even the existence of the vitamin C powered titular robot is slowly doled out after completing each level. These audio logs are told through the point of view of Matt, a scientist trapped in one of towers. While the story telling method might be a trope thats a little long in the tooth, it still manages to remain effective here. The commentary as to the whys and hows the different obstacles and challenges came to be is entertaining. The actual story justifications are intriguing. Still, the story is meant to be maudlin and sad, but it can come across as so over the top as to become humorous. Even money says that someone writing up the story has a puppy named Meloncollie. The climbing of the towers plays out in a 2.5D style. Each tower is cylindrical and it seems that the hero is magnetically stuck to the side of it as it climbs. Thus, the tower spins as the player moves from side to side. The effect is actually pretty cool, but is the only true graphical stand out here. The enemy robots themselves could have done with a touch more personality. Based on small insects and pests, like wasps and snails, they are colorful but not eye catching. They serve their purpose, at least. Fortunately, the hero bot does have some charm built in. The easiest way to describe the little booger is Wall-E in a hamster ball. Though the camera is zoomed pretty far out, it (he?) does have some cute little expressions on its face.The sound works to fill the charisma void. Each bot has a telltale sound to inform the player that they are around. The metallic clangs and clanks and the buzzing was recorded and added in a crystal clear fashion. Even on the cheap speakers that came with my PC, these sounded pretty nice. The soundtrack fares even better. Though there arent many tracks, the songs are rousing and fitting. Its orchestral sounding pumping through a rock artery, done via synths. Some may grow weary of the fruit guzzlers tones. The screeching whenever he picks up an apple or gets hit can become grating. The biggest issue can come from the controls. The game is generous with the jump physics due to the spinning of the tower. Should the player be on track to overshoot the platform, they can just press down to instantly stop forward momentum. This works great. The issue lies in the hardware that the player might choose. Using a controller with a rocker cross pad, like the one on a first party Xbox 360 controller, means unwanted uses of this feature. Using the keyboard or a controller with a proper pad resolves this issue handily, but it is something to keep in mind.There are a couple of other modes to add longevity to this title. A local or online race mode allows players to pit their skills against someone else to see who is the best. There is also an endless mode that lets players shoot for high scores, topping the leaderboard. These arent meant to be throw away modes and the versus can be quite fun. Considering the pick up and play mechanics of this one, tournament parties and drinking games could easily be built around this. Closing Comments:Built for simplicity and entertainment, Upwards, Lonely Robot is a worthy title. With a budget price and a boatload of levels and modes to conquer, the buck to bang ratio is in the audiences favor. Assuming, that is, that they have a hankering for a simple, but tough platformer. Though it has some flaws, this is an extremely enjoyable time. Even my wife enjoyed it, someone who tends to only play the mascot platformers like Yoshis Woolly World. Therefore, Upwards, Lonely Robot is gamer tested, wife approved.", "date": "Bohn on March 7, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
