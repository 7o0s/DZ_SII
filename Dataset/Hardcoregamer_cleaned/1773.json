{"name": "Grand Theft Auto V (PS4)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=117718", "text": "Its hard to believe there was a world without Grand Theft Auto V. Released in September 2013, GTAV broke practically every sales record and was lauded in almost every circle. While it debuted just months before the next generations of consoles, it didnt seem long in the tooth. Rockstar pushed the limits of nearly decade old hardware and delivered the largest entry in the series yet, both by size and sheer things to do. GTAV is a game where a hundred hours could easily be dropped into it without completing a single mission. Forever changing the landscape of video games, theres little doubt GTAV will go down as a classic. Rockstar, however, wants to preserve it in the best light so has decided to re-release the game on current-gen consoles in 1080p. Not content to release a simple port, though, Rockstar has changed the perspective we view the game  literally.The world of Grand Theft Auto V is so big that it requires three characters to explore it. While that line may sound ripped straight from a PR-laden interview, its quite accurate considering telling a story from the eyes of just one man would lead to new areas not being discovered for tens of hours into the game. The game stars three protagonists: Michael, Franklin and Trevor. After a prologue that sets the events of the game in motion, Franklin is the first playable character. Similar to CJ in San Andreas, Franklin is well-meaning gangster who lives with his aunt in the ghetto and is trying to make a better life for himself. Clearly more intelligent than his known associates, Franklin is confined to being a repo man for a shady car dealer who plays the race car to get customers into vehicles they cant afford, only to have Franklin repo them weeks later thanks to ludicrous financing. After one of the customers father, Michael, gets a whiff of this little scam, he comes down to pay the dealer a little visit. Impressed by his attitude, Franklin decides to reach out to Michael to see if they could work together.A former two-bit criminal, Michael has retired into a witness protection program. Thanks to his previous life, hes absolutely loaded and lives in a mansion with two kids and a wife. His kids are spoiled brats, with the son spending all day smoking pot and playing video games (no offensive, readers) and the daughter a fame-obsessed promiscuous teenager who will do anything to become a celebrity. His wife, on the other hand, resents him even though he gives her anything she could possibly want (including some surgical enhancements) and is having an affair with likely multiple suitors. Depressed and not challenged in his current country club life, Michael decides to team with Franklin for some excitement. Unfortunately, coming out of retirement made former partner and current psychopath, Trevor, take notice. After Michael went into retirement, Trevor relocated to Sandy Shores and decided to do what he does best  be a redneck. He lives in a trailer, has terrible hygiene, is promiscuous with all the wrong people and associates withlets just say the the wrong crowd. Even though he has delusions of grandeur thanks to his shell company Trevor Phillips Industries, hes a broke loser with little to show in life. After finding out that former accomplice Michael is alive and well under a different name, he decides to drive down to Los Santos to pay him a visit. Soon all three characters are thrust into the plans of a crooked FiB agent (guess what initialism thats a play on) and some notorious gangsters in the city and have to work together to survive and bring in a handsome payday while theyre at it.The first game in the series to offer more than one protagonist, things play a bit differently than before. As each character is introduced, youll play only as them for a few hours to get acquainted with their backstory and style of play. After all three characters are firmly established (about ten hours in), however, the rest of the narrative shifts between them. Theres missions unique to each character, some of which focus solely on their story (like Michael keeping his awful family at bay) and others that combine all three characters together. One mission, for instance, has Trevor flying a helicopter, Michael repelling from it and scaling a building and Franklin providing cover via a sniper rifle from a neighboring building. While some parts of the mission must be done as a certain character (like Michael repelling), others let you play as you want to. For instance, after fleeing, you can choose to either pilot the helicopter, shoot from inside or provide cover from a building with a sniper rifle. This swap happens on the fly via holding down on the d-pad, which allows any one of the three of the characters to be chosen. You can complete these mission parts as just one of the characters, but its generally best to cycle between all three to be most efficient. In-between missions, characters can almost always be swapped to at will by the same d-pad method. This is effective for both doing individual missions and covering different parts of the city. As the characters safehouses are generally spread apart, its a nice feature as the character closest to the desired destination can instantly be swapped to, saving commuting time. Another benefit to the multi-protagonist setup and also one of the biggest new features to mission portion of the game are heists. While the majority of missions are either driven by a single character or are like the aforementioned one, theres a handful of heists sprinkled throughout. Heists are basically multi-tiered missions that contain multiple small missions to set them up and require an higher level of planning to correctly execute. The first heist in the game, for instance, concerns knocking off a high-end jewelry store. There are two methods available to tackle the job: quiet or loud (smart or dumb). Going in loud is what youd imagine, simply rushing into the store with heavy artillery and running out with the merchandise. Going in quiet, however, requires more planning and stealth tactics. In a jewel heist, for instance, chemicals and an exterminator truck must be stolen. Using the exterminator gig as cover, you head up on the roof with a gas mask and uniform and drop some gas into the vents of the store. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew bursts into the store with similar outfits and cleans it out while the customers and clerks are unconscious. One great feature of these heists is that the crew itself must be individually selected. Youll generally need a gunner, driver and hacker, who are selected via a pool of known associates and characters encountered throughout missions. These criminals vary in expertise, with those highly experienced demanding more of the cut. Going with a low experienced crew member means that more could go wrong (for example, having a bad driver could mean they get captured and lose whatever loot they were carrying), but the more they are used, the better they get with the same cut. Heists add a fantastic dynamic to the game and make the scope of the universe seem larger than ever.Combat itself has been overhauled in GTAV. Instead of blindly cycling through weapons, theres now a weapons wheel that is brought up by holding the left bumper, allowing available weapons to be seen and selected easier. Additionally, getting busted or killed no longer forfeits your weapons, which makes spending money on weapons upgrades much more realistic. Actual combat is more customizable, allowing players to choose how much they want to be assisted with automatic locking. By default, its a bit of a mix between free-aim and full-lock, with targets in clear view automatically locked on and those hidden or at weird angles left to free-aiming. The cover system has also been improved, allowing smoother transitions. On the driving side of things, vehicle handling has been updated, with vehicles feeling better than ever before. While this is still the sort of game that lets you bounce around after landing a jump, handling feels more realistic and tailored to specific vehicles, instead of cars simply being fast or slow. Even supercars feel distinct from one another. Realism has also been visually improved, with cars mirroring their real-life counterparts like never before. Its clear whats a Mustang or whats an Audi and even though the brands cant be used, its better than simply looking for a fast car. The most notable addition to current-gen GTAV is the all-new first-person mode. For the first time ever, players can now choose to experience a Grand Theft Auto from the eyes of the protagonist (or in this case protagonists). Instead of being a mere gimmick, Rockstar made multiple changes to accommodate the new perspective including a first person cover system, a new control scheme, a different targeting system and thousands of new animations. As its hard to create a first-person experience that caters to everybodys preferences, multiple optional settings have been added including the ability to change control schemes, alter ragdoll perspectives and rolls and even turn off head bobbing. I wasnt a fan of how the game controlled in first-person by default, but was easily able to tweak it to a point where it felt like a standard FPS. Turning up the sensitivity and any auto-locking off is key to this. Commendably, Rockstar has even allowed the option to mix and match when first-person comes into play, permitting players to drive in first-person and shoot in first-person and vice versa. Allowing the former is a huge addition as it allows those who dislike first-person driving to still experience combat in first-person without having to continually swap modes or commit to one.Of course, the biggest question on manys mind is whether or not this is a mere gimmick. With the amount of work and customization Rockstar clearly put into it, its far from a throwaway feature. Those who tailor the settings to their likings will realistically find a whole new way to experience the title. Some may even prefer many aspects of first-person mode. While I found it agreeable, I still prefer to experience the entire game in third-person, but theres no denying that gunplay can be more smooth and precise in first-person. However gamers decide to experience it, though, they can be assured it will be in a beautiful setting. The world of GTAV is the biggest ever. Although the majority of it is rural, know that its not that theyve taken away from the city, but simply added hundreds of miles of land outside it just for good fun. The city itself is huge and rivals the entire world of GTA IV. Outside of it, theres mountains, rivers, beaches, desert and more. Surprisingly, however, hardly any of it is empty. Theres small towns, unique buildings, military bases and more sprinkled throughout. The incredible thing is how alive it all seems. Off one of the back roads, for instance, I noticed a car pull over at a fruit stand and decided to see if it was a coincidence, but nope  a woman got out, walked up to it and examined the produce. Thats level of detail to expect in the world, from the boardwalks with interactive rides to trains carving through mountain passes. To add some spice for players who like to drive around exploring the world, random events have been added that unfold during a day. Represented by a flashing blue blip on the map that appears when nearby, these range from a thief snatching a purse to a carjacking. After stopping the miscreant in one of these robberies, you can either keep the stolen item for yourself or return it to the victim. Doing the latter results in good karma that might just come back to you later in the game.For the current-gen re-release of GTAV, the resolution has been improved to 1080p at 30fps. The draw distance, level of detail and texture resolution have also all been increased. While the draw distance is still not perfect, its a lot better than it was last-gen, with most objects coming into view when youd actually be looking for them. The characters themselves look fantastic, with more facial detail and facial animations as well as higher resolution textures across their wardrobes. Theres more pedestrians on the streets, making the world feel more alive. Even the animals have softer fur and theres more species to boot. If softer animal fur wasnt enough to get you excited, all of the TV shows and short films in the game have even been rendered in high-resolution. GTAV was always a great looking game, but Rockstar has done a great job bringing it into this generation and making the world all the more beautiful. Of course, one of the aspects this series is most renowned for is its music. Vice City sparked a minor resurgence in New Wave, while Grand Theft Auto IV perfectly captured the burgeoning indie scene in Brooklyn at the time. Building off of the presentation and quality of the latters soundtrack, V boasts one of the series best collections of music. For indie lovers, Radio Broker is replaced by Radio Mirror Park, which features tracks from Twin Shadow, Yeasayer, Health, Neon Indian, The Chain Gang of 1974 and more. The incredible thing is that all of the aforementioned artists are contributing new music to the game and the fact that theres so many critically revered artists with new music on one channel is astounding. For electronic lovers, theres Soulwax FM, named after and featuring many remixes from electronic band Soulwax. On the pop side of things, theres Non-Stop Pop FM which features an excellent blend between current top ten artists like Rhianna, lesser-known ones like Robyn and classic acts like Hall & Oats. Of course, theres something for everyone with other stations focusing on rap, country, classic rock and more. The amount of care put into curating this soundtrack that could have simply been a collection of random songs is more evidence of how much work goes into even the smallest features of the game.As amazing as the soundtrack was last-gen, Rockstar shockingly decided to add even more songs to it in this re-release. A whopping 150 additional new tracks have been spread across the radio stations. Highlights include Holy Ghost!  Hold On, Hot Chip  Flutes, Neon Indian  Polish Girl, Lorde  Tennis Court, !!!  One Girl/One Boy and many, many more. If thats not enough, more DJ commentary has been recorded from some of the top DJs including DJ George (Twin Shadow), Nathan and Stephen (Wavves), Kenny Logins and more. On the talk radio side of things, Duane Earl (Danny McBride) has recorded new show segments. GTA has always been a series epitomized by its radio stations and by putting in the effort to expand GTAVs selections, not only have they made an already complete soundtrack more robust, but theyve made driving around a fresh experience Closing Comments:Rockstar has improved upon one of the greatest games of all time. The original version of Grand Theft Auto V was a major accomplishment upon its initial release and remains that way even after a year of the new console generation. The current-gen version, however, allows it to continue its legacy for many more years. Its worth diving back into Los Santos simply to experience the saga in smooth 1080p, but Rockstar has gone above and beyond by adding new features and content to it. More than just a gimmick, the first-person mode really does change how its experienced by adding a new layer of gameplay. It wont be for everybody, but the sheer fact that the option is there is commendable. More still, multiple new vehicles, weapons and animals have been introduced. If none of that were enough, over a hundred new songs have been added to the already robust radio stations. While theres nothing wrong with the last-gen version of Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar has created a museum piece with its remastered version. Everybody, from those who have spent the better part of the past year exploring everything its world has to offer to the three people who have yet to play it, should experience what has been put together here.", "date": "November 17, 2014", "grade": 5.0}
