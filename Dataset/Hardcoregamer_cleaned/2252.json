It might have been from a parent, a teacher, a friends grandfather, but the belief was always the same. You were simply trying to have fun and party, but the adults wanted to lock you down. They wanted your inner party animal to simmer down and stay quiet. It was something that all of us had to contend with back then because, well, we were kids. We wanted to have fun. Chainsawesome Games aim to revitalize that fresh and free ideal of the right to party. Following two young party rockers named Joey and Gina, the studios new game BeatBlasters III aims to keep the excitement of dance and rhythm alive, even when a disgruntled butcher wants it out of town. But like that easily infuriated adult, BeatBlasters III is a limiter. It pushes that sense of fun and freedom away. BeatBlasters III has an awesome mechanic with its use of rhythm and beat in gameplay, but the game built around that mechanic is a terribly tedious ordeal that never channels the games exciting internal energy.BeatBlasters III, as expected, focuses much of its innovation on rhythm and beat. The main gameplay element is using a metronomic beat to charge energy, which is used on the three central abilities: blaster, shield and rocket shoes. Blaster is your basic projectile attack, shield defends from incoming fire and can move certain objects, and rocket shoes let you fly upward to reach higher ground. Each power uses a single face button and has its own energy meter, which depletes as an individual power is used over time. Recharging the energy involves pressing and holding a shoulder button on the controller, then pressing the powers respective button in time with the metronome. Successfully timed recharging also fills another gauge, which when full, allows for infinite energy of all powers for a limited amount of time, while also shooting off a tremendous amount of blaster projectiles to take out enemies. This gameplay style, despite some convoluted elements when using multiple skills, is actually rather fluid. Being able to recharge your energy while walking on the ground keeps you busy, so you dont feel like getting around the stage is just dead air. Its surprisingly dynamic and mixes well with the beat-centric identity of the game.However, this feature is a completely wasted effort, because the game builds a terrible design around that mechanic. Many of the missions require some sort of protection or escort of another character. Protect a gorilla and his car from bomb-throwing monkeys, defend aliens while a robot repairs their crafts, all of these missions possess tedious and frustrating objectives that require you to babysit other characters to complete them. To make matters worse, the defendees are usually very slow, and I mean that in the most literal sense. These are the slowest escort missions Ive ever had the displeasure of enduring. Aside from the slow-as-mud gorilla car and sluggish elders walking in traffic to a casino, the games worst offender is a mission where you need to escort a horse across a bandit-camped wild west town. While you are forced to drain energy to defend the horse from bomb-tossing bandits, the horse is slow. Very slow. Even worse is when it stop dead in its tracks from a barrier you need to destroy, all while blocking off the bandits attacks. The terribly slow pacing also makes the different stages extremely tedious; they seem much longer than they actually are. While there are some nice exceptions like powering a yetis electric appliances, a vast majority of the missions in BeatBlasters III suffer from long, tedious escort missions that limit the upbeat rhythm-based gameplay to a downright monotonous pace.Completing a stage nets the heroes stars. Depending on how much damage your escorts take during the mission, you can get between one and three stars. Stars can be used to upgrade powers, but very rarely will you find a stage that requires one upgrade over another. While the early stages are actually pretty easy when you know what youre doing, some stages are downright impossible to get a perfect three stars on. This, once again, is derived from the sluggish pace of the escort missions, where youll literally feel exhausted from avoiding bombs and explosive potions. You can get up to 96 stars in the game, but there are only 16 levels, with 48 stars per character. The replay value in BeatBlasters III is extremely low; simply getting to the final boss can take as little as a single hour, and at $10 US, its just not a good enough price for the amount of tedium youre required to endure.These problems are huge disappointments, because the presentation is actually really good. The goofy, exaggerated cartoon designs are oddly reminiscent of Plants Vs. Zombies and the different characters are quite detailed. The animations do tend to look a little weird (Joey and Ginas jumping animations are especially wonky), but the charismatic expressions of each character are enticing and entertaining. The music is a big hit, with lots of different moods across the electronic circuit. Hearing a light keyboard twinkle while charging your energy in one level and a rougher dubstep drop in another offers variety. The games soundtrack is modern electronica from start to finish, but its great amount of aesthetic variety is a nice surprise for the game.Closing Comments:BeatBlasters III has a smart use of rhythm in its core gameplay. The balance of beat between three powers and a metronomic pace-keeper are strong and keep gameplay dynamic. Unfortunately, the design is a nosedive from square one. There are far too few exciting uses of the powers and far too many tedious trudges through escort mission territory. Theres not a single mission in BeatBlasters III that the offers idealized freedom and exciting party-time rush that electronic music channels. BeatBlasters III encourages excitement and the party vibe with its aesthetic, but its design does nothing but slog around obnoxious escorts and defense missions that instantly overstay their welcome.", "date": "on February 26, 2014", "grade": 2.0}
