Since then, it seems folks almost forgot about the game before its launch this month. Thankfully, as the critical reception has been all but glowing, gamers have regained interest. While first impressions are made off its gorgeous visuals, players will be happy to know that more goes on underneath that beautiful exterior. It boasts Metroidvania style gameplay along with increasingly unrelenting platforming segments at its core, but unlike so many 2D platformers focused purely on style, theres a serious amount of substance for Ori and the Blind Forest players to discover.Although theres much more to Ori than its visuals, theyre the first thing everyone sees  and cant take their eyes off. Yes, Ori and the Blind Forest is easily on of the most charming, radiant games out there today as far as graphics are concerned. It has the skillful artistry of a Studio Ghibli film alongside an incredibly crisp 1080p resolution. Every tree rustle reveals subtle leaf movement, and heck, every hand-painted backdrop looks just as incredible as the next. Theres so much detail in each that its hard not to stop and stare a while before proceeding along. Characters themselves, such as our tiny protagonist named Ori, are animated with the utmost care. It seriously looks as though the game is more animated film than something players actually control.In many ways, the bewitching visuals actually might confuse players as to how the game will proceed. Were treated to a lovely bit of wordless storytelling during the twenty or so minute introduction. Its surprisingly emotional and gameplay is quite sparse  simply walk left or right a little and make some basic jumps. Despite the cinematic feel and family-friendly image of Ori and company, however, this is an incredibly difficult game. Folks expecting the similar low impact gaming of some other visual powerhouse platformers will be in for a rude awakening. Gameplay does start out fairly easy but quickly escalates in difficulty, requiring players to do frighteningly specific (and sometimes frustrating) platforming moves. A few action sequences in particular are reviled by otherwise devout fans.Cute, cuddly Ori begins as a real weakling. Equipped with only a single jump and lock-on attack which can only hit one enemy at a time, theres little creativity for players to employ. Its not long, however, before the game includes players with new skills. The storyline is always pushing players to complete the next task  which sometimes bestows an awesome skill. As is expected with the Metroidvania genre, though, youll always want to check other areas and discover something new.Many areas which are blocked off early on can be returned to with a better skillset.Then there is the leveling system which allows players to modify Ori along three distinct paths. One is focused on increasing power of attacks, for example, while another focuses on passive abilities. Every item on this progression chart is shown from the start meaning you can and should start planning early for what skills fit best for your playstyle.Ori and the Blind Forests difficulty is not simply related to challenging platforming or enemies; one must even contend with its save system. You see, the game isnt keen on auto saving. Instead, in most instances you must instigate saves yourself utilizing energy. Energy is gathered through breaking crystals and defeating enemies, though sometimes youll find yourself without any energy to save at all. Some of Oris skills are tied to this same energy resource, meaning theres a risk/reward system to determining when you should expend energy instead of saving. Get accustomed to saving regularly as otherwise youll be in for a painfully frustrating journey.Demanding games require precise control schemes. In most instances, it feels Ori and the Blind Forest gets this right, but every so often Ori feels sluggish. It may be due to the creatures momentum, but there were multiple times when it seemed unable to grasp walls or jump as intended. On other occasions, it simply wouldnt stop grabbing walls when I needed Ori to hurriedly go elsewhere. Thankfully, as the furball powers up further new skills allow players to overcome sometimes spotty controls. A triple jump, for example, proves a savior in otherwise dangerous circumstances.Closing Comments:Theres nothing quite as rewarding as a good Metroidvania and Ori and the Blind Forest proves itself to be classified as one. Giant, sprawling landscapes hide tons of goodies just waiting to be collected once youve gained some new skills. Gorgeous artwork makes retreading old territory far less monotonous as well. Its true that Ori could be a bit friendlier to control, but for the most part allows players to traipse around with the utmost grace. Its rare to see a game with stunning visuals and excellent gameplay, but Ori and the Blind Forest does exactly that. As long as youre prepared for a serious challenge, then this is one game not to miss.", "date": "March 13, 2015", "grade": 4.5}
