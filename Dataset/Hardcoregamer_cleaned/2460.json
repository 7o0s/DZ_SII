{"name": "Volgarr the Viking", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=55637", "text": "Hardcore gaming during the 90s harbored heavy and hardened difficulty for the few platform games that were released. The early running of Castlevania as well as GhostnGoblins sent a lot of controllers flying towards the wall, because although the developers locked down the look and feel of these titles, the unforgiving nature in the games difficulty sent players into rampageous frustration.Fast forward to todays generation and we still have these type of brain and game busters. Genre favorite Dark Souls may have a bit of competition, however, with Volgarr the Viking. With an aesthetic and gameplay resembling Golden Axe and Megaman respectively, Adult Swim Games and Crazy Viking Studios platformer is a title in which players can take on the role of a badass viking. Volgarr was chosen by Odin to fight against a nasty dwarf by the name of Fafnir, who has already run amok over Midgard by bringing nothing but peril and panic.Aside from that small little side story written in the games manual, however, the players main focus is to get Volgarr through all seven levels without dyinger, too much. Volgarr is the butt of all deaths in this extremely relentless game. Much like Sir Arthur, Volgarr is strongest when he traverses through these worlds and finds chests containing his shield, helmet and flaming sword, but one hit from even the easiest enemy and that helmet comes off. A second hit and you lose your shield. The third hit dramatically subdues Volgarrs body in an explosive dismemberment of every part of his body.To avoid witnessing the viking hero endure a painful death, players will need to utilize all of his neat and nifty skills, some of which take the form of double jumping, rolling, striking and throwing a spear. A few elements from other similar titles of this genre were taken to enhance Volgarrs attack, most notably the charge of power in his spear if players hold the up button long enough before throwing itan obvious little homage to Mega Man. Whats really cool about the spheres is that they can be used to hoist Volgarr towards taller platforms after being thrown into a walled area. His rolling ability can open the opportunity to sidestep enemies and strike them from behind while Volgarrs double jump will also allow for a swift sword strike against an enemy should they dare to attack after their leap.While all of these attributes certainly make for a great maneuvering, players will find that the ultimate blueprint for besting the game is by trial and error. Expect to play through a certain level over and over again before moving on to the next. Whether it be lizardmen, mutant fish or undead warriors, all of Volgarrs enemies vary by color, which indicate their difficulty and how hard theyll push back. Certain platform puzzles take more than a quick glance to figure your way through, another obstacle that players will have to muster up a strategy for. After more repeated runs, a sense of direction and survival is gained, so the learning curve isnt too deep to the point where its unplayable.Boss fights also act as a test of patience. Even within the form of giant cobras, sea monsters and skeleton magicians, the usual standard applies when facing them. Learning each and every move is a huge key, but bear in mind the unforgiving nature of Volgarr the Viking; losing a boss battle puts you back all the way at the start of the level. Just imagine being nearly three strikes away from victory and your hit box is exploited.To make the difficulty even more daunting, Volgarr the Viking has no save feature whatsoever. Powering down the game means youll lose all that progress youve accumulated, even before you have reached the final boss. Crazy Viking Studios might have thought that this would have been the icing on the cake, but it does ruin a bit of the experience. The game is already freakishly unfeasible, so it would have made better sense to give the player some satisfaction in, for example, reaching the third level of the game and taking a rest before moving on. Vikings-to-be are welcome to leave the game running in the background, but even this doesnt make sense.Closing Comments:", "date": "September 16, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
