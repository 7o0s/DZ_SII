{"name": "Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=146013", "text": "The world is running out of water. What was once a beautiful ocean has become known known as the Dusk Sea  a dry, sandy basin full of monsters and little else. With little water left to go around, Stellard stands as the last hope for many villages. According to stories, this city is absolutely filled with water. Thats why Shallistera, nicknamed Shallie, has left her home. Shallies hope is to facilitate an appeal in Stellard to obtain the much-needed resource to bring back to her people. Unfortunately, the Dusk Sea has caused much more destruction than outsiders realized. Even Stellard is running low on water. This is the setup to Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea, which paints an immediately dour picture on the state of this world, despite its bright anime visuals.Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea is the third title in the Dusk sub-series of Atelier games, after Atelier Ayesha: The Alchemist of Dusk and Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky. Shallie, the dutiful diplomat from a far-off village does not let the news from Stellard turn her away. Instead, she commits to researching for them in the expectation of receiving some water as compensation after her tasks are complete. This naive, ever-hopeful personality is quite sad in context of a dying world  but that makes you want to see it through to the conclusion. However, it is not just Shallies story. Theres another protagonist named Shallotte who is a regular to the city. Surprisingly enough, her nickname also happens to be Shallie! As fate would have it, after a few close misses, the two finally meet and befriend one another. Their goals are both to resolve whatever has been happening with the Dusk Sea, though theyve both got personal goals to work toward as well.As was also the case in Atelier Escha & Logy, players select which character theyd like to play as. Unlike that game, however, choosing either Shallie results in many divergent aspects. Yes, they do eventually come together, and the main storyline proceeds the same way, but there are still unique takes on different situations. After all, despite sharing the same nickname, both girls have distinct personalities.Those who enjoy their first playthrough of Atelier Shallie should definitely try again with the other character. With that said, Shallistera appears to offer an easier gameplay mode, while Shallotte provides a higher difficulty setting. Thats just how it feels, as the game never explicitly states that one character is normal while the other is hard difficulty.The biggest change in this game is the removal of a time system, which has been a long-standing feature until now. Without a time requirement, how are you shuttled through the game? Youre given life tasks which are displayed as thought bubbles inside your characters brain. Usually theyre pretty simple goals: Beat a certain type of monster, create a certain item, etc. Complete enough of these goals and youll be ready to move onto the next chapter. In fact, the game explicitly asks if youre ready to move on or not. Its a weird question, and one Im not used to games asking outright. After all, you can still stick around without proceeding but theres little reason to. Basically, if youve completed enough tasks to move forward that means youre strong enough to proceed.In any case, gameplay is split primarily between exploring levels and then alchemizing (or, crafting) items. Battles themselves feel dull and uninspired. Like a standard JRPG youve got a turn based system and a crew of characters with special attacks at the ready. Theres a burst mode which accumulates across battles and yields an extra power up, but for the most part youll fly through battles anyway.Theres not a ton of bosses to come across, either, which makes it all the more apparent that alchemy is the main focus. Players collect potential alchemy recipe goods on the field, from enemies and the like to bring back to a cauldron. Once there youre given a huge amount of options as to how you want to prepare an item. Switching items out for better versions yields more potent results, for example. Its a complex system, but one that youre given multiple tutorials for to help out.One stand out aspect of every Atelier game are the visuals. This is equally true in Atelier Shallie, but perhaps even a bit more. Although its a PS3 game, the character designs are treated with so much care they look better than practically any other title using an anime art style at the moment. The backdrops, on the other hand, suffer under PS3 limitations. Many look dull and uninspired, which is a shame considering how much the game has to offer. At times theres also slowdown which is something which (hopefully) wont occur once the series makes the move to PS4. On the other hand, its soundtrack is absolutely stellar. Songs are moody where required and exude a fantastic, distinct flair overall.The saddest thing about Atelier Shallie is not its storyline but the fact that this game was not given the attention it deserves in regards to localization and text editing. Not only was there a typo in the opening video, but typos and iffy writing in general appear at multiple instances throughout the game. Yes, this is PS3 JRPG very late in the systems lifespan, but that doesnt mean it can simply be pushed out without a few look overs first.Closing Comments:Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea brings with it not only a conclusion to the Dusk series, but a surprising amount of changes. Being free to explore as you wish relieves any pressure to compete against a clock. The dual-character narrative is also utilized to its fullest, making a game youll want to play twice. Some aspects and returning characters wont quite make sense for new players, but it honestly makes it seem worth circling back to Atelier Ayesha for me personally. The PS3 inhibits the game in a few ways, but for the most part Atelier Shallie still shines brightly. Fans of the series, as well as newcomers looking for a different style of JRPG owe it to themselves to try Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea.", "date": "April 25, 2015", "grade": 4.0}
