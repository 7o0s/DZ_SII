{"name": "The Walking Dead Season 2: Episode 5  No Going Back", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=100612", "text": "It has been one long, terrible road for little Clementine. Multiple horrific acts have taken place in front of the eleven-year old child, and with the world in the state as it is, things are only going to get worse. Seeing a man beaten to death or eaten alive by Walkers are deep emotional scars for anyone, but those pale in comparison to the inhuman that await friends. Amid the Ruins left players off with a shocking conclusion that no doubt would end in the demise of multiple characters. How things unfold is up to the player and their meaningful choices.The last episode left us off with such an incredible cliffhanger that had everyone gritting their teeth in anticipation. Unfortunately, the beginning of the No Going Back takes that anticipation and leaves us with utter disappointment. There was a setup for something absolutely phenomenal for the series, and yet Telltale somehow fumbles it into nothing more than an afterthought and wasted potential. Its not only the beginning of the episode but what follows, as there are some outlandish events with some of the characters to specifically remove them from the story  or at least for the time being. It almost feels artificial how these are set up, almost as if they were racing towards the finish. Thankfully, theres one event early on that bring us closer to some of the characters in a heartwarming experience. Its a rare occurrence to be found amongst the killing and running weve become accustomed to, finally sitting down with a group and feeling a little at ease. This coupled with a rather tender moment a little past halfway through, and it becomes an emotional episode.Another problem No Going Back has is the lack of adventure game elements. This is a series that originally contained somewhat strategic puzzle solving components, but it has become less and less prevalent over the last season. No Going Back has absolutely none of this and even restricts the player from moving outside of two instances  and even one of those is just Clementine tasked with walking twenty feet and opening a door. Theres no putting two and two together nor are there any obstacles to overcome. At some point, it makes you question why Telltale even has a system to move around when its absolutely trivial in the grand scheme. This is something past episodes suffered from but No Going Back takes it to another level. The only other control players have over little Clementine is the ability to choose different responses for her to say, but its only at the end that they become a significant factor. Dispatching of Walkers in combat scenarios are still here but theres not much strategy or urgency to them.As the conclusion of the second season, gamers are expecting big things, and thankfully Telltale has delivered. The final scenario is arguably one of the most gripping and incredibly uncomfortable moments weve seen from both seasons. Strangely enough, its able to capture both Clementines maturity as someone who can make drastic choices, and at the same time, her inability to offer aid or persuasion to adults in dire times. There are roughly five different conclusions to be found, and having seen them all, each one has their own strengths and weaknesses. Some are very emotional and bring out the best in Clementine, while others test her trust and willingness to accept others into her world after the recent horrific events. In the end, whether the eleven year old girl becomes a hardened loner or a faithful friend is entirely up to the player. Closing Comments:", "date": "August 26, 2014", "grade": 3.5}
