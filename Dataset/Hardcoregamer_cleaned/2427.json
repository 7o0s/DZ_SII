{"name": "The Stanley Parable", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=58895", "text": "This is a review about a game featuring a man named Stanley. He worked in an office in a menial job where he did pointless busywork, until one day everyone disappeared and a narrator started dictating his every move. Sometimes Stanley worked with the narrator to move the story forward, and sometimes he went off and did whatever he pleased while the narrator got increasingly frustrated. Every ending, no matter how strange, sad, uplifting, bitter, or inexplicable led to a new beginning, where Stanley would once again set out from his office in an endless back-and-forth struggle with the narrator for some measure of control. Stanley screwed with the narrator, the narrator screwed with Stanley, and on rare occasions theyd walk the path of the story together as a team. Stanleys life was very strange.The Stanley Parable is a study in freedom in gaming, in which the whole point is to test the limits of the narrative to see just how big the box youve got to play in actually is. Like an M.C. Escher woodcut its constantly trying to make you understand its illusions by playing with them in near-endless new ways. While Escher wanted the viewer to understand its all just flat lines on paper no matter how 3D it looks, The Stanley Parable is endless choices that only appear to give the player all sorts of fun ways to make the narrative fly off the rails.As artsy as the game may be when you think about it, The Stanley Parable still manages to be, most of all, a lot of fun to experience. Theres humor to be found from the very start as you snag the first achievement, and the game pokes fun at everything from story structure and narrative conventions to gaming tropes that are so ingrained you might not even notice them any more. The writing is smart and the narration is excellent, so much so that I usually found myself stopping any time the narrator had something to say just to make sure I didnt miss anything. The theme of freedom as presented in a medium that only offers the illusion of freedom may sound pretentious, but the presentation is anything but that.If theres one problem with The Stanley Parable its that its hard to talk about without spoiling. The game is a first-person narrative with limited interactivity, so the value of the experience is in discovery and experimentation. Its hard to be delighted about discovering the narrator got so annoyed with your screwing around that he boarded up a room so you couldnt go in there any more if someones already pointed you in the right direction. There are huge, deep mysteries and hidden side-stories to pursue in The Stanley Parable, a couple of which will probably require an FAQ to figure out, but the fun of the game is following the story down all its dozens of branching paths and seeing what new situation you end up in. Discovering the narrators reactions as he tries to get you back on the path, gets annoyed as you dont do what you should, gives up completely and just starts winging it, despairs, gets angry, or sometimes even kills you in frustration is also good fun, and is frequently a worthy reward for doing strange things.Closing Comments:", "date": "October 17, 2013", "grade": 4.5}
