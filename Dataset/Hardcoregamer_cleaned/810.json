{"name": "Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=229963", "text": "We can argue the merits of exclusivity deals, but theres no denying Rise of the Tomb Raider was a fantastic game when it debuted in 2015. Originally released on Xbox One and ported to PC early this year, Crystal Dynamic and Nixxes have been hard at work to ensure Lara Crofts biggest adventure yet would be in perfect condition when it made its way to PlayStation 4. Put together with the core campaign, all of the downloadable content released thus far and a couple of new modes, Rise of the Tomb Raider has never looked so appealing. Even though some of the DLC released over the past year has been less than stellar, the 20 Year Celebration will give fans exactly what theyre looking for.After the events in the Pacific Ocean, Lara Croft has been coping with her actions with more adventure. Having seen such supernatural elements that could transcend time, the young lady becomes determined to clear her fathers name who was denounced by the historian community when she was young. He became obsessed with the idea of immortality, specifically the Divine Source thats said to be located in the lost city of Kitezh in Siberia, and like father like daughter, Lara risks everything by going after this power. She isnt alone, though, as theres a rival organization under the name Trinity thats also looking for the same source of power, hoping to use it for their own good. The antagonists of the plot have far more depth than originally thought. They come off as power hungry individuals, but its revealed slowly that they do have more genuine reasoning for tracking this artifact down. Its nice to see a plot where the enemies arent entirely evil, especially if you listen to some of their journal entries, but at the same time, they are slaughtering hundreds of natives of the area and constantly trying to kill Lara. Most of the plot isnt even told through the cutscenes, though, as the logs left behind by Trinity, old Soviet workers, Greek philosophers and even Mongolian adventurers paint a better picture of what is and has happened in this ruined part of the world. They even go as far to identify the benefactor behind Trinity, which potentially opens up additional religious-tied adventures for Ms. Croft.The story itself is formulaic for an Indiana Jones-inspired adventure: protagonist goes after artifact, continuously crosses paths with an opposing faction, stumbles upon an ancient race, uncovers hidden secrets and so forth. It has been done over and over again, but what shines here is the protagonist. Lara Croft is very much coming into her own. In the previous installment, while a strong individual, she didnt really know how to deal with such dire situations and took a beating along the way. Here, she is much more capable in what she can do and how its accomplished. She can handle any situations without having to coach herself or stabilize her mental status. Even when she comes face to face with a giant grizzly bear shes, while I wont say shes completely composed, more agile and quick thinking about how to get around the obstacle.Mechanically speaking, those who have played the reboot will feel right at home with Rise. This isnt the overhaul the Tomb Raider series saw in 2013, but itd be too much to expect Crystal Dynamics to experiment too heavily with an already proven formula. The Developers have laid the groundwork for the series moving forward in order to adjust and add to their work, and it comes out well. The platforming mechanics can be a bit finicky at times, leading to more deaths than in combat, but its quite satisfying when a series of acrobatic moves are strung together, making you feel even grander than a female Indiana Jones. Lara doesnt have more tools at her disposal because she basically gets the same arsenal as before, but at least the upgrade paths are more diverse. There are pistols, assault rifles, shotguns and of course bows to equip to Lara with, along with her trusty ice axe that can be quite deadly in certain situations. We are now treated to a tiered upgrade path, requiring our heroine to obtain a certain equipment in order to enhance her weapons to the max. Its not just weaponry, though, as Lara Croft herself, as per usual, has a leveling system, allowing our ferocious heroine to be even more effective in combat and in her adventures. There are even multiple outfits to fit Lara with, not only allowing players to choose her fashion choice, but also adding boost in aspects such as health regeneration.Theres a stronger emphasis on stealth this time around, using the environment around Lara to get the edge on her opponents. So for example, in most encounters, at least outside of the guided and highly entertaining cinematic set pieces, enemies wont know theyre being hunted unless the player makes themselves known. There are trees to climb to avoid detection, shrubs to move through to silently incapacitate foes and various distractions to use to your advantage. Instead of knowing where you are immediately when engaging in combat, its all determined from an enemys perspective. If an arrow hits the head of one of their comrades theyre speaking to, they will see the direction in which it came from, whereas if his back is turned, he will only begin to investigate, maybe alert those around his immediate vicinity. Theres even a minimal detection meter that will pop up over enemy heads, but this feels a bit underutilized as its just a two state alert (curious and found) and rarely came into play. Its too bad there arent more chances to hide during combat, though, because most situations dont have an exit plan once youre spotted.The biggest enhancement to the formula, though, is the sheer scope of the world. This is something the 2013 reboot implemented and changed how we looked at the Tomb Raider franchise moving forward. It wasnt this linear, straightforward shooter, but a colossal game with a true emphasis on exploration, something thats needed in an Indiana Jones-esque adventure. In Rise of the Tomb Raider, the Siberian wilderness is far grander, having multiple layers to each environment and a vast collection of goodies to find. There are essentially three hub areas in the game, containing an overwhelming amount of extras to delve into, with the remaining sections of the map being more set pieces to the high octane combat scenarios. This opens up a lot of variety and flexibility for combat, now with the ability to craft items such as Molotovs, smoke bombs and grenades, not to mention potentially rigging enemy bodies with poison gas. Theres so much to do in Rise of the Tomb Raider, and while it only took us twenty hours to basically one-hundred percent the game (at least on the Normal Tomb Raider difficulty), it was well worth the effort.One of the biggest complaints with the last Tomb Raider was that it somewhat strayed away from what the series was known for: tomb raiding. That has been fixed with Rise of the Tomb Raider to a vast degree. There are far more tombs to raid this time around, usually visually drastic from one another and tie together various mechanics in a thought provoking manner. You will obtain not only a vast amount of gold, but various new abilities and enhancements to Lara. While a number of them can be a bit challenging, it would have been nice if there were multi-tiered tombs. All of them essentially take place in a single area, and after two or three puzzle solving actions, the tomb can be cleared. A number of them can be completed in under two minutes if youre smart enough, so lengthier and multi-layered tombs to explore would have been preferable. There are also crypts to raid, but they are straightforward underground graves that dont really offer up much of a challenge.While Crystal Dynamics worked on the core aspect of the reboot, Eidos Montreal created a multiplayer component that, while had its charm, was somewhat of a throwaway experience. For better or for worse, there is no multiplayer experience in Rise of the Tomb Raider. Instead, what has replaced this component is an Expenditures mode in which players are given various objectives to complete in the course of a tomb or mission, allowing them to post a higher score. These are mainly used to compete on the leaderboards, although it does unlock an in-game currency thats used to buy packs of cards that will have various effects in the mode itself. Its very similar to Halo 5s Requisition system, boosting gold acquisition or having the reverse effect but giving Lara more powerful weapons. There are even more comical cards to find, such as your bow shoots chickens instead of arrows, or big head mode. This in itself is not the core experience for what players will come to Rise of the Tomb Raider for. It offers up a decent challenge to compete against friends or people around the world, but its not something that will have a lasting effect. At least it sets up potential downloadable content in the form of new tombs.As for the PlayStation 4 release, there are a couple of solid additions, but nothing has changed in the main campaign. Firstly, the 20 Year Celebration comes with all of the downloadable content released since the PCs arrival; this includes the subpar Cold Darkness, the half decent, albeit short, Baba Yaga: The Temple of the Witch, the hardcore survivalist Endurance Mode. Theres a new mission in Expenditures called Blood Ties, and its probably the best content in the entire package mainly because of how different it is from everything else. While theres no killing or adventuring the vast wilderness, its actually building upon Lara Croft and her struggles with family, both in immediate and extended. Listening to all of the documents in the world and finding the various relics actually has some development around Lara, as opposed to some absurd fictional plot. Its a moody and surreal experience that I wish was originally in the main campaign. This also ties into Laras Nightmare, another addition to the 20 Year Celebration that takes place in the same setting. Here, our heroine is battling a nightmare revolving around her uncle and his means to strip the Croft Manor away from Lara. Its an OK addition, but it feels similar to Cold Darkness as Lara is simply running and gunning crazed, infected individuals while destroying floating masks. Its far less of a compelling mode but at least it has a fantastic eerie sound design.Closing Comments:After such a long wait, PlayStation 4 users finally get to experience Rise of the Tomb Raider in all its glory, and then some. While most of the downloadable content added to the experience since the PC versions arrival hasnt been fantastic, Blood Ties adds a much deserved look at Lara Crofts state of affairs within her family. While it was just an afterthought in past games, or even non-existent in some, it has been expanded up great to give players a better understanding of the Croft name, along with her mothers side of the tree. Laras Nightmare is a little disappointing, being a short experience that takes some of the worst elements of Cold Darkness and brings it to the Croft Manor, but theres still some classic unlockable skins that should please long running fans. Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration is a joyous occasion that properly commemorates the evolution of Lara Croft and her franchise.", "date": "October 10, 2016", "grade": 4.5}
