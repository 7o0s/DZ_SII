{"name": "Hatsune Miku: Project Diva X", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=222881", "text": "Hatsune Miku is both one of the only and one of the most famous digital pop stars out there. Since she first debuted in the mid 2000s, her fanbase has grown globally and led to all manner of concerts, strange partnerships with food companies and a large selection of video games. Given that Miku is a musical icon, it only makes sense that the Project Diva series is chock full of rhythm gaming goodness. This trend continues in the latest release of Hatsune Miku: Project Diva X on PS4 and PS Vita. However, there are a fair share of enhancements and tweaks to the classic formula. Some of these make the whole package more compelling, while others are no big deal. Whether youve played a Miku game before or not, theyre darn easy to get started with.In many ways, Hatsune Miku: Project Diva X is actually a great starting point for newbies to the Vocaloid world because it provides a simple storyline to get players involved. It all begins with the Vocaloid crew discovering they can no longer sing for some inexplicable reason. This causes reverberations in their world. Without their music making its way out to fans, they effectively have no fans, and no power. Its up to the player to bring Miku, Meiko, Kaito, and the rests cheerful voices back to them. The way to do this is simple: Kick butt at the rhythm gameplay. These story segments pop up between stages and basically look a lot like a visual novel. The only difference is that these story beats are super brief and serve best to give us amusing glimpses into the world of these digital singers rather than progressing a particularly interesting plot. Of course, one really shouldnt come in expecting an intense storytelling experience with Hatsune Miku and company. The focus is obviously on providing an engaging rhythm gaming experience for players of (most) skill levels. As far as this is concerned, theres not really any huge changes to gameplay. The simplest concepts set up in the original game are still at play here. You must hit PlayStation controller face buttons once they match up with on-screen indicators, which are conveniently timed to beats of the music. There are occasionally special buttons, such as ones requiring the player to hold the button for a set duration. Youll also find a new one known as Rush. When hit, the player must then rapidly tap the same face button until the visual prompt finally expires. Its a quick way to rack up extra points, as long as you actually nail hitting it. At first, it may seem that Hatsune Miku: Project Diva X is too easy in comparison to standards of the genre. On its lowest difficulty, youre stuck basically pressing a single button in time. The second difficulty setting (of two unlocked for the first portion of the game) fares better for genre veterans. There are more buttons to press, sometimes simultaneously, and they scroll across the screen in faster fashion overall. The biggest issue is that if you cant even best the lowest difficulty then you wont get very far. The quest mode requires players to beat a minimum score before they can move onto new songs and areas. If you cant at least get decent rankings on each song, well, you simply wont get very far. Theres also no mode to practice songs outside of a simple tutorial which plays fan favorite track Levan Polkka.There are thirty songs included in this package, although you are going to have to grind through the story mode in order to collect access to them all. There is certainly paid DLC to unlock more songs, but there are currently only two DLC tracks alongside the launch (Sharing the World and Hand in Hand). Thirty songs might not seem like much, but Hatsune Miku: Project Diva X brings a great deal of effort into keeping each song unique. Every song has its own dance routine as well as themed backdrop. Sure, you might not get to watch much while playing, but these bright, outlandish sequences are well done regardless. One other rather interesting change to the Project Diva formula is that costumes are no longer purchased in game. Instead, they get unlocked by performing well during Chance Time. There is just one Chance Time segment in every song, but acing it rewards players with a new Module (AKA costume). The only issue with this mechanism is that its completely random as to which outfit you receive. However, you could put on a Module with a skill that increases the odds of unlocking rare Modules. Therein lies a bit of a conundrum, however. You see, even though each Module has its own feature to help players out, the Quest mode focuses heavily on forcing players into certain outfits over others. This is because each area, and each Module/accessory, come with one specific style. Wearing clothes that match the style of the song reward players with percentage increases while simply wearing your favorite (incorrectly styled) dress doesnt do anything. Given there is little strategy to playing dress up, they probably should have left the Module-matching aspect as an optional feature. Luckily, its absolutely not important when you move onto other modes such as Festivals. A Festival is often curated by players themselves, meaning they can choose nearly whatever stage, characters, and costumes they desire. Its important to note that the Concert Editor, which effectively allows you to create your own music video, is DLC. Hey, at least its a free download!Closing Comments:Hatsune Miku games always excel thanks to their libraries of great musical tracks. The same is true in the latest release, though it would have been nice to see even more songs in the base package. Gameplay is easy enough for most to be able to succeed, but gating off tracks via a skill barrier is always unfortunate for the rhythmically-challenged among us. On the plus side, at least less grinding is required to snap up hot new costumes for your Vocaloid crew. In the end, what were left with is another enjoyable release in the Project Diva series even though this isnt the game that will convert everyday folks into Miku diehards. To do that, youd need a friendlier setup alongside a narrative thats actually at least a little compelling. You still cant knock Miku too much as her series of games always provides a fanciful, musical break from a stressful week.", "date": "August 26, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
