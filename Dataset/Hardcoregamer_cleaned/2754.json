{"name": "New Super Mario Brothers 2", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=11634", "text": "The New Super Mario Brothers series has kept the side-scrolling aspects of the series alive while fighting claims of stagnation. Now, the series makes its 3DS debut and feels even more like past games. Only instead of paying homage to classics from two decades before, weve got a game that feels like a retread of something from 2006  the original NSMB game. Thats not an altogether bad thing, but having a feeling of deja vu throughout the entirety of a game with NEW in its title isnt a good thing.While the games stages are different than past ones, it feels all too similar due to the lack of new themes. Youve got the grassy stage, ice, fire, underwater  if youve played any entry in the Super Mario or New Super Mario series, you know what to expect. The game controls as well as it has before, and really the only new thing is the emphasis on coins. Previously used to give you 1-Ups, which they still do, your coin count is now tracked and grants you extras like being able to save without having to beat a castle. As you progress through the stages, youll unlock Coin Rush versions of every level. In Coin Rush, youll go through three stages armed with a coin-granting golden fire flower, a strict time limit, and the knowledge that youll get an instant game over if you die. You not only need to beat the stages, but do so in an efficient and safe manner (unless you use the white tanooki suit that grants invincibility). It adds challenge and lets you rake up 1-Ups a bit faster than the main game, but doesnt feel like enough of a hook for the game.Super Mario 3D Land awarded you something special when you beat it  an entire second set of new levels to conquer, effectively giving you two games for the price of one. An argument can me made for coin rush trying to do that since it gives you an additional challenge for existing levels, but it really just shuffles the deck a bit. Its nice to have this feature be StreetPass-enabled, but having complete online leaderboards would have enhanced the satisfaction of a high score. Now, there are a couple of extra sets of stages to unlock and post-game star stages, but they arent as substantial as 3D Lands extra stages. While New SMB 2 disappoints when it comes to trying new things, it does the tried and true stuff very well. Mario controls just as well as he did in past NSMB games  pretty much perfectly. Youll run and jump exactly when you want to, and wont be able to blame your failures on the controls. Sadly, this sequel looks about the same as the other NSMBs. Similarly, the remixed music is exactly as good as it was before, because in many cases, the songs are the same. If you loved the soundtracks there, youll love them here and can save on battery life by just humming the tunes instead of turning up the volume.The game as a whole doesnt make great use of the system outside of Street Pass for coin rush and the graphics. 3D is there, but it winds up making things more blurry than adding depth, and unlike 3D Land, doesnt make use of the camera feature at all. Without taking advantage of the 3DS capabilities, the game ends up feeling like something that couldve been on the DS as an expansion pack to the original game.Closing Comments:", "date": "August 24, 2012", "grade": 3.5}
