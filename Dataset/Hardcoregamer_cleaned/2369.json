{"name": "Just Dance 2014 (Xbox One)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=63462", "text": "Confession: Just Dance 2014 was the first Xbox One game I played. While I might claim the reason to be my journalistic duty, Ill let you in on a little secret: it was because I knew it was the one launch title Id instantly have fun with. Dont pass that around and if you see anybody on Just Dance TV resembling me, I can totally assure you it isnt, but I cant deny that this is a blast. Its like a party in a box, doesnt make you feel like youre not worthy of it and has enough great music to get you off the couch dancing for hours on end. So while, yes, I will sigh and complain about my job if you ever walk in on me playing it, know that even for a professional male journalist, its hard not to have fun with Just Dance.As always, Just Dance is less of a rhythm game and more of a jump around your living room game. Theres no complex patterns to memorize and the game is forgiving of less than perfect accuracy. Players simply mimic on-screen dancers and try their best to nail the moves as well. Doing so earns points which increases the star rating at the end of the song. Theres no way to lose and it, unlike something like DDR, doesnt make you realize youre a horrible dancer. While this would be frustrating for almost any other rhythm game, Just Dance makes it clear from the outset that this is purely a game about having fun and not about learning how to dance. Unless you spend time studying dances and practicing your moves (which can be personally rewarding), youll probably leave Just Dance no better a dancer than when you started. Thats absolutely fine, however, as trying your best to nail the creatively-choreographed dance moves is a blast.The interface of Just Dance 2014 is one of the smoothest yet, taking cues from Just Dance 4, and immediately drops players into the game with the entire song selection just a swipe away. Theres no tutorial, story or need to unlock stages. You, well, just dance. Many modes return from previous titles like Battle, Mash-up and Sweat. Battle has two players performing a choreographed dance that has them play fighting attempting to nail the most dance moves for dominancy, Mash-up takes a song and adds multiple dancers plus new choreography that frequently changes and Sweat is for those who are playing to get a workout. Sweat lets you play multiple songs in a row for ten, twenty or forty minutes and tracks burnt calories in real time. You can follow the pre-selected or random program or simply choose the songs yourself. While theres not as much movement as pad-based games like DDR, Just Dance will certainly get you sweating and out of breath after extended sessions.In addition to the returning modes, Just Dance 2014 adds a few other modes, most of which are quite novel. On Stage lets two players become backup dancers to the star, leading to realistic and neat looking choreography with friends  especially for those who enjoy putting on performances with the game. Karoke has been added to the game for the first time ever, although its less about belting out pitch perfect notes and more about correctly yelling the lyrics. As many people who play the game find themselves belting the songs aloud anyways, its a smart addition that adds more interactivity to the game. Of course for those who are more shy or simply dont want to sing, its not a requirement and simply adds bonus points to a performance.Theres also a new one-off Chair mode this year which takes Gwen Stefanis Rich Girl and choreographs the song with a chair in the center. With plenty of sexually suggestive moves, its an odd addition for a game intended (almost) for all ages, but it adds a new dancing dynamic that should both be appreciated by onlooking spouses and lead to plenty of awkward moments with practically everybody else.Just Dance 2014 boasts one of the best soundtracks of the series, no thanks in part to the improved popular music landscape this year. Highlights include Daft Punks Get Lucky, Robin Thickes Blurred Lines, Duck Sauces Its You, Lady Gagas Applause and more. Additionally, Katy Perrys current smash hit Roar is included via a DLC code in the box. Theres also a fair selection of joke songs including Prince Ali from Aladdin, Ghostbusters from Ray Parker, Jr. and the ever-present Y.M.C.A. from the Village People. Theres some stinkers too like #thatPOWER from the horrifying collaboration of will.i.am and Justin Bieber, but most of the selections are solid for popular music. As always, it would be preferable if they included a handful of non-pop songs popular in the dance world or some indie tracks, but this will likely always remain the Now Thats What I Call Music of video games.Closing Comments:", "date": "November 22, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
