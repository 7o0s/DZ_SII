{"name": "Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Regia", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=144588", "text": "In the world of visual novels there are an immense amount of games which never receive an English-language release. Until recently, it had seemed Littlewitch Romanesque was left to that fate. Originally released back in 2005 in Japan, the unique tale of magic, mystery and romance seemed an impossible localization proposition. As it turned out, however, JAST USA had their eye on the product and have since released two versions  Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Regia and Editio Perfecta. This review is of the former, although there will be brief description as to the differences later on.Littlewitch Romanesque tells the story of Domino, a young wizard who has just been given the powerful rank of Archmage. All he wishes to do is explore the Dark Tower, which is said to house ancient magical power, but the Grimoire (basically, a group of appointed wizards) dont grant him unrestricted access. In order for him to inhabit and search the Tower he must agree to take care of two young apprentices  Aria and Kaya. Both girls are full of youthful exuberance, but completely unskilled in the art of magic. Domino has three years to raise them into skilled witches or else he will have failed his side of the bargain.As might be expected from children, the girls are a handful. Aria is a direct descendant of royalty but hardly acts the part. Her stubborn, silly demeanor makes it seem she doesnt even care about magic despite an inherent affinity. As for Kaya, her youth was troubled and led her to being adopted by Grimoire wizards. She provides an exact opposite of Aria in that she is quiet, kind, and is ready to pursue magical studies. Although these are your protoge, the Dark Tower is quickly filled with other characters as well. For whatever reason, nearly all these new tenants just happen to be women. Visual novel fans should be used to this sort of harem setup.Dont let this make your perception of Littlewitch Romanesque turn to that of a vapid game with nothing more than pretty characters to pursue. In fact, much of the game focuses its storyline on magical elements and character development. Reading through provides an involving story which feels open enough to appeal to all sorts of folks. If, for example, you were ever taken in by the Harry Potter series youll probably feel right at home in this games world. Without the inclusion of sexual content in Editio Regia it furthers that mass appeal because there are definitely players who would find it uncomfortable  -or wouldnt be old enough to even play. Even people who arent in love with visual novels might find the gameplay engaging.Much of the gameplay comes in the form of a dice minigame. Basically, in order to train Aria and Kayas magical abilities you must roll two sets of dice. Each face has a symbol on it which corresponds to a type of magical training. Whichever dice faces are facing up at the end of a roll are added as little stat boosts for their respective girl. However, players or either character herself can initiate spells. They activate automatically if certain symbols all show at once and offer the ability to multiply stat boosts and other great features. Despite a slightly perplexing set up the game quickly becomes second nature. Once youve accumulated enough skill points they can be traded for new fancily-named spells. These spells are necessary for taking on quests.Each quest has its own requirements, and without the right spell, you simply cant take part. Although quests begin quite slowly, as Littlewitch Romanesque goes on youll find they become absolutely overwhelming. At that point you must strategize which quests to accept and which should be allowed to disappear. The hectic nature of quests means you wont be able to boost relationships with every character and see every single story facet in one playthrough. The forced time constraint is a bit annoying for completionists!No matter what, always ensure your duo has the required skills for a yearly exam. Without them, youre in big trouble. Because of the magical/weird names of spells, youll likely have to take notes to keep track of which spells need to be learned, as well as which are your personal favorites. Its a bit of an annoyance to do so, as the array of spells is basically too vast to ever fully commit to memory. Well, thankfully the only issue you might ever have because of naming is needing to double check that youre learning the right spell.Beyond the surprisingly compelling gameplay in Littlewitch Romanesque theres the stand out artstyle. Basically no one can look at the game without commenting on it, and with good reason. It looks absolutely beautiful with watercolor-esque colors and a focus on details. Sure, it still falls into the anime art category, but still manages to have a wonderfully hand drawn flair. It must be noted that the art in some CGs as well as spell cards have seen slight censoring for Editio Regia. Before it showed some nude and suggestive imagery which has been gently altered. Some may find this a huge issue, but considering how young Aria and Kaya are supposed to be its a surprise even more wasnt done to cover the art up. Even in absence of erotic content some players will likely be disturbed by what art (and a certain character design in particular) have been left intact.The main difference between Editio Regia and Editio Perfecta is that the former lacks any of the actual sex scenes. Instead, youre typically given romance scenes which helps establish relationships without actually displaying them in a graphic way. This was a necessary move to get the game approved for Steam. The argument of sexuality versus violence being acceptable has come up tons in regards to the decision, but Valve simply has a stance against explicit sexual content. If you are personally aggrieved by the censoring then you may purchase Editio Perfecta through JAST USA and receive a Steam code as a bonus.Closing Comments:Littlewitch Romanesque is a gorgeous, enthralling visual novel. Not only is the magical storyline interesting but the cast of distinct characters really bring the world to life. This is counterbalanced by a surprisingly addictive gameplay system which pairs luck with strategy in order to take on tons of quests. In absence of adult content, the game still stands tall as both its storyline and gameplay are excellent. Theres no need to lure players in with sexuality, unlike some other titles. Littlewitch Romanesque is a must-play visual novel and its split Editio Regia and Editio Perfecta release make it so all players can experience the game just the way they like.", "date": "April 16, 2015", "grade": 4.5}
