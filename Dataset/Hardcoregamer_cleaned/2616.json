{"name": "Super Black Bass 3D", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=33954", "text": "Super Black Bass 3D isnt just another fishing game  its the latest entry in the series that invented the genre. First released in 1986 (thats twenty seven years for those keeping score) for the Japanese MSX home computer, the game was ported to the NES a few years later. Even though it was met with middling reviews, it proved successful (to the point that carts still litter the most outdated pawn shops) and became a recognized title in gaming. Perhaps due to its lukewarm reception or because superior franchises were born, the series languished even with a string of predominantly Japanese exclusive sequels, never producing another notable entry. The last time we saw a release in the series was 2006s critically ravaged Super Black Bass Fishing. So what we have here is the 3D debut of one of the longest-running video game series that many have heard of but never played that receives consistently poor reviews and mainly exists to be a fishing series that, well, exists. In the words of Scooby Doo, ruh-rohWhile fishing games tend to be generic, at least some have tried to add some color to the affairs. The main character of the recently released Lets Fish! Hooked On, for instance, was a possibly-underage girl inexplicably sporting fangs, with her fly open and panties exposed. While thats not a positive, at least it was interesting. Here, however, you play as the most generic looking character model that never speaks, cant be customized and goes by whatever name you give them. Supporting characters consist only of a stereotypical TV host (why there is a dude in a suit with spiked hair and a microphone at a fishing tournament is anyones guess) and a female you work foror withor something, who is the most generic female looking character model possible and named Mary  they couldnt even be bothered to think up a creative name. Throughout the game, you can either enter tournaments, do a training mode or use a free mode, but it all adds up to one thing  fishing.Some people just do not like fishing games; Im not one of them, as I sunk hours into Sega Bass Fishing on the Dreamcast, played my fair share of Rapala and tried a smorgasbord of one-offs. When the gameplay is thought-out and presented in a polished package, the genre can be quite fun. Super Black Bass 3D, however, features wretched enough gameplay that it may actually sour casual fans on the genre itself. After choosing a mode, you set off to a shore and fish. To cast your fishing line overhead, you hold the 3DS vertically and flick it away from you, and to pitch it underhand, you move it towards you in a scooping motion. While its a neat idea to utilize the handhelds gyroscope for fishing, it just feels wrong. If you cast without holding the top screen, it flips your top screen back and feels like its going to snap off  especially on a 3DS. The game recommends you hold the top screen with your thumbs when casting  certainly a must  but doing so doesnt feel realistic or comfortable and is laughable that this workaround is the official way to play the game according to the safety rules in the tutorial.Ironically, however, casting is probably the gameplay mechanic that works best. Once the line and lure are in the water, you hold A to reel it in. Thats it; no choice of speed, method or direction. Worse yet, it comes back at a snails pace. Most of the time will be spent holding the A button waiting for the line to retract and cast again in a better area with more fish. While Lets Fish! had the problem of there being too many fish that dont bite frequently enough, Super Black Bass 3D has far too few that dont bite frequently enough. When the right lure is equipped, its a realistic ratio for fish that are curious, but anything besides will result in an almost complete lack of interest. When a fish bites your lure, you raise the 3DS vertically to hook it. Once hooked, the fish tries to get away and has to be fought to successfully reel in. The struggles of the fish, however, are laughable. When trying to escape, it simply slowly moves away in a straight line. The game says in the tutorial that fish will attempt to fight by moving left or right and must be countered by moving the analogue stick in the opposite direction, but they never do. They sometimes slightly curve one way, but it seems to have no implication on how it should be reeled in. When a fish is finally tired out, it literally stays motionless in a straight line slowly retracting until it fights again and then stays nearly motionless going in a straight line away from you. The whole thing can take up to four minutes and plays out practically the same throughout the game.Itd be abysmal enough if it werent for how easy it is for line to snap, with tugging up just a second too long breaking it. Once broken, the fish gets away and youre forced to go into a menu to equip a new lure and line. While that normally wouldnt be an issue, here youre given a finite amount to start with that must be resupplied via funds awarded from selling caught fish. If supplies are depleted before a tournament is over, theres no way to exit out to buy more. Each tournament day must be quit one by one and the sluggish results and information manually skipped. Worse yet, if supplies and money are exhausted (especially early on), it becomes unplayable due to the fact that theres no money to buy supplies and no supplies to catch fish and receive money.Making things more intolerable are the substandard graphics that look more like an old DS title than anything released in 2013. Almost everything in the game is rendered horribly and heavily pixelated, from the fish to the water to the lures. Characters models get it the worst and look like something out of some nightmarish Game Boy Advance game. Worse yet (I feel like thats been said far too many times), the 3D is one of the poorest showings the console has to offer, with such little depth that I routinely made sure I didnt accidentally slide the depth adjuster down. Even if you could see it, mixing a motion game with a 3D one is an awful idea. The 3DS needs to be viewed with the sweet spot to properly see the effect, but constantly jerking around the console makes it hard to see straight and is a headache waiting to happen.Closing Comments:", "date": "April 1, 2013", "grade": 1.0}
