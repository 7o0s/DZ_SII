{"name": "Table Top Racing (PS Vita)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=97605", "text": "Table Top Racing was a huge hit when it was first released on iOS devices in 2013. An Android release in March 2014 as both a free and paid app expanded its fanbase even more, and now weve got the first portable system incarnation of it on the Vita. Its a third-person racer with a minor hint of car combat thrown in. If you combined the viewpoint of Twisted Metal with the gameplay of Rock n Roll Racing or RC Pro-Am, you would basically wind up with this. You start off controlling an ice cream truck, but later get other vehicle types to use through a fairly wide variety of mode types.There are basic races, combat-based variants on them with weapons allowed, time trials, hot laps, elimination races, and a Chase H.Q.-esque pursuit mode where you have to hit a rival within a certain time limit to win. Each mode thrives on fast action and thats where Table Top Racing falters a bit when compared to other games in its genre on a controller-centric platform. The standards are completely different with each setup, because a mobile setup doesnt really allow for super-fast action  you always need to be forgiving due to a touch/tilt control setup taking a bit longer to do things in than a basic controller-based one.When youve got a system with a Wipeout game on it, you can experience an exciting racing game and see just how addictive one can be on the platform. Playing this reminds me of the old SNES vs. Genesis ads where you have one thing going at mach-speed in Sonic and then show Mario moving in relative slow-motion by comparison. Sure, whats here is technically well-executed and it controls nicely, but its also fairly slow-moving compared to other racing experiences on the Vita. This would hold true on the PSP as well, which had a stellar library of racers in its own right with many also playable on the Vita. Table Top Racing needs more core content and more exciting gameplay to truly reach its potential. The idea of a revival of the Micro Machines small racers in a big world, but with a combat kart racer dressing is solid. The execution here is flawed though. Theres a fair amount of mode variety, but the core racing action is the same with only weapons and collisions altering things radically. Like a kart racer, you have some weapons, but the weapon count is incredibly low. It makes that aspect of the game feel half-baked even if it is a perfect port of the mobile product.Theres a lot of needless carry-over between the formats as well. The entirely touch-based menus are a disappointment. Sure, the Vita has a touch screen, but this is an arcade-style racer and touch commands make menu navigation take longer than just a basic d-pad and button setup. This is a minor issue during pre and post-race menus, but in-game, it means that youll be spending valuable time pausing and unpausing without being able to immediately control your vehicle. This leaves you open to being passed quickly or being open for attacks, and is something the devs hopefully patch up later on. I also encountered a fairly odd issue where the camera would seemingly go behind the vehicle at random times, which means that you cant see the track in front of you. There doesnt appear to be a set camera button, and this problem can manifest itself in any of the games modes.Visually, the Vita version of Table Top Racing is about the same as the Android version on the highest settings. This results in a game that looks fairly good on the small screen, with some iffy-looking textures on most things. Road textures always look odd, while reality-based items like beef patties and generally any food-based items look like plastic toy versions of the real deal. While thats within the realm of plausibility for a racing game like this that uses miniature vehicles, it doesnt look correct to the eye and it winds up looking a bit cheap. The vehicles themselves look fine though. Theyre not mind-blowing, but considering the games mobile origins, theyre acceptable. Boost trails are quite impressive, as are many background objects  however, the overall appearance of the game isnt quite as good as it could be. When youre playing it, you can basically make a checklist in your head of things that could be improved, and it would be interesting to see this basic concept back, but optimized for more powerful hardware.Musically, theres nothing special or memorable about whats offered up here. Youve got generic rock slathered on top of more generic rock, with muffled sound effects that dont really get across any kind of action or mayhem. I understand not wanting violent sound effects since its a kid-friendly game, but kids WANT that kind of stuff and its just not here. What makes things even more annoying is that the music actually loops, and its not even good when you first hear it, let alone the second time you hear it in a single race. Even the sound your RC car makes while driving is nothing special. Theres just no oomph to anything you hear and it really bogs down the presentation. Youve got a great-looking game that plays reasonably well, and controls like a dream with a controller, but the audio just doesnt match up to the standard set by every other element of the game.Closing Comments:", "date": "August 14, 2014", "grade": 2.5}
