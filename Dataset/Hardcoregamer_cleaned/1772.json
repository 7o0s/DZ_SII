{"name": "Assassins Creed Rogue", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=117340", "text": "Assassins Creed Rogue is very much the Adam of Ubisofts labors. Its a patchwork of old assets, borrowed mechanics and whits of creativity only narrowly knotting the yarns of the franchises highlights. Despite an obvious lack of fresh material, however, Rogue manages to spin an experience rarely spoiled by the footprints of its forebears. And while its offerings are predictable, its circus-tent of shipwrecks, islands and collectibles make for a surprisingly fun dj vu.The story follows the same stab-happy formula weve come to tolerate (and love, occasionally), focusing on the high-minded transformation of protagonist Shay Cormac; a bloodthirsty creed-enforcer turned upper-crust Templar. While hardly as compelling as Ezios passionate tale of revenge or Edwards sloppy piratical escapades, exploring the age-old fracas of competing brotherhoods from a previously unplumbed perspective is, at times, thrilling.While the overall narrative isnt strong enough to support the weight of Rogues color-by-number setup (and its shockingly short for a full retail release), the faction vs. faction template has been refashioned just enough to scratch the surface of intrigue. Yes, theres still plenty of sneaking through circles of high-alert in search of a kill, theres plenty smooth scaling of lumpy buildings, trees and ships, the same seamless naval warfare and a desultory assortment of to-dos. Ultimately, its the killing of various assassins  characters youd likely befriend in another game about another protagonist  that pushes the story forward.Gameplay, not unlike the story and characters and world and [insert additional feature], boasts essentially the same mechanics found in Assassins Creed: Black Flag. Sailing through Poseidons bowl of icy North Atlantic danger is a blast, and exploring beaches, settlements and wilderness is wildly reminiscent of every single entry in the Assassins Creed series. The busier slice of world, New York, provides little change in formula as well, although in spite of its sameness theres always plenty to do and see if youre willing to throw on a pair of rosy lenses.Extracurricular activities, on the other hand, arent quite as unsubstantiated. Most story-breaking diversions, while mechanically monotonous, arent the exercise in repetition Black Flags never-ending map of content extends. Theres always something new to do, be it infiltrate a fort or explode an enemy vessel, and even with its complete lack of multiplayer, Rogue is a veritable ragbag of busyness. The problem is that, in essence, nothing has changed. Having spent countless hours in Black Flags playground, Rogues slab feels very much scratched, cracked and shattered.As is the case with most entries in the series, Rogues slew of collectibles  different from Black Flags only in text and image  are filler. Maps, gems and fragments of an ancient sword are constant gestures of superficial progress, but nothing more. The Series base renovation makes a return, too, allowing players to improve various buildings across the maps assorted townships. While improving properties will help pay for darts, trinkets and upgrades youll no doubt demand throughout your journey, the system itself can be an enjoyable pastime in its own right, and patient players willing to fiddle with its menus are greatly rewarded.Like most everything else in Rogue, the formulaic combat hasnt changed in the slightest. Slashing, stabbing, firing, dodging and counter-attacking all make a triumphant  if clunky  return. This, as might be expected, makes hand-to-hand action the least enjoyable aspect of the game, which is invariably a reminder that the series abrading mechanics have long been in need of an update. New toys, such as the air rifle and grenade launcher, arent entirely helpful outside of particular encounters and appear pretty infrequently.Rogues new feature, though not as substantial as Unitys co-op or Black Flags introduction of seamless seafaring gameplay, is far and away its most refreshing inclusion. As a Templar, youll often become the target of an assassination, encouraging you to scan your surroundings for looming danger. Naturally, the goal is to avoid detection and, when possible, tilt the odds in your favor. As you rush across rooftops or shoot through crowds, youll sometimes hear the whispers of an approaching attacker. Switching to Eagle Vision and locating the hired-blade is integral to your survival, as failing to locate the assassin will result in a hefty chunk of damage and a race through town.Sadly, the Stalker feature is also a weak link in Rogues repertoire. When it works, its fantastic, offering a new approach to gameplay thats both exciting and fun. When it doesnt, however, its incredibly frustrating. And more often than not, the camera is to blame.Visually, Rogue sits alongside Black Flag admirably. Lush greenery, deep oceans and rickety shacks look fantastic  if youre willing to forget that current-gen consoles exist for the entirety of your playthrough. And the sounds, while mostly consisting of Black Flags tunes and shanties, are always fittingly enjoyable. Closing Comments:For all its faults: the agonizing familiarity, the workable plot, the insipid characters and, perhaps worst of all, the intrinsic absence of novelty common in most of the series open worlds, Assassins Creed Rogue  Unitys last-gen partner in crime  is astoundingly stable. It spins the gears of entertainment often enough to justify its cut-and-paste design, and offers a wellspring of activities to tackle, encounters to conquer and treasures to unearth  despite having been borrowed from previous installments. Diehards will find themselves deeply engaged in the series first attempt at moralizing the plight of the Templars. Its a fitting end to the Kenway Trilogy, and with a few exciting moments and plenty to do, theres reason enough to set course for another piratical adventure and test the waters of change another day.", "date": "November 17, 2014", "grade": 3.5}
