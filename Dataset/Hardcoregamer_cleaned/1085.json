{"name": "Slain!", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=200066", "text": "It may seem odd to begin this review directing you to another set of reviews, but if you go to the Steam page for Slain! and scroll down, youll see that the vast majority of the games user reviews can be summed up with one simple theme: I wanted to like Slain! Indeed, never have five words been so accurate about a game that aspired to be something so grand, yet failed where it mattered the most. Slain! initially comes off like the worlds most amazing Mastodon concert, but quickly devolves into something more akin to a Three Days Grace show instead.The setup in Slain! is that you are Bathoryn, a hero in a Gothic world resurrected to stop a bunch of evil overlord becausebecauseeh, never mind. The mere bits of story that the game has are but a wafer-thin excuse to drop you into an old-school Castlevania game as re-imagined by Dethklok. And not a metroidvania game, mind you. Were talking pre-Symphony of the Night here, so its pure side-scrolling action throughout various contained levels.Right off of the bat, the first thing that youll notice is that Slain! looks absolutely incredible. Gorgeous pixel artwork peeks out of every corner, swimming with detail down to every bit of blood-soaked scenery and patch of fog rolling by. The game clearly has a ton of fun with the classic aesthetics of heavy metal, with medieval scenery, monstrous statues, and grotesque monsters everywhere. Appropriately enough, a wailing metal soundtrack provided by former Celtic Frost member Curt Victor Bryant accompanies your every move, guitar shreds playing as you slice an enemy in half. Its all makes for a gleefully over-the-top atmosphere to play inso its a shame that creating atmosphere is where the strengths of Slain! end. See, after the games aesthetic, the next thing youll notice about Slain! is that it does a horrible job explaining anything. In fact, it explains absolutely nothing when it comes to the games controls. Be it how to use mana to shoot projectiles or how to decapitate enemies to restore said mana, youll be fumbling about with your controller trying to figure out how to even do anything.And thats not even getting into techniques that require more than one button. Early on, the game informed me that a Spirit Bomb would be effective against multiple enemies, but damned if it was actually going to let me know how to pull one off, not even in the menu screen. As it turns out, you have to crouch and then press the button for decapitations, and you can only use it when your mana is at full capacity, all of which I had to learn by searching the Steam forums (and why you dont use the button for mana-based projectiles in a maneuver to drop a projectile that uses all of your mana is beyond me).Maybe all of this would be excusable if the gameplay was more solid, but shocker of shocks, it is not. I enjoy a simple platformer as much as the next person, and the classic platforming action was fun for the first little bit, but the ball is thoroughly dropped when it comes to combat. Slain! describes itself as Putting a strategic twist on the classic hack and slash games of the 80s and 90s, but the part about a strategic twist is a lie. Youre encouraged to use mana against enemies and restore it by decapitating them at the right time and to use elemental attacks against certain enemies, but the majority of the games enemies do little more than gradually creep towards you, so mashing the attack button and simply slashing your way through works fine. Heck, it even works against the larger enemies, since all you have to do is hit them at the right time in order to interrupt their attack animations.Of course, Slain! still has to put up a challenge worthy of the NES days, but it does so via the most annoying methods: Enemies with cheap attacks (some of which can kill you in two hits) traps that can kill you instantly (but are easily avoidable), and yet another return of our old pal, large groups of enemies as a substitute for challenge. The former is the one that hurts the most, and it doesnt help that in multiple cases, a bug caused an enemys fire attack to kill me even after I had stepped into the area where the fire had cleared. And indeed, there will be bugs. I didnt encounter anything as horribly botched as other players have noticed (I should note that I was also playing with a controller, as the keyboard controls apparently suffer from lag so terrible the store page just suggests only using a controller for now), but I had my moments where I clipped through the floor, somehow triggered insta-death traps I didnt walk into, and in one instance, jumped off of a ledge only to be teleported a huge distance away all of a sudden.And while the games aesthetics are amazing, as previously mentioned, they actually start to work against you at times. Detecting whether or not an enemy makes contact with you becomes difficult with a whole chaotic mess of detail going on at once, and the metal music actually overpowers sound effectswhen there are even sound effects to begin with, as even enemy projectile are mostly silent. And there are some baffling design choices as well, such as having a hub area where you can select your next level, except the only way you can return to it is to either beat the current level or quit the game and load it again. No, not even death can return you to it, only plopping you back at the next checkpoint after enthusiastically telling you YOU HAVE BEEN SLAIN! After the hundredth or so time, though, I wasnt sharing in said enthusiasm.Closing Comments:Slain! gleefully comes off as the fever dream of a drunken teenage Iron Maiden fan, but unfortunately comes off as having been designed and programmed by a drunken teenage Iron Maiden fan as well. Astounding graphics, music and ambition sadly dont make up for the horrible design choices, fake difficulty and amount of glitches. Its easy to fall in love with Slain!, but it sadly ends up ripping out your heart and eating it onstage in the end. Just wait for Deaths Gambit to get your medieval-themed old-school Castlevania fix instead.", "date": "March 30, 2016", "grade": 2.0}
