{"name": "The Jungle Book (PC)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=219771", "text": "2016 will give us the re-release of a 1994 game based on a 1967 film adaptation of a book published in 1894. The game in question that was a massive pile of retroness well before it was retro itself is Virgins The Jungle Book, which was available on numerous 8 and 16-bit systems back in the early Mesozoic Era, more often referred to in the common vernacular as the 1990s. Disney movies are often regarded as timeless classics that are rediscovered by children in every new generation, that is whenever Disney decides to re-release a film from their vault. Virgin seems to be following suit by reviving a few Disney games so that they may be experienced by a new generation as well as revisited by those who had these games as part of their childhood. As most of us are aware, video games are somewhat akin to wine. Some of them are quite enjoyable after spending many years maturing, while the passage of time may reduce others to being as pleasing to the palette as vinegar. Let us discuss The Jungle Book and ascertain if it has aged like a fine wine or decayed into an acidic liquid of grapes gone bad.The Jungle Book allows the player to take control of the man cub Mowgli. Armed with weaponized projectile bananas and the Mario-esque ability to crush his enemies by jumping on their heads, Mowgli traverses the Indian jungle to make his way back to the village of humans to escape the tiger Shere Khan who despite the fact tigers rarely hunt humans, Shere Khan has a craving for wolf raised man meat. Certain items are placed throughout the level that make this journey a little easier such as masks that grant temporary invincibility or weapon power ups such as double banana shots and boomerang bananas which should have been called bananarangs.Each level requires Mowgli to explore a section of jungle and collect gems. Each level has fifteen gems, and collecting all fifteen unlocks a bonus level. When Mowgli collects the minimum required amount of gems, the level can be completed by finding a friendly character such as Baloo or finding the boss character to fight such as Kaa. The amount of gems required for each level is determined by the difficulty level: practice requires eight, normal needs ten, and hard mandates twelve. The layout of each level requires both vertical and horizontal exploration. Despite being raised by wolves, Mowgli is quite adapt and swinging through the trees with the greatest ease like those hairy lower life forms we call monkeys. Swinging from tree to tree on vines, climbing vines, and leaping from branch to branch are all common activities for this trans species man cub who was raised by wolves and behaves like a monkey (waiting for a zoologist to school me in the comments section about how he is more like an ape which is not the same as a monkey).The exploratory approach that is available for each level does give it a somewhat nonlinear feel and flinging Mowgli through the treetops does result in some very enjoyable platforming. The flip side to this is that despite that the gameplay is fun it is also very repetitive. More variety in level design or objective could have enhanced the experience, but suggestions for changes to the game design would have probably been more helpful a couple decades ago. With all the re-releases of classic games this phrase should be programmed to a hotkey command: the graphical limitations of its time are more apparent than ever thanks to higher resolution displays, being spoiled by improved graphics technology with modern games, and the nostalgia filter convinces you that impressive graphics for its time were really better than they were. That being said, if you ignore the pixelation the graphics hold up fairly well. The animation still looks fluid and the characters look like accurate depictions of their counterparts in the animated film, and arguably about as close to the quality of the film as one could expect for the platform and the year it was released. Some songs from the film are presented in what I have dubbed Chiptune Muzak (trademark pending). The audio/visual quality does make this a nice counterpart to the film.The controls for the PC reissue are surprisingly smooth and responsive. Customizing the control pad input does not seem to go as smoothly as it should which I suspect may be a common theme with these Virgin Disney reissues but honestly the default gamepad commands feel just as natural as if it were played on an actual Sega Genesis or SNES. The use of a keyboard for a control input is supported, though I would only suggest that for people seeking the ultimate challenge or those who simply hate themselves and want to suffer. Closing Comments:The Jungle Book is not the strongest Disney licensed game in existence, but worth checking out for fans of the film. Even without the Disney license, it is a respectable platformer based on its own gameplay merits. The repetitious nature of the levels is its biggest stumbling block; the game is fun to play, but the lack of variety can cause some to lose interest before completing it. Taking a childrens movie and converting it to an action platformer is something that I imagine would be a fairly difficult task as far as being faithful to the source material and still make a game that is entertaining, which is where The Jungle Book succeeds. If this game was part of your childhood it is fairly safe to revisit without tainting the memories, or if theres little ones in your life that are experiencing Disney movies for the first time, this could be a good movie supplement.", "date": "August 5, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
