{"name": "Game of Thrones: Episode Two  The Lost Lords", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=133507", "text": "Its hard to tell whether you can even classify Telltales work as games anymore. Yes, there is interaction, there is player agency and there is even some semblance of gameplay, but at a certain point, it ceases to be a video game and starts to be a lightly interactive movie. Were not quite there yet, but The Lost Lords, the latest episode of Telltales Game of Thrones series, walks a fine line and nearly tumbles over into Dragons Lair territory. Its not significantly different than the first episode in its style of interaction, but now that theres an established story with actual momentum, theres just less reason for the game to offer you chances to go off the beaten path. Still, all the same problems from the first episode are present and accounted for here, including an ugly presentation, amateurish animation, technical problems, achingly slow pacing and the simple fact that your choices so rarely matter at all.The Lost Lords isnt afraid to introduce new characters or bring back unexpected old ones, and that helps keep the episode feeling a little more dynamic than might be expected; youre not just watching the same pieces shuffle around the chessboard. As teased at the end of the last episode, players begin as Asher, the blondest and most rebellious Forrester son, as his uncle searches to bring him home  regardless of whether or not you chose to send him in the first episode. Asher is the typical Han Solo archetype, an outlaw with a heart of gold who meets danger with little more than a rogueish grin and his stylish haircut. Hes got an interesting relationship going on with his more dangerous mercenary partner, Beskha. Theyre flirty, but independent, kind of like a less hostile version of the relationship between Joel and Tess from The Last of Us. Its a good dynamic, one that wouldve been preferable to explore instead of jumping straight into a terrible quick time event fight scene.The basic actions range between boring and frustrating. On the boring end, youll need to press left or right when an arrow comes up or tap a face button, which is easy enough that youll be able to watch the fight scene at hand, at least. On the frustrating end, occasionally an icon will appear in-world  on a persons head, on a dagger, etc.  and youll need to move a circle over it and press a trigger button. Thats probably not all that difficult on a mouse, but with a controller, trying to line up that circle with the analog stick over a moving target and hit the button at the right time just isnt fun or satisfying. There are also occasional timed button prompts where a circle will close in around the required button icon, a mechanic you might want to treat like a rhythm game and assume that youre meant to hit the button the moment the circle finally rings the button, but really, you just have to sit back and ignore it because its just a fancy visual for a standard button prompt. This led me to a series of five or six deaths, each one causing the games music to cut out jarringly before being sent to a game over screen in silence. Quick time events are nothing new, but the ones presented here are decidedly bad. From there, youll take over a character that returns unexpectedly to fulfill the place of Ethan in the prior episode, tasked with dealing with the Whitehill occupation of Ironrath and taking over lordship of House Forrester; youll also check in on the continuing adventures of Mira and Gared as they deal with the lethal political machinations of Kings Landing and the icy roughness of the Nights Watch, respectively. Your time with these characters will mostly be spent engaging with the games dialogue system wherein youll have limited time to respond to (or deliberately abstain from) conversations as they play out. The majority of these dialogue options are just for flavor, a way for you to define who you want your characters to be and how they will act, but to the games credit, occasionally these conversations will have real consequences.Theres a particularly well-done scene where your character attempts to ensure that his betrothal is still in effect in light of recent events as it could be a determining factor in the survival of House Forrester; the outcome of this scene is decided by how you approach the situation in its entirety rather than one bolded choice. Of course, given the way Telltale handles choices and divergence, theres little confidence that the consequence will have any real meaning in subsequent episodes as all outcomes get folded into the same generic path, but its admittedly a well-done scene regardless. Its just too bad that the imprecise nature of the conversation system, where youre presented with a summary of what a character might say rather than exactly what will be said, can lead to frustration as your character says something that doesnt line up at all with what you thought theyd say and your outcome suffers as a result.Beyond sparring swords and words, the only other real interaction in The Lost Lords is to walk around and examine stuff. In a game like Grim Fandango Remastered, youre inspired to engage with every little thing thanks to witty dialogue and your characters interesting musings about the world around him. In The Lost Lords, its a chore. As Gared, youre given the option to walk around a small training area in Castle Black, and one of the objects you can examine is a door labelled Mess Hall. The only option is to look at it, and when you do, Gared says, thats the Mess Hall, which has to rank highly as one of the all-time most redundant lines of dialogue in gaming. Wish theyd serve more than stew there, Gared continues. In the genre where writing matters most, Telltale completely drops the ball with trite, uninspired dialogue, which is especially surprising given that the word count of the source material now measures in the millions. Theres an overabundance of beautiful, if dense, language to draw upon when writing the script for these games, but Telltales writers just arent up to the task.The Lost Lords isnt exactly solid on the technical front either. While there were plenty of bugs and glitches being reported with the first episode, I didnt encounter that many during my playthrough. The Lost Lords was much worse for me, however. The animations  which already remind me enough of the stilted, cartoonish work we did in my Intro to Computer Science class in college when they do work properly  hitched in nearly every scene and had a general jerkiness to the motion that distracted throughout. The sound was worse, with music abruptly cutting out, sound effects skipping like a dropped CD player, and dialogue that was either out of sync, looping, or duplicated on a delay. At one point, a character in a cut scene failed to load in completely, then suddenly popped in as Gared approached him. These issues would be bad enough if this was Telltales first game of the type, but these are the exact same types of issues I had with Telltales first game of the type, The Walking Dead, three years ago. Its simply not excusable anymore.Closing Comments:Itd be easy to overlook the The Lost Lords myriad issues  the awful presentation, the lack of true divergence, the general lack of polish  if it werent for its biggest problem: its boring. Even for diehard fans of the show or books, theres little to glean from these first two episodes so far. The first episode had a cool moment where you get to wither in the merciless gaze of Cersei, and this second episode has an interesting discussion where Jon Snow asks Gared about the events of the Red Wedding, and thats it. Theres no gameplay hook to latch onto and the writing and pacing both leave a lot to be desired. With better episodic adventure games coming out like Life is Strange that prove the genre can be fun, interesting and attractive, theres little reason to waste time with Telltales Game of Thrones series thus far.", "date": "February 8, 2015", "grade": 1.5}
