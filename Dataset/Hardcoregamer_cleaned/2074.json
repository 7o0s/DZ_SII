While a dedicated group of gamers remain, the majority of the playerbase has moved on to other competitive shooters. Hoping to spice things up, Guerrilla Games is introducing Co-Op to the game with Intercept. As both DLC and a standalone product, Intercept adds some great content, but only if you have four players.Intercept reshuffles the way Killzone: Shadow Fall is played. Instead of being able to equip anything, the game and its many weapons are separated into four different classes: Assault, Marksman, Medic and Tactician. Youre given a central base, four uplink beacons to defend, a bank, and a marketplace to purchase bonuses.Killzone: Shadow Fall  Intercept is hectic. As a team, points are collected by taking down Helghast, using abilities and healing allies. The more points accumulated, the higher the score multiplier increases. Points can be banked when enough are collected, adding to players total score, but all those points are lost should someone die before banking them. Its a risk/reward scenario that youll have to weigh based on how well the team is doing. Meanwhile, there are three uplink locations that have to be maintained. Losing the uplinks to the Helghast halts points from being banked, and could lead to a losing match. Theres a lot here to keep players busy.There are tools to make the fights a bit easier. Banking so many points unlocks capacitors, which can then be placed in the marketplace. Inside are some amazing bonuses including double damage, free respawns, mini-guns, mortar strikes, and the jetpack, which makes its return from Killzone 3. These are all good bonuses that can help teams get out of a sticky situation  commonplace in the game. The Helghast are relentless in their pursuit to end your life. Coming in large parties, theyre mean, nasty and brutal in their attempts to kill all four squad members. Theres plenty of challenge  much more than in the campaign  but this exposes Intercepts greatest flaw: Intercept is not fun unless you have a full squad. Ive tried solo, two, and three players, but it was never enjoyable until all four players were in. The assault class was neededto mow down enemies, the marksman to call out where enemies were coming in from, the tactician to draw fire with turrets and the medic to revive downed allies. Its a testament to Guerrilla Games balancing that they managed to make all four classes necessary, but its also a detriment to anyone who doesnt have four players in the party.There are only four maps included in Intercept  DMZ, The Outpost, Marketplace, and Outpost  and all are well designed for the Co-Op action. Guerrilla Games has promised six more Intercept maps for free, though when theyll be released is anyones guess. Alongside the new maps are trophies, challenges, and leaderboards, which are sure to keep the avid collector coming back. However, there arent any new guns, attachments, classes, or additions to the games competitive multiplayer component. Intercept is pure Co-Op. Closing Comments:", "date": "July 1, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
