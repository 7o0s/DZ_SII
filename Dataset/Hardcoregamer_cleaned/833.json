{"name": "Star Trek Online (Console)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=228145", "text": "Its a universe in turmoil. The Klingons, Romulans, Borg, Gorn and more are all looking to carve out a piece of the galactic cake for themselves. It is here that Cryptic Studios Star Trek Online takes place. Being a more casual Star Trek fan, up until recently, I had a bit of an issue nailing down the timeline. It takes place during or after the events from The Next Generation series and movies.  certainly after the events of Voyager as Admiral Janeway is referenced. This leads to a bit of confusion, as I thought that the issues with the Klingons were well sewn up after The Undiscovered Country. Even so, this is the setting and its up to players to explore the frontier, solving mysteries and sow peace through superior firepower when needed.Before beginning a review in earnest, it should be addressed that this is a free-to-play title. As such, ground rules had to be established (those who have read my Neverwinter review will be familiar with these.) First, no money can be spent. A truly good free to play game should not exert undue psychological pressure to drop cash in the till. The game should be fun to play on its own. This time was easier as there was no early access period with tempting goodies that had to be banked and ignored until the review was done. I also turned down the packs that get offered to press for the same reasons. Second, as an MMO, Star Trek Online is an enormous game. A limited cut off period was set, though it was extended by a weekend for further connection testing.The Federation storyline, which is the recommended starting point, begins with the player taking control of a fresh recruit. During a post-graduation training mission on a Miranda class vessel, the experienced captain is killed and the player becomes the highest ranked officer. After battling and escaping, the ship returns home and the admiral decides that proper reorganizing is work, and awards the ship to the player. It was from here that my adventures as Goatongue, ranking officer of the U.S.S. Rubble began. As an engineering specialist, his skills as an officer leans toward the making sure the hull doesnt implode line of thinking. Science officers focus on shield strength while tactical officers are all about weapon power. This is a gross over simplification, of course, but it seems the easiest way to explain the three classes. Structurally, the quest design is cool. Each feels like a contained micro-episode from the television series, with an assignment, plot twist(s), bouncing the graviton particle beam off the main deflector dish (thats the way we do things, lads. Making $%^& up as we wish), and finally a resolution. Myriad foes pop up, including an unexpected Undine or two, to keep the variety moving. As these quests are cleared, a larger, overarching plot begins to emerge. The way small nuggets of information are doled out, slowly revealing pieces of a bigger picture, helps sink the titles hooks deep into the flesh, like a Cenobite on a caffeine bender.Its a good thing that the overall plotting is well done, as some of the voice acting fights to cut the lines suspending the players disbelief. Lamentably, some of the voice work is poorly done, sinking to the level of bad community theater. Its not all terrible, but when it shows up, it cannot be ignored. The missions themselves are divided into two portions: space and ground. The space exploration and combat is a particular highlight. The way that the complex keyboard controls of the PC release were mapped to a gamepad works extremely well. With no acclimation period, the player can perform scans, relegate power from engines to shields to weapons, and pull off some serious tactical maneuvers with no effort. The way that the captains skills (read: spells) are mapped, and the ability to use expendable items immediately should be a mess with the reduced input options available. It is not.The same cannot be said for the ground combat. While the skills and whatnot use a similar style of mapping, target becomes a mess when putting boot to dirt. Initially, it seems like it uses a tried and true third person action control scheme. However, when going to iron-sights (or the Star Trek equivalent), the game likes to lock on to a completely invalid choice. The dude hanging out on a ridge a couple of kilometers away is vastly more interesting to the game than the Klingon currently carving large chunks out of the player with a Batleth. Ive shot teammates so many times that Im glad there isnt a mutiny option for the AI. With the streamlined starship engagements working so well, its really disappointing that manning an away team is such a mess. Doubly so when one considers that Cryptic Studios is also responsible for Neverwinter, the gold standard of free to play MMOs that does combat so well. The inventory management has some issues, as well. Star Trek Online has an incredible amount of equipment and quick items to use. The ships have varying numbers of fore and aft weapons to slot and upgrade. There are also different systems, like warp cores, and consoles to add to the ship to improve various stats and abilities. The player character and recruitable officers also have slots for weapons, armor, personal shields, kits, and expendables. The thing is, comparing a new item to what is already equipped is a pointless chore. I found myself constantly backing into and out of menus to get a better look before finally making a decision. Loads of time was spent on this alone until I finally decided to just equip a higher mark version and recycle the rest. Once again, Neverwinter handles this with much greater ease, allowing seamless switching and a wealth of information to be seen in a clean, painless way.This leads into the graphics. Much has gone into improving the look of this relatively old title before the move to current gen consoles. Overall, its rather well done. No one will mistake the console edition of Star Trek Online for a game that was built from scratch this year, but the lighting improvements does create some visually striking moments. Navigating an explosive gas field while hiding from Klingon Birds of Prey, or a suns rays glinting off of a newly acquired Constitution class ship (mine is the U.S.S. Unexploded) help to give this title those little moments. It should be noted that framerate can be an issue from time to time, though this can easily be explained away by the network connection. The drops seemed to take place more often in the evenings and weekends, when traffic is higher. Closing Comments:It feels like most of this review is spent pointing out issues that hampers Star Trek Onlines experience. While they are present, the game itself manages to rise above them to create a title is extremely difficult to put down. The overall plot and story beats are so well done that I found myself falling down the Star Trek fandom rabbit hole (this is a problem; Im nerdy enough even without tacking Trekkie to the bottom of my character sheet). Now that the review is done, I am seriously contemplating dropping some dough on one of the shinier ships. When not playing the game, Ive been watching various shows and movies set in the universe. Ive also started reading one of the books (A Shatner written one at that. I said it was a problem.) Frankly, Star Trek Online is a game that casual and dedicated Star Trek fans should check out. While it doesnt beat out Neverwinter as far as mechanics goes, it allows players to inhabit a fascinating facsimile of the universe, exploring, undertaking complex missions and always boldly going forward (because we cant find reverse).", "date": "Bohn on September 28, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
