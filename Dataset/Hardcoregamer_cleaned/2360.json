Every major release besides the Spolosion Man games, despite my going into them without any prior expectations, has failed to deliver. As such, I was leery of LocoCycle, despite its potential to be funny and exciting. Halfway through its bizarre ten-minute long live-action sequence, I found myself wondering what, exactly, I was doing playing this game as part of a brand new console launch.It felt shameful, to be sure, and it only got worse from there. LocoCycle shambles after IRIS, a runaway smart motorcycle manufactured by military arms maker Big Arms. Pablo, a Spanish-speaking mechanic, is dragged along on a tumultuous journey with the motorcycle on the way to a Freedom Rally in Indiana, because that means so much to her. I mean, it was the first thing she saw when she was activated, after all. And talking motorcycles just want to have fun. That part should be obvious.Gamers want to have fun as well, and LocoCycle doesnt exactly offer it in droves. Its not a racer and its not a platformer  its best described as an action game where you face off against the same few enemies over and over using IRIS as a brawler. Shes about as maneuverable as any cycle in a sandbox game where youre forced to use the same few moves to clear out the resident baddie population. Most of them involve slinging poor Pablo, whos chained to the back of IRIS, into them. Combat is far from intuitive or even exciting. Not only are the enemies you face the same (higher-ups from Big Arms are constantly after IRIS to bring her back to headquarters) but you can basically sit back and relax while you mash a couple of buttons to get through these segments. When youre forced to submit to minigames that find you fixing IRIS as Pablo, it gets even worse  youre never given concise instructions as to how youre actually supposed to perform them. Its as if Twisted Pixel forgot to include these in their most integral moments, leaving the game feel just about as unfinished as it looks.Whats really bizarre is the insistence upon forcing Pablo to speak only Spanish, so neither he nor IRIS can understand what the other is saying. In a world where language barriers can and do act as the cause of some humorous situations, youd think this might have made up for LocoCycles bizarre design decisions, but instead what it does is reduce Pablo to little more than a Hispanic setpiece that players can point and laugh at  oh, how funny this Spanish guy is! Hes speaking nonsense! Ha ha ha! Its painfully unfunny. Why even introduce a character like this? Its lost on me.For a next-gen title, aesthetics certainly arent LocoCycles strong suit, either. If you cant tell from the above screenshots, its decidedly flat, like a 2000s PC game. For an Xbox One game available at launch, it feels as though it would have been much more at home as just an Xbox 360 title, or perhaps a Wii game  thats what it feels more suited for. It feels weird to say this about a next-gen game, as its typically the graphics that save a lackluster title from total mediocrity, but even those couldnt save this game.Closing Comments:", "date": "November 25, 2013", "grade": 2.0}
