{"name": "Gran Turismo 6", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=64753", "text": "If theres a video game equivalent of going to an opera after a five star meal, its Gran Turismo. This is a series that oozes class and not much has changed in its latest entry. Not many games are content to begin with live action clips of their creation set to classical music, but this is a series that revels in its opulence. But in a world where the latest Need for Speed has you ramming into cops at hundreds of miles per hour, its nice to have an experience on the other end of the spectrum that strives to give its players a taste of the automobile high life. A last-gen game released at quite possibly the worst time imaginable (December weeks after the current-gen console released), Gran Turismo 6 is both the series last hurrah on PS3 and a title trying to to hold its own with Xbox Ones Forza Motorsport 5.Gran Turismo 6 is a simulation through and through, meaning that cars actually control like their real-life counterparts and wont be able to blaze through corners at full speed or receive a boost of nitrous with the touch of a button. The right to go faster than a hundred miles per hour must be earned from the track and current ride on it. With 120 new cars, Gran Turismo 6 features a whopping 1,200 vehicles from makers like Scion, Ford, Aston Martin, Audi, Bentley, Lotus, Maserati and Acura (hey, Acuras are really nice!). Unlike a lot of other racing games where the low end car is a Corvette, GT6s rides run the spectrum from a Honda Fit to McLaren MP4-12C. By having so many cars, players can not only get a taste of what it feels like to be behind the wheel of a half a million dollar piece of engineering, but also something more akin to what they would drive in everyday life. Hypothetically, one could even use the game to test drive their next daily driver.Cars are purchased by earning credits based on race performance. With over a thousand cars and a stingy system, however, dont expect to have a Lotus on day one. It will be a struggle to even purchase a 2005 Mustang, but as theres quite a bit to do with a steep learning curve, its just about where it needs to be. For those who arent instantly aware of the differences between two similar cars, a Performance Point rating is shown for each car that gives an idea on its overall capabilities. Helping the cars feel as real as ever is a revamped physics engine. Tires now take their structure into account, suspensions utilize vehicle analysis and aerodynamics include variables like vehicle orientation and shape. To put it simply, cars feel real.Multiple modes are included, with the centerpiece being Career Mode. A career features six difficulties including Novice, National B, National A, International B, International A and Super. To progress to the next difficulty, a license test consisting of five objectives must be completed. Basically, the game wants to ensure you werent just barreling off the track on turns and actually mastering its mechanics. Each difficulty features multiple cups and championships to complete. Some cups (and always the license test) require a certain number of stars to unlock. One star is given for simply completing an event, two for placing in the top three and three for coming in first. This system makes you replay events multiple times to accrue enough stars, but it wont be an issue once you have some experience under your belt. Breaking up the monotony of the events are Coffee Breaks. These are mini-games that feature a challenge like knocking down cones in a stadium or seeing how far you can get on a liter of gasoline. Although simple in nature, theyre surprisingly addictive and reminiscent of the Crazy Box in Crazy Taxi (the one time Crazy Taxi will ever be compared to Gran Turismo).Of course, theres plenty of car porn to be had with the help of excellent framed replays and other opportunities. One of the biggest is Photo Travel, which allows for any car to be photographed in a multitude of exotic locales like Ronda, Syracuse, Gemasolar and more. Unfortunately, this aspect of the series isnt as exciting as it usually is and highlights the games biggest flaw: old hardware. When the latest entry in a series known for its realism is released on a seven year old console, its cause for concern. Many have been playing their next-gen consoles non-stop the past few weeks and going from PS4 to PS3 suddenly feels like going from PS3 to PS2. The game looks great for a PS3 racing simulator, but its hard to look at it and not remember the gorgeous visuals of next-gen Need for Speed Rivals and Forza Motorsport 5.Closing Comments:", "date": "December 6, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
