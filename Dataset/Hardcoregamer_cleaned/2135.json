{"name": "Dark Scavenger", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=85272", "text": "There has been a consensus among much of the mainstream gaming industry that point and click adventure have been dead since the late 90s, but that isnt even remotely true. While the mainstream adventure genre has veered pretty heavily away from the point and click roots with games like L.A. Noire and Telltales brand of adventure games, the indie scene has kept the point and click torch burning for years. Most indie point and click games stick very close to the classic style of the 90s and dont do much new, but Dark Scavenger from Psydra Games is something a bit different; a hybrid of point and click and role playing games.While describing Dark Scavenger as a cross between a point and click adventure game and a role playing game is technically accurate, in reality it isnt truly either one. The primary aspects of those genres that Dark Scavenger incorporates are clicking on objects in the environment, dialogue trees, turn based combat, and loot. Anything beyond these three fundamental design elements, such as puzzle solving, leveling, or inventory management are completely absent from the game. Even without some of the deeper mechanics associated with adventure games and RPGs, Dark Scavenger is an enjoyable experience thanks to some excellent writing.The main draw of Dark Scavenger is without question the narrative elements. Whereas youll spend most of your time solving puzzles in most adventure games and engaging in combat in most role playing games, most of Dark Scavenger consists of dialogue. In fact, even with its surface similarities to those two genres, the game has much more in common with a text adventure or visual novel. Youll spend most of your time reading elaborate action scenes with very little animation and lots of opportunity for decision making. Those that would rather watch something happen than read about it may be a bit turned off by the very text heavy presentation, but if you can get past it Dark Scavenger is a great time.The writing is just fantastic, brimming with wit and a fair amount of dark comedy, and its made all the better by your ability to interact with it. As games have focused more and more on presentation with voice acting, motion capture, and photo realistic visuals, the realities of development have made it difficult to bring much variation to the choices players are presented with. With its very minimalist presentation, Dark Scavenger is able to constantly give you opportunities to make choices and have them make a difference. Youre not going to drastically alter the course of the story, but you do have lots of freedom to shape how you move through it.Dark Scavenger has an outstanding premise, but unfortunately the game mostly squanders its potential. You take the role of a new member of the Dark Scavengers, a group of space travelers that travel from planet to planet interacting with the local civilizations and finding all the loot they can. A set up like that is just full of opportunity for interesting and varied storytelling, but the game limits itself to a single planet. The sci-fi element of the story is almost nonexistent, with the planet the entire game takes place on more closely resembling a medieval fantasy setting than a science fiction one. Still, the characters and stories you come across here are still enjoyable, its just a shame more wasnt done with the sci-fi set up.Beyond the dialogue and decision making, Dark Scavenger does have some more mechanically based gameplay. The game is divided into five chapters, and within each you move from screen to screen interacting with objects and individuals. On each screen there will be a handful of things you can click on, which sometimes trigger an event or combat encounter while other times you get a line or two of flavor text. Events and combat encounters often reward you with loot, which then presents you with a decision.Back on your ship there are three fellow Dark Scavengers that each specialize in a specific crafting discipline. When you find a piece of loot you can then take it back to your ship and craft it into either a weapon, an item, or an ally, all of which are used in combat. You never know exactly what youre going to get when you craft a piece of loot, but the name of the object as well a brief hint from the crafter about what they can do with it will give you some sort of idea. Its often nerve-wracking trying to decide which crafter will yield the best result for a certain object, but thats part of the fun.Combat is where these decisions can either pay off or falter. The turn based combat isnt particularly noteworthy, but its competent. The various items and weapons you have each carry only a certain number of uses per chapter, so rationing over many battles is key. The actual combat is pretty straightforward, with several different types of damage that enemies can be weak or strong against and a single status effect, stun, to worry about. Its certainly not the deepest turn based combat system, and its more often than not very easy, but theres enough to it to be somewhat enjoyable, though its certainly not the games main draw.
