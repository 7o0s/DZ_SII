You wait for one and then two show up in quick succession. Where January heralded the canny yet provocative and engaging Pony Island, February sees Blooming Buds Studio take the reigns for monthly meddling with Calendula  a game that aims to take the border-breaching system of play that one step furtherby preventing you from ever reaching its content in the first place. A strange and perhaps self-defeating objective on surface you might think, but Blooming Buds work-around is  like all sinisterly-cunning titles prior  what you see is not always what you get.Calendula spends the majority of its three-to-four hour run-time having you navigate a series of menus that act as the supposed releases title screen and accompanying options respectively. For each repeated loop, greeted by the games ominously brooding title card and salvo of dark ambient shunts, a subtle yet boldly-apparent icon will reveal accompanying lines to a passage of text. Each line, in effect, offering subtle hints as to acquiring the necessary password which unlocks your save file in the Load Game option. Successfully loading your game shifts you to a bizarre first-person mode with little front-end delivery but, once more, sprinkled with static and abstract visages ranging from the off-putting to the absolutely ludicrous.Theres clearly an indisputable focus on wanting to leave the player feel, at the very least, awkwardly placed as to how this game is advancing. The way the title card gets increasingly more detailed and perhaps graphic is something that has the potential to be overlooked and the increasing sinisterness in its puzzles does conjure an obvious descent into otherwise orderly affairs. Its important to note these positives because for all its riddles and all its deliberately vague attempts at progression, Calendula comes off incredibly shallow in its final execution. While I wont deny Blooming Buds delve into some interesting mechanics with tuning, say, the audio and video settings, the adjoining part of the experience  the actual game  falls flat in adding meaning to whats come before.Throughout your time in first-person  which at the most extreme can last about thirty seconds tops  theres no real sign of advancing or even coming close to the otherwise deceitful truth behind Calendulas core pull. The fact your movement is restricted to one direction (forward) and is essentially built on-rails leaves the impression this has been the secondary as opposed to the primary focus. And while I was curious to know what these flashes of visuals and rather bloodied pallets of colour represented, its not all surprising that the end delivery  the supposed twist to all this  comes off rushed and sloppily explained.So its Calendulas title screen where most of the fun is to be had and in Blooming Buds defense, the way some puzzles are presented and/or shift into another form altogether will definitely take players by surprise. One puzzle, found late on in proceedings, shakes things up literally by splitting the screen up into slices  thus forcing you to navigate the still-functioning game whilst still in this jumbled mess. Such is the shame that this brand of puzzle-solving isnt covered as much or as intently in earlier proceedings as it shows a keen degree of startling its players and leaving them genuinely boggled. Unfortunately the only moments where players will perhaps feel startled, for all the wrong reasons, are during the first-person sections.One instance, which finds you surrounded by a sphere-shaped void full of eyes, ended up freezing my game numerous times over  resulting in plentiful quits in an attempt to rectify the bug. A clever puzzle you might think, unfortunately not only was it a genuine case of the game locking up on my run-through, but it represents an even greater concern and pressing issue as to why Calendula falters as a meta-game. Accepting as it is to leave its player in the dark as to its true nature, the game seldom communicates itself well as to whats intended to be a trick and what isnt. Coupled with the end-results whimpered climax and theres very little to signal just what weve exactly conquered, if anything.Closing Comments:Perhaps its unfortunate that Calendula comes a mere month after Pony Island took almost everyone by surprise and as such is already at a disadvantage as to its perception from the user-base. That said, theres something intriguing to gather from the way Blooming Buds so vigorously push for the game about games concept and are able to take it in numerous different directions. Ultimately, Calendula falters because of its lack of an end result and rewarding pay-off to the unsettling nature preceding it. Its a game that tries too hard to be vague and ambiguous that it ultimately leaves the content that is there to process feeling disproportionately stagnant.", "date": "February 8, 2016", "grade": 2.5}
