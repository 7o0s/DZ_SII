{"name": "Go! Go! Nippon! 2015", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=186043", "text": "Back in 2011, Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ launched in both Japanese and English. This cute little visual novel did something different from most other titles in the genre which English-speaking fans were aware of. You see, instead of engrossing players in a Japanese high school setting, dramatic sci-fi tale, or anything of that sort, it showcased an experience which many players really want to relate to. The experience in question is being able to visit Japan for the very first time. But its not simply a means to live out fantasies in a virtual setting. Surprisingly, Go! Go! Nippon! also manages to provide a great deal of helpful information to help would-be tourists if they do ever decide to head to Japan. More and more visual novel fans picked up Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ over the years, though theres no doubt that it saw a lot of extra attention once MangaGamer finally published it on Steam. In fact, it may have been because of this increased attention to an older property that developer Overdrive decided to go back and update the release with new DLC in 2015. Theres quite a lot included in the DLC to make it basically a needed purchase for anyone looking to play the game today. But before we get into whats new, its important to describe the base game itself for newcomers. Go! Go! Nippon! opens as a young man arrives in a Japanese airport. He muses that two Japanese brothers will be there to pick him up. These brothers are friends who he met online and will be treating him to a grand tour of their home country. However, the brothers never appear. Instead, there are two sisters  and in fact they were the ones he was talking to the whole time! The same plan is still set, however. Theyre both prepared to provide this foreigner a tour of Japanese hotspots. The only difference now is that romance can and will bloom between our protagonist and one of the sisters. This also adds in the potential (and reality) of fanservice segments to appear on occasion. Which characters end up finding a bit of romance depends on the players choices throughout a playthrough.Its not super obvious which characters route youre going to select, though. The reason for this is that most gameplay choices in this visual novel do not revolve around making conservation decisions. Instead, theyre based around locations to visit. For example, if you select to go to Akihabara then one of the two sisters is specifically going to hang out with you that day. As such, both characters are tied to their own destinations. After playing through the game once should give you a good idea of what places to select next time in order to guarantee a specific ending. One playthrough takes around two hours, but subsequent ones should be a fair bit quicker thanks to the skip function. Much of what makes Go! Go! Nippon! great though isnt purely the cutesy storyline of falling in love with one of your hosts in Japan. Theres the fact that the game proves a useful tool for getting started with planning for a real trip to the country. The 2015 DLC helps in large part by doubling the length of the game with additional locations like the Tokyo Skytree and immensely popular convention Comiket. This DLC also offers up a new feature in the form of Google Maps links to key locations. Although not the best implementation, as it takes you to an external browser rather than launching within the game, its a neat trick for helping folks realize the game doesnt stray too far from reality.Theres actually more to the 2015 DLC than an increase in playtime due to extra locales, of course. Returning players will also find that the artwork has been updated. Both sisters look a fair bit more modern and are animated using E-Mote. This popular animation technique ensures that the characters look dynamic and lively rather than just still sprites. Go! Go! Nippon! 2015 now also runs at 720p, and even existing CGs have been made to accommodate the increased size. The only negative to this boost in visual appeal? Unfortunately, there is still no voice acting to be found from any characters. Given all the other upgrades, it seems like something which would have made total sense. One question worth asking is why this additional effort was spent to bring attention back to Go! Go! Nippon! of all things. Sure, its not a bad little tale, but its incredibly short and not something that most players will hold dear to them. The cutesy storyline is nice, but certainly not on par with greater tales within the visual novel genre. When it comes right down to it, the rationale might simply be that because it was easy to do they did so. Luckily, those who play through 2015 and prefer the original can turn off the DLC upon next launch. It does not overwrite your copy of the original game.Closing Comments:All in all, Go! Go! Nippon! 2015 does a lot to revitalize Overdrives aging visual novel. The biggest boosts are the addition of new events, locales and Google Maps functionality. Everything else, such as a widescreen resolution and animated sprites are just icing on the cake. When it boils down to it, this is a simple visual novel that is fun thanks to how it captures that desire from many of us to visit Japan. Sure, its rather idealized, but youll still find some great tips if youre actually planning on taking a trip there soon. Although the overarching storyline sometimes gets caught up in the educational value, it also manages to warm hearts by the conclusion.", "date": "January 8, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
