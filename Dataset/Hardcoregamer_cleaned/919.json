{"name": "ABZ", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=219215", "text": "If youve stumbled upon this review, youre probably one of three types of people. You either think Abz is a weird name for a video game and want to know more about why theres a circumflex above that u. Maybe youre someone who found that crazy school of fish in the header image compelling and clicked on through. Most likely, youre looking for the answer to the one major question surrounding developer Giant Squids debut title: is Abz the underwater version of Journey we hoped it would be when it was first revealed at E3 2014? Yes. Yes it is. If this is what you needed to know before diving headfirst into Abz, then you should stop reading now. This is the type of game that youll want to go into as blind as possible in order to maximize your sense of wonder.Before diving into exactly why Abz is so captivating, lets qualify the above statement a bit. After playing through this enchanting adventure, most people will probably agree that Journey is a better game. This isnt to say that Abz isnt absolutely worth playing through multiple times, but it isnt the icon that thatgamecompanys 2012 bite-sized behemoth is. Heres the thing, though: that isnt really a knock on Giant Squids work. As someone who would readily submit Journey into a totally subjective debate over the ten best games ever, its tough to imagine any game in this style getting closer to thatgamecompanys achievement than Abz does. The combination of multiple ambiguous plot lines, mesmerizing wildlife and stunning visuals make Abz yet another example of the dominance of small developers in 2016.Dropped into the depths of the open ocean, you take the role of a mysterious diver. With no dialogue, objective indicators or initial detail of your characters motivations, Abz is absolutely one of those games (fans of explicit exposition: this is not the game for you). Exploring the colorful underwater expanse and learning as you progress are the name of the game here, and Giant Squid does an outstanding job of embracing these core tenets. For every quiet moment of beauty theres a joyous rush or a dose of tension. Whats more, if youre the type of gamer who lives for those iconic moments of beauty, those waves of speechlessness that only a well crafted scene can bring, youre in luck. Its tough to go into too much detail about the specifics of these moments without instantly removing their resonance. This would be like describing the giraffe scene in The Last of Us in detail or spelling out the big twist in last months Inside, two actions that inform readers in the worst way. In fact, Abzs name actually holds a deep meaning to the very idea of discovery. According to Giant Squid, Abz is a portmanteau of the ancient words ab, meaning ocean, and z meaning to know. A more appropriate name couldnt have been chosen, as the entire game totally takes place in an ocean of wisdom. The second someone tells you exactly whats going on, your ability to discover that information on your own disappears. To spoil any tangible details of Abz would be criminal, as the best part of the entire experience was not having the smallest clue what was coming next. Of course, this is also a video game review, so its sinful to leave out any semblance of premise, as well. In a nutshell, your character possesses a very special ability and theres some pretty dark stuff going on in the oceans depths that your power may be able to thwart. Along the way youll interact with some misunderstood wildlife, develop bonds and go to places you wouldnt imagine being deep in the ocean. Is this summary comically vague? Absolutely. Would any further narrative detail completely ruin your experience? No doubt about it.We all know that water levels are the worst, so a game whose entire gameplay hook is based around swimming could have been a disaster. Thankfully this couldnt be further from the truth, as guiding your diver through Abzs breathtaking environments feels just right. Holding the swim button lets you glide through the water with just the perfect amount of weight. Giant Squid struck a delicate balance with the weight of the diver, allowing her to glide majestically while still being dense enough to feel responsive. If youre the type of gamer that cant wrap their head around inverted stick controls, then you can certainly adjust this on one or both of the analog sticks, though non-inverted movement controls feel less elegant. Sure, there are definitely moments where your sense of direction will momentarily fade, but this is easy enough to correct that it never becomes a problem. The point is, if you want to play a game that makes swimming feel smooth, then its right here. Much like in Journey, your character has the ability to create a small tonal pulse in order to interact with the environment. This ability allows you to interact with simple puzzle elements, revive helpful underwater drones and open passages to new areas. Abz is also brimming with secrets, so if youre looking to wander off of the beaten path in order to find a new species of aquatic life or observe this ecosystem during unlimited meditiation, youre in luck. Its worth noting that there is another type of secret collectible that unlocks something pretty neat once you have them all. Now, if your next question is whether Journeys famous drop-in-drop-out multiplayer is present, theres a very good reason why the answer is no. Because Abzs entire thematic premise is based around solitude, it doesnt really make sense to have other players popping into your game. Aside from the fact that Abz is definitely its own thing and not a Journey palette-swap, this is totally logical. Despite the fact that you do make some interesting friends along the way, Abz begs you to come to grips with your solitude in the midst of an ocean of uncertainty.If youve made it this far down the page, youll have seen four screenshots whose allure has spoiled the next point completely. Abz looks amazing. Dont let its polygonal aesthetic fool you, the sheer amount of creatures and plants on screen at any given moment is stunning in motion. Being able to swim through massive schools of fish before exploring coral reefs, underwater civilizations and ancient passageways is even more stunning than it sounds. Whats more, every moment of Abz feels perfectly paced. Cacophonies of color precede desolate darkness; lifeless stretches pepper a world brimming with life. Your sense of sight isnt the only recipient of Abzs beauty, as it sports one of the best orchestral soundtracks in video games, period. Every scene seems to have the perfect background music woven in, amplifying whatever mood you happen to be in. There are certain games out there that you can put on your television and instantly mesmerize a room with, and this certainly belongs in that group. The one technical bummer here is that there are some fairly lengthy load times when you boot up your save or enter a new environment, which isnt game-breaking by any means, but its still noticable enough to break immersion. Still, when your hands are actually on the controller, Abz is both a visual and aural delight. Closing Comments:Abz is the type of wondrous palate cleanser that reminds us of the beauty of video games. When the art director of Flower and Journey, Matt Nava, left thatgamecompany to form a new studio, we could have gotten a knockoff, Mighty No. 9 version of Journey that left us shaking our heads. Instead, Abz is exactly what fans of Navas work were hoping for. A beautiful, emotional journey through some of the best looking environments on the PlayStation 4, Abz was well worth the wait. Its insane to take a step back and think about how many incredible games from small teams have dropped in the first two-thirds of 2016. Weve gotten to play The Witness, Firewatch, Superhot, Hyper Light Drifter, The Banner Saga 2, Inside and more. Adding Abz to that list feels almost as wonderful as discovering the mysteries of its ocean of wisdom.", "date": "August 2, 2016", "grade": 4.5}
