{"name": "World of Warcraft: Legion", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=225858", "text": "For all its ups and downs, World of Warcraft is still every bit the beast it was back when the competition was far less diversified. Massively multiplayer role-playing games and games in general have evolved in the more than twelve years WoW has reigned supreme yet its still the title on top. Every year fans of the genre flock back with renewed subscriptions as Blizzard continues to reinvent the game and add more content in an experience that seemingly has no end. Coming off an expansion that was hailed by many as an uncharacteristic misstep, Blizzard has something to prove. With World of Warcraft: Legion, the team set out to deliver the best expansion to date and its palpable. This one feels like a charged up frostbolt aimed at anyone determined World of Warcraft has nothing new to offer. Legion is a statement that will grasp new and lapsed players into its satisfying grind once again.Even by fantasy standards, World of Warcrafts story is massive. Going into the sixth expansion, its been weaving the tale of Alliance vs. Horde for over a decade and thats not counting the Warcraft strategy games that laid the groundwork. Legion does something that all epics aspire to by hitting the reset button gracefully. Yes, all the lore before Legion still matters and if you were a part of it itll surely enhance your experience, but those not privy to the history of Azeroth have nothing to worry about.The adventure starts out with the demonic Legion invading Azeroth from another realm once again. Some may remember the first time they tried this in Burning Crusade. Of course, this time its different because theyre being led by a traitorous Orc whose miraculously risen from the dead. His name is Guldan and he seeks out the last remnants of the cover gracing Demon Hunter Illidan the Betrayer in order to initiate a dark summon. Regardless, the heroes and villains in this journey are immediately pointed out in cinematic cutscenes that diverge from how WoWs stories are usually told. In fact, many of the important story beats in this expansion take place outside of the tired quest bubbles. Legion uses cutscenes, instancing and countless voiced characters to tell the story while youre actively participating. During the beginning of the game especially, hours will pass without the momentum being slowed. Much of your time in Legion will constitute of single-player questing in an open zone with other players. Most contemporary MMOs have shifted to this design long ago and its clear that the multiplayer parts of Legion will mainly be taking place in dungeons and raids at max level. As a single-player game it holds up as quests reach conclusions before dragging and items upgrade with regularity. If youre looking for challenging group content throughout then youll need to look elsewhere. Occasionally it becomes frustrating to share your quest objectives with other players who are also trying to defeat the same NPCs. At best youll end up facing the foe together.The new content in Legion is beautiful. From the updated character battle animations to the zone placement, it really does prove how on top the artists at Blizzard are. Each area is dense in an organic way yet doesnt feel overly stuffed with arbitrary items. All five of the new zones are unique from each other as well as the biomes pre-Legion. Its weird to be praising a decade old game for graphics, but here we are. Legion is screenshot worthy the whole way through so be ready for Alt-Z and Print Screen to occupy part of your rotation.Theres never been player choice in the themepark-style storytelling WoWs employed throughout its existence, but youll immediately be hit with options with Legion. The new continent of the Broken Isles is again separated up into five distinct zones that have their own self-contained narrative youll explore. You get to choose which zone youll head to first, second and so in comparison to the normal prearranged order. Once all areas have been completed youll end up in the same place as other players, but it goes a long way in helping you craft your own adventure and helps mix it up when rolling alts.One of the gripes that still peers its head from pre-Legion WoW are the stories taking place in dungeons. Its near impossible to find players experiencing the dungeon for the first time and no one wants to feel like the player holding the team back by reading the quest text while everyone else has pulled the first mob. Legion solves this issue by making the new five-man dungeons the culmination of world questing throughout the expansion. By the time you reach the dungeons you wont need any added exposition. What used to be a pain point has now been embraced as a strength in Legion. After completing the dungeons and reaching max level you can start queueing for harder versions. The Mythic system is one of particular interest for those who get bored after completing the toughest content. Conquering a Mythic Dungeon will net you with the appropriate gear rewards but also a Keystone. Using this Keystone on a subsequent Mythic Dungeon run will add modifiers like increased health and damage to enemies. By finishing a Mythic Plus Dungeon run youll get even better loot and be given an even stronger Keystone to use on your next challenge. This should keep veterans busy as well as provide some cool content to share with the community on sites like Twitch, YouTube, etc.Many of these new features in Legion feel like they were inspired by successful game mechanics in other popular titles outside of Blizzards library. The immediate reaction to this feels like it should be met with vitriol, but instead you accept it because it fits in. You can be disappointed that not all their ideas are original, but its hard to when its fun.One of the small additions that has made huge leaps in exploring the world in Legion is the placement of hidden loot chests. WoW has always felt vast, but often times youre only rewarded for exploring the nook and crannies with an uncommon NPC that drops a little more gold than usual. Now youll be rewarded for taking a detour down a discreet path or stumbling into a hidden cavern. Itd be difficult to award anything too game changing in these chests so they strike a smart balance by offering Artifact Weapon experience.WoWs progression still includes the tried and true gear grind but starting in the new expansion the ladder of upgrading will be devoid of one or two major items. Artifact Weapons are legendary items from the Warcraft universe and in Legion everyone will be running around wielding them. Shortly after stepping into the new zone youll be prompted to partake on a carefully crafted quest that informs and imbues these legendary weapons with sentimental value before you even attain them. It seems anti to how the game has always pushed you forward, but instead of making you wait until max level and countless raids to receive an item worth a damn, it places one in your hand from the beginning. This is a slight turnoff for the fact it breaks immersion in a major way by basically gifting all players a weapon thats supposedly one of a kind, but in the end these iconic lore pieces do much to build the sense of personal fantasy. If it becomes too much of a bother theres always the upgraded transmogrification system that allows you to use any weapon skin youve previously equipped. These Artifact Weapons will grow alongside you during your journey in Legion. They have their own unique experience bar that feels like it was pulled straight out of Final Fantasy X. The sphere grid like progression gives you some interesting choices without giving you the ability to completely gimp yourself as you work your way to level cap. At end-game youll have unlocked all the talents available but youll still be customizing your weapon with rare drops from dungeons and raids that augment existing abilities to tailor to your preferred playstyle. This distinct change will play out over the next six months or so but for now its a welcome addition.Warlords of Draenor introduced Garrisons which acted as a player housing of sorts, but in Legion theyve pulled back on that idea and instead added in Class Halls. Class Halls act as an exclusive hub where youll power up your Artifact Weapon, complete class specific quests and initiate missions. Class Halls are an upgrade over Garrisons because they are open to all players of that class. Theyre less lonely and continue to emphasize the class fantasy so apparent in this expansions goals. Missions are introduced in Legion as a response to a game wanting to stay relevant in the current age of cell phone apps. The Legion Companion App released this past week and it enables players to stay engaged in a game that already ends up occupying thoughts whether logged in or not. This app allows you to run missions and collect experience for your artifact weapon while youre away from your computer. The progression no longer stops when its time for work or social settings. These missions are mostly automated, but give the sense of leading an elite team outside the main storyline. These heroic recruits will level up and can occasionally perform a utility while questing like randomly joining to aid in battle. Each mission will generally take between two to eight hours of real world time, but there are upgrades in your class hall that take weeks to complete. For example, it takes fourteen days to unlock the ability to equip an extra legendary item. Chances are this extra item will become a necessity rather than a bonus to your gear. With no options to speed up the completion clock missions can sometimes skirt the lines of time gating with no lore or gameplay justification.You can also see World Quests pop up on the map in the Legion Companion App. These new quests open up soon after reaching max level and give you an alternative to Dungeons and Raids for gearing up your character with actual end-game gear. They replace dailies and feel much more dynamic as they change from day to day. Its nice revisiting new zones to learn more about them. The addition of quick travel by teleportation between these zones axes the possibility of spending too much time in the air via hippogryph flight paths.The whole of Legion feels tight in its execution, but lets not forget that the expansion content doesnt start for players until they reach level 100. While Legion feels new and exciting, much of the leveling process from 1-100 feels as dated as it actually is. Its hard to fault the parts of the game that were crafted years ago, but unfortunately many players will eventually be playing new characters before getting to Legion. Power leveling can be done through the dungeon system and while its generous it will still take you hours and hours to get to the good part. As an admittance, Blizzard has courteously included a level boost straight to 100 with every purchase of the new expansion. Sadly, any character boost after that will cost $60. Its certainly worth it but many players will resort to the boring grind instead of jumping straight to why they purchased in the first place. Closing Comments:Legion injects excitement into a game that for the past year has survived on being better than most. With the addition of features such as Artifact Weapons and cinematic story driven content, World of Warcrafts sixth expansion raised the bar back to where it should be while at the same time adopting ideas that will take it into the future. The first Legion Raid is set to release on September 20 and Im sure that will continue to paint the narrative as to how this expansion plays out over the next year, but for now its everything a fan could ask for.", "date": "September 14, 2016", "grade": 4.5}
