{"name": "Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=60256", "text": "Its refreshing to find a place for team pirate in a world of fair-skinned sparkle monsters and other variations of the fanged stalkers that would send Bram Stoker into a homicidal frenzy. Its also refreshing that those aforementioned pirates are as burly and barmy as Billy Bones at the Benbow, and constantly deliver bouts of baddass-ery whether on ship or land. Ubisoft managed to restore the series to the glory it found in its second release, and surpassed it in both setting and scope. With sea shanties aplenty, and rum by the barrel-full, Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag is a dream for those born several hundred years too late to experience the historical blunder for themselves.Naturally, it all begins with a shipwreck. I survive, and theres a beached stranger in need of my help. The offer of gold grabs my attention, but hardly enough to sacrifice my freebooter beliefs. I decide it best to kill him, don his familiar attire and collect the reward for the urgent delivery to Havana he spoke of mere minutes before tasting my sword. Im supposed to be a pirate after all, and isnt that what a pirate would do? In the opening sequence of Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag, the pirate concept is immediately apparent. Youre not seeking revenge on those who have wronged your family. Youre not one with an ancient code or order, either. Youre a pirate in search of some quick riches, and in just under twenty minutes this is made quite clear  all fueled with the fun of open-sea battle, island exploration and cold-blooded murder  a drastic change from the campaign-length introductory missions of Assassins Creed III.From the moment I was handed the reigns, I was greeted with a sense of freedom Id never experienced with any previous Assassins Creed title. Yes, there have been expansive cities to explore, vast countrysides to excavate, and side-missions aplenty to conquer as desired in each iteration, but never has entering the Animus offered me such a feeling of child-like wonderment. I found myself developing an obsession with delving deeper into its interesting and beguiling world as my map became a peg-board of engaging sights, activities and variable distractions  with surprising opportunity hiding around every virtual corner. At its best, Black Flag can feel much less like another episode in an annual series, and more like a spinoff that utilizes every lesson learned in constructing a gratifying experience. Even at its worst, youll still be free-running across rooftops, performing an assortment of assassinations, and collecting a good deal of upgrades throughout the story. But theres an unshakable feeling of newness accompanying every familiar act, helping to make Black Flag feel like a standalone entry rather than a sequel.At the helm of the adventure is Edward Kenway, the great, great grandfather of Connor Kenway (the leading man in Assassins Creed III). Thankfully, thats where the similarities between the two fellows end. Edward is a true pirate at heart, with riches in his eye and congeniality buried some-twelve hours deep into his long-winded storyline. The greatest praise that can be assigned to Edward is that he is nothing like Connor. Instead, he offers an identity that is as greedy as it can be charming. Yes, Edward is likely to make the list of finest Assassins Creed protagonists, but this acclaim is awarded rather unfairly. In terms of likability, Edward will forever be compared to his stodgy grandson, and as if by default achieves the rank of superiority. Theres a lot to love about his barbarous, swindling nature  or so it seems in contrast to the walking tree-stump that was Connor. It isnt for many hours into the storyline that his motives become predictable, and when allowed to escape the confines of the main quest, he makes for a grand tour-guide of the pirate life.Assassins Creed IV succeeds in capturing our attention from the very start, but thats not to say that it doesnt suffer from its own indiscretions. Theres a clumsy, disjointed story beneath the fresh coat of pirate paint, and its as coarse and corrupt as one would expect an adventure about pirates in the Caribbean to be  Captain Jack Sparrow withstanding. However, despite its intermittent extravagance and occasional set-piece heights, it so often fails to find itself within its tortuous legend, regularly proposing a wavering cast of forgettable personalities tasked with pushing the tale towards its increasingly discounted plot. While the entire first act of the narrative binds us to a life of pernicious plunder, prevarication and occasional poignancy, the latter half spirals into typical Assassins Creed territory, awkwardly shifting from one dreary, lackluster assassination to the next. The dialog throughout is mostly witty and setting-appropriate, with plenty of laughs and the occasional cringe-worthy moment. It never quite captures the heart of its premise, but it does present a charismatic few that band coherence and entertainment seamlessly.There are far fewer dull moments in Assassins Creed IV than in previous installments, although many trappings of the series have made an unfortunate return. Frustrating chase sequences? Check. Annoyingly long eavesdropping sequences? Check. Ultimately, its when it chooses not to remind you of its roots in the series holding it hostage that Black Flag truly flies its flag most wonderfully, and succeeds as a pirate simulation that is as fun as it is cagey. While the story is not an entirely bad one, and is leagues better than Connors, its simply messy in its execution. However, despite its deficiencies it delivers a fine backdrop for an otherwise perfect pirate adventure. And thats truly where Assassins Creed IV shines, as an adventure that isnt held back by its historically jaded story of Templars versus Assassins.The modern tidbits of story fumblingly glue together the many chapters required to achieve synchronization, your time at Abstergo Entertainment  a subsidiary of Abstergo Industries, the evil corporation founded by the new-age Templars  will be spent exploring office-like environments, hacking into coworkers computers through mindless mini-games and pushing the oddly structured story forward. As youre now a faceless first-person employee, these sections are less of a confusing drawback and play their part as the bridge to pirate fun quite affably  thankfully, without a Desmond in sight. Gone are the boring, dreary speeches, and in their place a humorous presentation of the modern Abstergo  while slightly campy, it serves as a delightful change of pace nonetheless.While theres certainly interesting characters to be found throughout Black Flag, its Jackdaw in all her glory that steals the show. The Jackdaw will play hostess to your pirating shenanigans, and will be your exploratory tool in populating the map with various icons. Youll dive for treasure, discover islands, and rob your sailing rivals of resources required for various upgrades in refined and ever-so exciting naval combat. After a few hours of exploring the seas, I fell in love with the wooden lass, and found myself thinking about her during more mundane moments of my day. Building an emotional attachment to an inanimate object is only unsafe when its an inflatable person  or at least thats what I tell myself as I step before her lovely wheel.Its true that the story is much of the focus, but what truly captures the eye in Black Flag is the world it takes place in  the entirety of which is artfully crafted, offering vast environments decorated with gorgeously lush foliage and bright, vibrant colors. Whales will visit the surface long-enough to steal your attention, and fire-heavy battles will become a distraction you seek to discover. Ocean water will bounce about the docks as crustaceans crawl across the sandy beaches, random rainstorms will paint the world with homespun greys, and sharp lighting compliments the splashy architecture and gorgeously vivid landscape. The world is littered with detail, both large and nearly unnoticeable  making gathering the countless collectables or encountering endless enemy ships a real treat.Each new game in the series introduces its own spin on the treasure hunt, leading players across large expanses of cityscape in search of chests, documents and various upgrades, and Black Flag is only different in that it improves the system by adding more of a purpose and value to the search. Treasure maps can now be found on corpses across the land, leading curious players to buried rewards, often containing a necessary upgrade or valuable treasure. The incentive of improved gear is enough to justify the repetitive fetch-quests, and helps to offset the mundane as you invest your time into taking on more powerful fleets in the open sea. If theres any fault to the amount of collectibles scattered about the map, is that there are more items than reasons to continue collecting them. I must have spent the better part of an hour simply collecting music-sheets without realizing how much time had passed  something I couldnt do for more than a few minutes in previous entries before becoming disinterested.Side-quests make a triumphant return, with assassination missions to tackle (delivered by those lovable carrier pigeons), couriers to capture and treasures to uncover  including underwater excavations, with long-lost shipwrecks to seek and loot. The gameplay largely remains unchanged, but has been refined quite noticeably. Everything from free-running to stealth has been streamlined, allowing for more freedom in execution. Combat returns with its prompt heavy swordplay and reliance on timing rather than skill, but despite a smaller arsenal of weapons to exploit, the improved mechanics allow for nearly effortless interactions with enemies, swiftly switching blades for bombs and pistols for swords as you dance around increasingly difficult encounters. These improved controls perform gracefully (both in single player and multiplayer) across the brilliantly designed towns and landscapes, taking full advantage of every branch or windowsill. Sure, youre still likely to stumble over passing townsfolk, and more often than desired begin climbing something you had no intention of interacting with, but at its core Black Flag is a huge improvement in both controls and their functionality.Closing Comments:", "date": "November 2, 2013", "grade": 4.5}
