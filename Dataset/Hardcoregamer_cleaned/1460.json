{"name": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=163437", "text": "In this day and age of gaming, its rare to find a developer that consistently releases not just good titles, but fantastic ones. When Harebrained Schemes first came onto the scene back in 2013, fans werent sure what the brand new studio (comprised of industry veterans, mind you) were going to do with the beloved tabletop roleplaying game Shadowrun. After all, the series has had a spotty past in the world of gaming, spawning both great games (like the SNES/Genesis entry) and just mediocre ones (like the multiplayer-centric Shadowrun for Xbox 360 and Windows).Needless to say, audiences were worried about Shadowrun Returns. Of course, that anxiety disappeared the moment the game released and then became but a fleeting memory when the even more wonderful Dragonfall expansion launched last year. Here we are now in 2015 with Hong Kong, the third Shadowrun in three years. Thats a lot of Shadowrun, right? Seeing as annual franchises often go to the well once too often, Hong Kong  despite Harebraineds now impressive resume  comes with trepidation of its own: do we really need another Shadowrun game already?Hong Kong is set in a sort of Bladerunner, tech-meets-magic dystopian future where morality is never black and white, and one can get practically anything for a price or through means of violence. Suffice to say, Shadowruns setting is a seedy one; crime, murder, betrayal, greed theyre all ripe for the picking here in Hong Kong, as they have been in all past installments of the series, except they are delivered upon with even more precision in this latest standalone endeavor. This gritty world is brought to life by the continued excellent writing that has been one of the many superb aspects of Harebraineds take on the Shadowrun universe. As a cRPG, narrative fidelity is just expected, especially given Dragonfalls success in this domain, but then also the benchmark set by wordsmith masterpieces like Pillars of Eternity. Fortunately, Hong Kong not only succeeds at meeting these lofty standards, but surpasses them, ultimately resulting in one of the most sharply written roleplaying experiences in recent memory. The writing doesnt just serve to hammer out plot twists and grand unveilings  no, it manages to build a Rolodex of characters that are every bit as likable as they are relatable. Despite this being such a futuristic world, these characters feel as alive as any seen in video games in quite some time. Their dialogue is fluid, unfolding in a way that feels uncannily natural, but its not just the cadence of the writing that manages to reel players in, its how those characters are forged. Their backstories highlight why each person is the way they are, why they think like they do, why they make the decisions that they make  and just like in real life, the various traumas they have experienced have molded them to be hardened to the core or empathetic to a fault.Dont be fooled: though at first glance this is a science fiction game, there is a real human drama that is happening beyond the surface. A drama of making hard decisions, living with the consequences of bad ones and moving forward no matter our transgressions. Its heavy, poignant stuff if you want it to be; or it can be just another sci-fi game with badass heroes and villains on a collision course for one another. Thats the beauty of Harebrained Schemes work: it can go as deep as you want it to  it can cater to the ardent Shadowrun collective or the casual Steam user just looking for a new turn-based RPG. I wont get too much into the combat mechanics here, as they remain largely unchanged from the past two entries. I say that with glowing endorsement, however, as the mechanics didnt need to change. What was laid in Returns and then iterated on in Dragonfall made for a rock solid foundation that, at this point, doesnt need modification. Knowing this, the developers instead added to the formula in subtle ways, such as the ability to enter turn-based combat mode as soon as an enemy is in view, the new Cyberware skill-tree and new Cyberweapons that can be installed into characters arms. It isnt much, but if its not broke, dont fix is the mentality here and Harebrained has the right of it to employ that very philosophy.It, in essence, gives them more time to expound upon the aspects of Hong Kongs predecessors that needed alteration. For instance, the inventory UI has been rebuilt for a more streamlined experience and easier management of items during missions  something that was shockingly amiss in Returns and Dragonfall. Most notable among the change-ups here is the Matrix system which has received nearly a complete overhaul. This was badly needed as what was available in the previous titles just never felt fully-featured or fully-realized. Having gone back to the drawing board was the right move in this instance as what we have now isnt just a re-skinned world anymore, instead feeling like a separate entity from the game world.By doing this, Harebrained has achieved the mission they set out on when starting Hong Kongs development, and that is Deckers gameplay indeed feels like dangerous legwork, investigation and hacking. Theyve done this by essentially increasing opportunities for risk and reward; the more chances players take in tackling things outside their core objectives, the more lucrative their runs will be. Contrarily, that also means the odds of getting discovered go up exponentially as well, meaning that while combat is still a substantial part of the experience, its not the only part of the Matrix experience anymore. Rounding out the changesoutside of the new crew, magic and cyberwareare some graphical changes. Because the game does not have to work on tablets any longer, the devs were able to enhance the graphical prowess, allowing for illustrated transition animatics that occur at key times in the story. Further on the presentation front, the audio has been improved as well, now incorporating dynamic music for combat that rocks and rolls with the flow of battle. Again, a small modification, but a neat one neverthelessand one that merely adds to the immersion factor.So what else is there to Shadowrun: Hong Kong? Well, skill-based character progression is back, in addition to a classless skill system that grants the opportunity to grow ones character in whatever direction thats desired. There are over 200 weapons to loot and use in combat, countless ways to dispatch enemies, plenty of tough dialogue choices that are never foreshadowed or given away to the player through some basic good choice-netural choice-bad choice dialogue wheel, and a massive world that is ripe with quests, history, and plenty to see. Closing Comments:Weve said it practically with each new Shadowrun Harebrained Schemes puts out, and well say it again for Hong Kong: this is the most definitive, comprehensive and polished version of Shadowrun on the market. It builds on the past games in subtle but smart ways, fixing what was broken, and not touching what wasnt. As a result, players are left with a magical cRPG that gives them so many options. Whether its the dialogue and story, combat, exploration, or the amount of loadout options, this is about as close as folks are going to get to a tabletop experience. The best part is, you dont have to be a Shadowrun fan to love it. If you are, though, theres just that much more to get lost in here. This is a game that transcends its name and should be spoken of in the same breath as the genres best. In years to come people will be comparing the new cRPGs to Hong Kong, because its easily a benchmark for what developers in the RPG arena should be looking at when designing their games.", "date": "August 20, 2015", "grade": 4.5}
