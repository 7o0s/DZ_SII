{"name": "Hyperdimension Neptunia: Producing Perfection", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=87019", "text": "If players are showing up for Producing Perfection to continue their usual JRPG endeavors in the wonderfully strange world of Hyprdimension Neptunia, then they are going to be sorely disappointed that this latest title in the series is anything but a roleplaying game. Forgoing those typical conventions, Producing Perfection treads new water by tackling the idol simulator genre that has been wildly popular in Japan for some time now. But sometimes first outings turn out to leave a lot to be desired; other times, theyre out-of-the-park homeruns. Producing Perfection certainly shoots for the latter, but comes up short, unfortunately putting it more so in the former category.Hyperdimension Neptunia: Producing Perfection puts players in the role of a popstar manager, helping their chosen female soar to the top of the charts and dominate the competition through stage performances and public relations. See, in the world of Producing Perfection a new idol group by the name of MOB48 (thats a reference to the actual Japanese pop sensation, AKB48) has taken the world by storm. They are growing in popularity so much that they have begun to actually take shares away from the CPUs goddesses (Neptunia, Blanc, Vert and Noire), thus resulting in our four protagonists banding together to take on the pop world themselves. Whether they each are going at it alone, or teaming up to form a super-group of their own, its all up to the player to figure out how to take them from zero to hero and win back those diverted shares.Its easy to see that Producing Perfection continues the Hyperdimension trend of presenting a ridiculous premise and allowing folks to watch how all the debauchery unfolds. Though this title in specific is in a bit of a tough spot seeing as it has a ton of dialogue and text, but clearly doesnt ever emphasis a true storyline. Thus, players will read quite a bit here, but its all rather meaningless since the overarching narrative never feels front and center, or particularly compelling at that. That being said, PP also makes very little effort to win over newcomers or those who are simply not familiar with the franchises established lore. As a result, much of the in-game chatter will totally fly over a players head if they are unfamiliar with the brand. Sure, there are tons of jokes on display for series veterans, but those moments are so shrouded in a need to have played the previous games or at least know the characters, that players who do not fall within that category are going to feel left out of most of the games inside humor. This feels like a missed opportunity for two specific reasons: 1. the game is going to have a hard time expanding itself to a larger audience; and 2. despite the super solid localization, even we found ourselves just skipping over much of the dialogue, not because we are new to the Neptunia universe, but because the dialogue between players and their pop-gal is extraneous and generally devoid of substantive value. As a result, we simply couldnt devote the effort needed to read the conversations that would routinely drone on and on for minutes on end.That being said, Producing Perfection isnt a JRPG like those that came before it, so we can only put all of our stock into its obviously neglected story. This is an idol simulation game at its heart, which means the true experience lies within the mechanics of how one goes about turning their girl into a right pop-star. The main purpose in Perfections gameplay is to increase ones fanbase; more fans translates to more shares, which in turn means the CPUs influence in Gamindustri is no longer in danger of being stripped away completely. So players first start by choosing one of the four previously mentioned CPUs to manage and then start the long trek to chart-topping songstress. From there, players have management over nearly every aspect of their chosen characters career, and must effectively direct these domains. One of these domains is the logistical, back-end side of pop-star management: scheduling and making appearances at events, media shows and other public relation endeavors. These more administrative duties are one of the primary means of promoting a CPUs presence in the music world. After that, players can then train their characters in a number of fields, like vocal fidelity in addition to dancing aptitude, and also give their idols time off from work, so as to manage their stress levels properly  a frazzled, distressed idol equates to poor performances in trainings, PR stints and even live gigs. Hence, knowing when to give a CPU some rest and relaxation is paramount to climbing the ladder of success. Over time theres an option to form super teams with other CPUs too, which further increases ones chances to surpass MOB48s fame.Ultimately, one of the primary challenges in Producing Perfection is in using ones time in the most efficient way possible. There are only a certain amount of days that players have to take their idol from nothing to out-and-out marvel. Thus, with each training, business or relaxation event devouring an entire days worth of in-game time, the player has to be aware of how to best spend their days, for needlessly wasting time can result in utter failure, which of course affects the ending one will get. Thus, dawdling around through fruitless PR or training sessions can have a profound influence on the provided time table as well as the idols capacity to function at the best possible level. Consequently, generating a game plan on how to get the most out of the story modes limited number of days is vital to the entire experience. This aspect of Producing Perfection feels fulfilling to a degree, as planning ahead and then seeing those plans fall right into alignment is a rewarding feeling.But then there are the actual stage shows themselves. Without a doubt, this is the most disappointing aspect of the game, especially considering what other idol simulators have done with in-game performances. Seeing ones hard work payoff through an engaging performance segment that has folks involved hands-on with how their idol performs, through directing their choreography and the like, can be the most satisfying aspect of any idol simulation title. Here, however, this mechanic has been stripped down to sequences that are merely observational moments, as players dont have really any direct control over their girl when theyre on stage. Instead, the developers have opted to only give players the ability to initiate stage effects (such as special light shows, confetti, pyro, etc.) and direct the camera. Sure, they can choose which stage their star will perform on, as well as which song theyll sing, but even those options are limited, only offering up a small handful of options. Thus, the very pinnacle of the gameplay experience is ultimately a colossal letdown, especially when taking into consideration what the stage performances mean, both in terms of how theyre built up in lore as well as actual trainings.Unfortunately, this is the bulk of the experience, too; plan, train, watch star performrinse, repeat Its a tiresome system that isnt made any better by the general lack of true gameplay. Thats Producings biggest problem: theres hardly any real game to play, and when it is presented to players, what they have to work with simply isnt very compelling. Initially, the game has a kind of charm about it that may keep folks firing it back up for just one more training session. But the novelty wears off quickly after its easy to see that Perfection shows its entire bag of tricks within the first hour of play. Moreover, as an idol simulator, we never felt like we were simulating much of anything other than menu navigation. There arent any hardcore numbers or stats to crunch  thanks to the leveling system that is at times random with how it allocates attribute points upon completion of a training or event  and there was never any real sense of investment in a career for our gal. By proxy, there was not a strong desire to ever see her succeed on the charts either. Sure, it was swell to see how our performances and training paid off with a chart position, but even the charting process feels aimless and like a game of total chance itself.The game isnt all bad, though. In fact, the ability to unlock costumes and mix and match various sets of clothes for stage shows is fun. There werent enough unlockable outfits, but what was there was still diverse enough to keep us compelled to switch up our girls clothes for each individual performance. And then we have the production values, which are very clearly the titles strongest aspect. Plainly put, Hyperdimension Neptunia: Producing Perfection is a great game to look at; the art is clean, character portraits are expressive, backgrounds are candy-colored and vibrant, the menu interface is slick, and the actual graphics during performances are solid enough. Moreover, the accompanying audio is a treat as well. The soundtrack is bubbly, light-hearted and for all intents and purpose form-fitting to the zany style that is Hyperdimension. As a game that is rooted in music, its nice to see Producing deliver on this front. Theres even a dual audio option, so folks wanting a subbed or dubbed experience will have their pick. The acting here is a bit all over the board, but in general, the ladies nail their parts, making for a game that can be played with the English voice-overs turned on, for once.Theres also a few sparing modes that are a bit of a saving grace, too. Outside of the core Producer Mode that we talked about, theres also Unlimited Concert and Viewer modes, the former of which is a chance to set up custom concerts, complete with back up dancers and a few more options than those presented in the main story mode, and watch the theatrics go down. The latter Viewer Mode just lets folks dress up the four CPUs and check them out from different angles. These arent going to drastically alter the experience, but their mere inclusion is a welcome addition to a game that will need help in any way it can get it in order to sell copies.Closing Comments:", "date": "June 2, 2014", "grade": 2.5}
