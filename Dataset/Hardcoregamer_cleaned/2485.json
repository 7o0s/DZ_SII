{"name": "Shelter", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=53703", "text": "Indie games have put their players in some interesting situations over the past few years. Weve stepped into the shoes of a pixelated character who sports a fez upon his head, weve played as a boy made entirely out of meat who is on a quest to save his girlfriend who is a bandage. Heck, weve even played an alien whose sole purpose in life is to run along a track and jump along to chip-tunes. Even then, if youd told me Id be playing the part of a mother badger this year, Id have a bit of trouble believing you. But thats exactly what I did while playing Might & Delights latest game, Shelter.The set-up is simple, youre a badger whos decided its time to find a new home for herself and her newly-born baby badger cubs. Thats about is. Although its hard to blame the game for its storys minimalism, because really, how interesting is the life of a badger in reality? Probably not much more than as its shown in the game. Although, thats not to say that interesting things dont happen over the course of the game. At any point on your journey, you can lose one of your cubs. Be it by predator, fire, or water. Im having trouble putting into words why, but seeing one of your cubs being washed away in a fast-running stream, or carried off by a bird of prey is a devastating experience. I never had a meaningful conversation with that cub. I never even talked to it.I suppose that weighty feeling of loss comes from the way the game asks you to take care of the cubs, minimalist as it may be. Over the course of the game, your cubs fur coat will grow faint, indicating that he/she is hungry. You then have to find a piece of food, and feed it to the hungriest cub. While this may seem like a very simple gesture to preform for the small digital cubs, their dependence on you quickly becomes apparent as a result of it. They follow you, and depend on you for all of their needs, which as a result makes you feel awful for losing one.But more than anything, its key in causing a genuine feeling of loss within the player because the game doesnt react to you losing a cub at all. You see it be carried off by a predator, hear its final shout of pain, and then its gone. Theres no penalty, its just nature. And whats shown so prominently, and effectively in Shelter is just that.
