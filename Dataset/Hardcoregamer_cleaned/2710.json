{"name": "Clan of Champions", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=16835", "text": "Swords are fun. You can smack things with them, wield two at once for ambidextrous mayhem, deflect them away with your own weapon via properly timed counter, or just let them bonk harmlessly off your shield if youre not feeling fancy. Alternately, if swords arent your thing, theres always clubs, flails, knives, spiked fists, and even weird fancy stuff that would only ever function properly in the confines of a video game. So why does Clan of Champions feel so lifeless?Clan of Champions is a game about running through a limited number of areas and hitting your opponents with whatever weapon comes to hand. Theres not much to say about the story, the combat lends itself to button mashing, the enemies are all unimaginatively humanoid, and you spend as much time trying to work around your AI teammates getting in the way as you do hitting enemies. Despite this, Clan of Champions can be oddly playable once youve accepted all its issues, but at no point will it ever be confused for a good game.At the games start you create a character, choosing from human, elf, or orc. Gender is pre-assigned by race and theres only a limited number of customization options, but once you get to the combat things open up a bit. There are three styles of fighting you can choose- sword and shield, dual wield, and close combat. Sword and shield is self-explanatory, dual wield is for two standard weapons, and close combat is for quick melee fighting. Each discipline has its own special attacks you can learn, with up to four skills in available battle, and as you gain proficiency in the combat style you can level up your favorite ones. There are also magic skills available, if you want to substitute a combat skill for a spell, because its always nice to be able to chuck a fireball across the arena.As you take on missions and level up, though, it becomes obvious that what you did on the first mission is exactly the same as what youll do in the last. The enemies get a bit tougher, and youll have a few more abilities to take them down with, but its you and a pair of AI helpers against a handful of human-shaped opponents, over and over again. Mages, orcs, skeletons, whatever. Close the distance, work the combos, break their guard, and dont let up. Level 24s impressively-armored skeleton isnt much different from level 1s people in armor, despite the skeltons fancy outfit.Normally thatd be the end of it, barring a mention of a clunky between-mission menu system, but the review copy was of the PC version on Steam, and this introduces a whole host of problems I expect wont be on the PS3 revision. The only graphics option is a choice between full screen or windowed. The mouse cursor is centered on screen no matter how many times you shoo it away to the side, even when using the controller. Its probably possible to play Clan of Champions without a controller but a run-through of the tutorial shows this to be a finger-breaking nightmare in the making. Despite using a controller on the tutorial, though, all instructions were for mouse/keyboard, leading to a whole lot of guesswork until I found a button layout, which was for a 360-styled controller. Honestly, this is the laziest PC port I think Ive ever seen.Closing Comments:", "date": "October 30, 2012", "grade": 1.5}
