{"name": "AIPD  Artificial Intelligence Police Department", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=191252", "text": "So many games have been chasing the dual joystick shooter dream since Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved released in 2005. It modernized the ancient top-down shooter genre in a confident, stylish way that was deceptively simple in design but proved nearly impossible to replicate with the same degree of craft. Even playing last years Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions, you get the sense that the developers wore the legacy of that first game heavy, like an albatross around their necks. Retro Evolved is an impossible standard to follow, yet so many developers subject themselves to it, and rarely to their benefit. Unfortunately, AIPD  Artificial Intelligence Police Department is no different. Like so many other would-be Retro Evolved usurpers, AIPD is an on-paper clone at best, sporting the look and ethos of the former game while lacking the depth and replayability that made it so great.Artificial Intelligence Police Department is a confusing name for this game. Theres no story or setup to speak of here, nothing to justify the title beyond some circuitboard patterns in the neon-infused art style. The game simply dumps first-time players unceremoniously into menus clearly designed for the Steam version of the game  even on consoles, youll need to nudge a mouse around with the left analog stick to make selections. Theres a brief how to play section of the menu to explain the basics of the game, the enemy types and so forth, but those seven static pages are all you get. It doesnt need too much explanation, though: move with the left analog stick and aim with the right, fire your main weapon with the right trigger or a collected super-weapon with the left, and use a power-up by clicking in the right stick. You can choose one main weapon and one passive ability, and theres a decent variety of each. Weapons range from gatling guns and shotguns to auto-targeting short-range lasers and long-range pulsar rifles, so as you unlock each new weapon by meeting a persistent score total, its worth playing around with all of them to get a sense of what your play style will be. The passive ship abilities are a little less interesting with most amounting to tired archetypes like more shield but a slower ship or slower weapon overheat but less shield. As well, theres local co-op for up to four players, a rare and much appreciated feature these days.If youve played Retro Evolved or any other dual joystick shooter over the last decade, youll be immediately familiar with  and a little bored by  AIPDs action. It drops your ship into a circular arena and tasks you with defeating waves of enemies as they stream in from the edges. There are a handful of different enemy types, and the game has an easy shorthand for which you should probably prioritize first: orange enemies are the grunts that more or less go about their own business; violet enemies are the heavy hitters who actively chase you down, shoot lasers at you or even teleport behind you. Theres a great effect where off-screen enemies are represented by blurred orange or violet colors, so its easy to keep track of incoming threats. Enemies will drop consumable power-ups you can store, like slowing down time or getting a temporary shield boost, and occasionally a transporter enemy slowly passes through that will drop a super-weapon if killed before it leaves. Theres an interesting system between rounds that lets you pick one of two challenges to make the next round harder, like giving certain enemy types a boost, fewer power-up drops, or forcing the player to slowly lose their score multiplier. There arent nearly enough modifiers and very few of them change the gameplay in a drastic enough way, but its interesting nonetheless.Everything about AIPD just feels too standard, too dry. The enemies are predictable and sparse. They spawn in a pattern that makes it easy to tell where theyll come from, and their behaviors arent dramatically different enough to force you to change your behavior. Its very easy to cruise the edge of the arena, lazily sweeping inward only when absolutely necessary or when a transporter rolls through the center and you want the super-weapon it carries. By necessity the game cant spawn that many enemies at a time because the perspective is too close to your ship and the arena isnt all that big; AIPDs action feels muted and a little unexciting as a result. You can ratchet up the difficulty for a more challenging experience, but its just a numbers game at that point: player health down, enemy health up, everything else stays the same. The game lets you design your own modes with unique combinations of its modifiers, and wed recommend always turning on environmental hazards because the game is easily at its most fun when an incoming asteroid field or a quickly-closing energy field forces you to change up your strategy.Closing Comments:Its easy to feel like youve seen and done everything AIPD has to offer after just a couple hours, and really, thats because you have. Its decent fun during that initial phase, but youll be wondering, what else is there? AIPD doesnt have a great answer to that question. Its absolutely gorgeous, with bright neon colors and bombastic effects, but its all style and no substance. If youre smitten by the style and want a casual dual joystick shooter to plow through in an afternoon, AIPD isnt a bad purchase. But if youre hoping for a shooter with some real meat to chew on, AIPD will leave you wanting.", "date": "February 8, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
