{"name": "Silent Hill Homecoming", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=32033", "text": "Youd think someone would nuke Silent Hill off the face of the planet by now. If ever there was a domestic target desperately in need of the glass parking lot solution, Silent Hill would be it. For years its been filled with twisted creatures vomited up from the blackest depths of the guilt-ridden victims who are drawn there. This isnt a town where happy people end up.Worse yet, its influence is spreading. The neighboring town of Shepherds Glen is looking pretty foggy these days, and skinless dogs and other horrors roam the empty streets. This comes as something as a shock to Alex Shepherd, whos just arrived home after his time in the military. His mother is a gloomy wreck, his brother is lost in Silent Hill, and his father is nowhere to be found. Its an unpleasant situation made only somewhat better by Alex, unlike previous Silent Hill protagonists, being a badass.Silent Hill: Homecomings big addition to the series is a combat engine more advanced than hit the attack button to flail at the enemy. While in the past this has served to emphasize the lead characters stature as merely human, its never been much fun. Alex has had combat experience, however, and can actually handle himself in a fight. Hes got a strong and weak attack and can work a few basic combos with them, not to mention a dodge that segues into a counter attack. The downside is that this gives enemies free reign to be faster and more brutal than ever before. Combat isnt too difficult overall so long as theres only one enemy to deal with, but facing multiple creatures at once gets a bit dicey, especially when locked on to one creature while the other attacks from off camera.Perfectly matching the fairly decent combat engine is a fairly decent story, which is a bit of a letdown, all things considered. While the Silent Hill storylines have generally taken a bit of work to figure out, theyve also packed an emotional punch that Homecoming just doesnt manage. The characters never seem to react with more than distasteful curiosity to the horrors that have overtaken their town, and decisions that should be incredibly tough to make in the later part of the game are disappointingly simple. The heart of the game should be Alexs return to his troubled family, and the hell he has to crawl through to come to terms with his relationship with them, but Homecoming never rises above a good bout of monster-smacking. Silent Hills horrors stop being horrific and instead become a just a violent freakshow with a rusty industrial aesthetic once its heart is removed. The story almost always makes sense, but its little more than summer popcorn fare.Closing Comments:", "date": "September 29, 2008", "grade": 3.0}
