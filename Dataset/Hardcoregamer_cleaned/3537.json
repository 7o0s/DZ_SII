{"name": "Resident Evil 2", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=322849", "text": "While the indie scene seems to have a strong grasp on the horror genre now, it feels like major publishers have largely turned away from it. Even Resident Evil has deviated from the genre into an action thriller over its original roots, and probably for good reason as the series has only increased in sales since it switched over. Fortunately for fans of horror, Capcom has not forgotten where the series has come from. Sure, Resident Evil 7 didnt quite meet its two predecessors in terms of revenue, but it gained traction as their venture back into the world of jump scares and tense atmosphere (at least not populated with crazed gunman) has gone over well with fans. Because of this, the Japanese developer has remade one of the best horror games ever created, and doing so has added to it to become a modern take. Thats not to say its action heavy, but instead incorporates more up to date mechanics to better convey the sense of terror and consternation to a whole new generation of players.Just as the original was, Resident Evil 2 is separated into two similar, but ultimately different campaigns. One follows the rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy, and the other Claire Redfield, a civilian heading into Raccoon City looking for her older brother. Players who grew up in the 90s and early 2000s might know the story by now, but its not exactly the same game weve come to expect. Capcom has made some significant changes to both the pacing and overall structure of the campaign on both fronts. Mind you, it still hits many of the same story beats, but they have been better implemented and more fleshed out. When the developers said they wanted this to be more of a reimagining than a direct remake, they werent kidding. Areas have been completely reworked, encounters with characters and enemies are placed in vastly different sections of the map and the general sense of atmosphere has ramped up more than it has even been. Never have I felt such a sense of dread; you think youre safe only to realize that its far from the truth. I never thought they would be able to match the original in tension and fear, but somehow they were able to outdo it. There are jump scares, but its much more than that. I dont want to get into the specifics of every little detail because it will ruin the surprises, but just know that Capcom has done imaginative work on their original creation to construct two plots that are familiar to older players, but just new enough where the flow and execution makes more sense. Mind you, it still has the campy dialogue weve all come love and seemingly unlucky random encounters, but everything about this feels bigger and better. One thing I will talk about is a mode unlocked after completing one of the campaigns, so if you want it to go in completely fresh, avoid the rest of this paragraph. This mode is called Second Run and acts as a less impressive B-Side. This just starts the second character off roughly an hour into the story and changes some items and ammunition within the world, alongside early story events. For example, Mr. X shows up while youre collecting the medallions for the first puzzle, which is far earlier than hes supposed to. This leads to far greater tension as the looming threat of a grey giant consistently stalking you around every corner becomes a realization almost from the beginning. Unfortunately, after the first hour, the game more or less merges back into the standard campaign, not really deviating in any manner outside of the ending.Outside of the story, without doubt the biggest change to Resident Evil 2 is its combat. Remember the days of tank controls and fixed camera angles? I miss them too, but unfortunately for a project most likely well into the tens of millions of dollars, those types of games dont sell like they used to. Instead, Leon and Claires journey implements the standard over the shoulder combat system weve come to expect since Resident Evil 4, just with fewer mechanics. This means that, being greenhorns to zombie slaying, Leon and Claire dont have any advanced skills such as kicking or punching the undead in the face. You wont be diving and rolling around like you did in Resident Evil 6, either. Its primarily aiming down the sights and running away as fast as you can. You are given disposable knives, which work wonders on downed zombies, because they sure like to trick you, but thats the extent to your hand-to-hand abilities. The combat in general feels fresh and inviting. Zombies take an immense amount of bullets, with even headshots only doing minimal damage, so youll have to know when to run and when to stay. The undead seem to be magnets, though, as theyre able to grab you at lengths you wouldnt think theyre capable of. Fortunately, the best part of them is that they move so erratically when they spot fresh meat. Theyre not ducking and weaving, but instead moving around and into walls, even holding their hands forward, making it harder to get a headshot. Its strategic in its approach, knowing when to take the shot and what type of weapon would be best to dispatch certain creatures. Of course its always advised to save the heavier rounds for bigger enemies, but sometimes its worth it just to avoid a struggle. Speaking of the bigger enemies, the boss fights can be engaging, but fail to deviate much from how they were twenty-one years ago. Theyre ludicrous events as weve come to expect the series as of late, but nothing more than oversized bullet sponges that dont have much strategy outside of maybe shooting specific spots on their body. Really, its the anxiety you get walking through the police department and sewer system and the puzzle solving (which has been changed significantly, but is simplified in its approach) that make Resident Evil 2 what it is.Its hard not to talk about Resident Evil 2 without mentioning the visuals as Capcom knows how to create a graphically absorbing experience. The RE Engine showed off its capabilities with Resident Evil 7, and its looking to be put forth in both Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry 5. The results are spectacular, as not only has Leon and company never looked so good, but the environmental design is top notch. Capcom has lovingly recreated the RPD and areas around and under it to a breathtaking degree, with longtime fans no doubt being giddy with glee when they see familiar areas. Its not just the visuals, either, as this is filled with remarkable sound design and subtle visual cues, be it lighting or small noises in the distance. Unfortunately, at least on PlayStation 4, there are some strange reflection issues, especially near the end of the game in the lab. It will remind you of something like image compression gone horribly wrong on anything with a reflective surface. In addition, depth of field doesnt seem to be working correctly as there are scenes where the focus is not on who it should be. Sometimes it will simply blur the face of Leon or Claire, other times it focuses on the back of another character instead for no discernible reason. Regardless, its still impressive what was accomplished with this remake, despite some of the graphical anomalies. Closing Comments:Capcom has not only recreated Resident Evil 2, but entirely redesigned it to be a bigger and more robust horror experience. The sense of dread and tension they created is unwavering throughout each of the six-hour campaigns. The choices they made only help expand upon the characters and the overall universe, along with making the gameplay a little easier for more people to survive this unforgiving world. Thats not to say theres no challenge as ammunition is scarce and zombies are plentiful, but there are means of expanding your storage and weapon effectiveness. Unfortunately, the bosses are lacking in any depth and the puzzles, while drastically changed, arent going to win any awards for their designs. Thats not to mention the console versions have some strange reflection and depth of field issues. Regardless, the atmosphere thats conveyed is some of the best youll ever find, be it thanks to the lightning techniques or the unnerving sound design. Its hard to believe that a little over five years ago we were left wondering if the beloved franchise was going down the wrong path. Considering theres little Capcom could have done to make Resident Evil 2 a better remake, capturing exactly what we love about the genre, were left exceedingly hopeful for the franchises future.", "date": "January 22, 2019", "grade": 4.5}
