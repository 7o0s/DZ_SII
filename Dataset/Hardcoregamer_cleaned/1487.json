Its story begins at the end, with you killing the last boss and getting the end credits alongside A Winner is You and then the story begins properly since your character cant remember anything. He has no idea why he just killed that dude, so the goal then becomes to unravel who you are and why youre doing what youre doing. Kurt the Righteous can jump and most importantly, teleport. Teleportation isnt something often seen in platformers, so its nice to have here.Beyond just being a cool feature, its the main means of getting around the levels and will be used in a wide variety of ways. Youll get your usual large jump challenges, but for areas where jumping isnt enough, youll use teleporting. By holding in the jump button, youll bring up a reticle showing where youll go and your angle of attack. If you time things perfectly, youll either land right on the edge of a ledge to get a tight jump completed in fewer steps or even place yourself directly above an enemy. This can be a bit riskier, but allow you to move at a faster pace through the levels.For most platformers, this might seem like the best way to beat your best times  but not here. In Roving Rogue, you have a constant ticking clock in the form of either lava coming up from beneath you or rocks crumbling from the left-hand side of the screen. Beyond just needing to get from the beginning of the stage to the end, youll want to collect three shining sets of green armor in each level too. Doing so unravels more of the story, so getting them unlocks more of the plot. Initially, your goal should just be to complete a level, but the better you get, the more suits of armor youll be able to obtain.Roving Rogue offers up a greater degree of challenge with these extra goals, but it never gets too frustrating. Since Kurts jumping is pretty spot on, most of your deaths will either be from lava or not getting the timing down of the teleport. Like aiming an egg in a Yoshis Island game, it takes a bit of practice  but its an easy skill to master. Doing so quickly will allow you to land right on top of enemies and time things to avoid projectiles. Later in the game, youll have to combine enemy-avoiding with enemy-bopping while also avoiding fireballs. These challenges will destroy you at first, but after only a few attempts, youll be able to overcome them. Roving Rogue is very much like an 8-bit platformer in that its gameplay is deceptively simple on the surface, but there are a lot of little things to learn as you go.Unfortunately, most of the games flourishes can be quickly enjoyed and there isnt a lot of depth. The teleportation mechanic is your only means of traversal and attack  so it gets old. Things change up a bit with sets of stage obstacles, but they dont do much beyond ramping up the intensity briefly. By the time things get really intense, the stage ends and youre just left wanting a little bit more. If there was an action-centric element to the game, it would probably have a bit more staying power. Enemies seem to like using arrows, so having those in your arsenal would make sense. Enemy variety is an issue as well, with about half a dozen total enemy types available. This means that the feeling of sameness extends even further.Visually, Roving Rogue nails the 16-bit art style fairly well. There are a few more flourishes evident than you would normally see then in the overworld levels, which is a bit odd. Still, it looks good even if it doesnt have a lot of color depth outside of the backgrounds. Animation is minimal, but it works in the games favor more often than not because it makes timing your movement a bit easier with a flurry of projectiles coming at you. Unfortunately, while most parts of it look fine, the overall look is still a bit bland.The chiptune soundtrack is enjoyable, but nothing that sticks with you after a play session. It is easy to hum, though, which makes it a more interactive experience. There are some beats that make you want to clap your hands to the music. The teleportation sound effects are fantastic, sounding like youre zooming through flames. That alone adds a bit of excitement, although youll be hearing that effect a lot  so its a good thing they got it right.Closing Comments:Roving Rogue is a good game that falls short of being exceptional. The game concept is executed well and it controls nicely, but the concept is a bit lacking. The teleportation-heavy gameplay changes up platforming a bit, but rarely winds up being as exciting as it should be. There are some solid ideas at work, but theyre never fleshed out enough to deliver a rewarding experience. 2D platforming fans may still want to check it out, but unlike Shovel Knight, Roving Rogue isnt so good that it becomes a must-play for everyone.", "date": "July 24, 2015", "grade": 3.0}
