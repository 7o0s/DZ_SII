{"name": "Rygar: The Battle of Argus", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=32772", "text": "This game is terrible. There is no way to be diplomatic about that. Rygar: The Battle of Argus has very few redeeming qualities. It is fundamentally a lazy effort, a brazen attempt to take advantage of the wide-eyed enthusiasm and shocking naivet that new Wii owners tend to display. All Tecmo has done with The Battle of Argus is directly port the 2002 PS2 title Rygar: The Legendary Adventure, which was a passable effort by the standards of the day and now retails for about $2.99 at your friendly local GameStop.The Wii version has Remote-specific controls (with waggle!) and gives the protagonist a fantastically stupid new design. Do not expect new bosses or levels; the new feature, Gladiator Mode, is just a typical Survival Mode. Occasionally the Wii version moves item locations and enemy spawns around a little, but otherwise this is pretty much exactly a 2002 PS2 action game.By the standards of 2009, that results in a game thats largely very dull and frustrating. A lot of features that players have come to take for granted in modern 3D action titles are simply missing, and for no clear reason. No auto-targeting, no ability to manipulate camera angles, not even the courtesy of a full health restore when you save your game. The game ends with a rush of five back-to-back boss fights that somehow manages to feel tiresome.This is not to say the game is especially difficult. Most players are going to complete it in less than ten hours. The game consists of seven worlds, where youll go through the usual routine of platforming, puzzle-solving, and monster-bashing to get to the boss (or series of Bosses) that guard the levels end. The graphics are unfortunately very dated, so only a few of the games areas (particularly Arcadia) are still interesting to look at. The larger bosses are still fairly impressive, but more mundane enemies are inexcusable.The gimmick for Rygars combat (and platforming) is the Diskarmor, which is a deadly metal cosmic yo-yo. The game gives you a tremendous variety of combos to do with it, none of which is much better than mashing A repeatedly. You can eventually switch between three different Diskarmors that affect the heros stance and combo chains, and there are good times to use all three. The best that can be said for combat otherwise is that using your guard button occasionally matters.Platforming involves using the Diskarmor to swing across gaps and climb impossible heights. Some of the games platforming segments are quite pleasant, or would be if jumping wasnt mapped to the Nunchuks Z button. Performing repeated jumps with a trigger-style button in a 3D game just feels very off-putting, and no one should ever program a game that way ever again.Rygars plot and localization are both so incredibly, amazingly bad that it almost turns into a selling point. If youre the sort of person whos memorized the original exchange between Dracula and Richter in Symphony of the Night, youll relish the chance to hear flat, wooden idiocy like Aristotle is waiting for you up ahead. He was once a powerful warrior of Hades. Diskarmors once ruined his life.Closing Comments:", "date": "February 2, 2009", "grade": 2.0}
