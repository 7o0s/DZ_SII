What youre left with is Need for Speed ProStreet, a generic racing title with the pedigree to produce excitement but with execution that inspires apathy.Though there are various jump in and play moments and the opportunity to play with your buddies, the bulk of your time with ProStreet will be spent working your way through the campaign mode. It presents various circuits you must clear to unlock more thrilling courses and a garage filled with beefier muscle cars and flashier sports cars. Initially, only three tracks are available and youll have to race on them numerous times (with differing objectives such as elimination races or time-based challenges, not to mention mirrored layouts) to access additional ones. Then the process repeats.One problem is that most of the tracks are dreadfully bland. Thats to be expected and isnt unreasonable given the focus on standard courses, but its still disappointing after the beautiful vistas previous titles in the series offered. This is made worse by the fact that even whats here doesnt feel ambitious. Buildings lack detail and even the occasional rock outcropping or other course-side object doesnt seem any more impressive than late PSX fare. Late in the game, theres more to look at as you race through those final courses, but youll have to zip through a lot of monotonous filler to get there.Races themselves feel competent, even without pretty scenery. A neat innovation here is the driver intuition concept that you can utilize while progressing through various objectives. Courses are populated by holographic arrows along certain curves that prescribe a path through the chaos. If you position yourself along the flickering arrows, youll receive assistance with cornering and speed boosts that allow you to get a leg up on your competition. The less you rely on such things (different persona you can select pre-race offer less support), the more points and prize money you receive if you place first.Points go toward leveling up your character so that those holographic arrows grow increasingly effective. Prize money can be spent on vehicle upgrades (though they make no discernible difference to your performance and the visual upgrades barely exist) or sometimes on new cars. Unfortunately, you have a lot more investment opportunities than you do funds. If you arent ridiculously frugal, youll have to race through a bunch of optional (and dull) courses just to save up enough money for  to name one example  a Corvette that will enable you to enter a certain competition. There are 32 cars in all, but too many of them arent available until purchased.Once you get those vehicles out on the courses, you then have to worry about damage. If you scuff against a railing, youll see visible dents that also affects how you drive. A few nasty bumps can wreak havoc with your ability to steer or even accelerate, dooming you to a last-place finish. Thats a neat concept in theory and is in some ways a welcome addition to the franchise, but its also irritating to be in the lead, then have a car come up behind you and push you against a railing. From that moment on, just driving in a straight line can be challenging, let alone steering through snaking turns. What could have been a pleasant innovation instead feels like an opportunity for the artificial intelligence to cheat (especially since the opposing cars dont seem to suffer from those same effects that you do).Closing Comments", "date": "November 13, 2007", "grade": 2.5}
