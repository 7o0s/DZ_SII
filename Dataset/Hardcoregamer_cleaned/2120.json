{"name": "Influent", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=86161", "text": "Learning isnt fun. Theres no two ways about it  its not something most people do leisurely  but whether you need to brush up on your Spanish to decipher details on a discount dentists billboard, or youre simply in the mood to witness one of Japans many subway molestations firsthand, theres always ample reason to add another language to your skill set. The problem is, learning a new language isnt easy. In my experience, which I admit is rather limited, nouns, verbs and adjectives tend to meld together after a sliver of chapters, forming into a giant ink blot that, according to my most recent  and completely fabricated  psychological survey, looks a lot like something I wouldnt be capable of conquering without some sort of direction.It doesnt have to be so hard, though. At least not according to Influent, the latest in language learning technology from creator Rob Howland, the Lee-proclaimed language extraordinaire of gaming. Influent is, by all accounts, a learning system. Indeed, it presents itself in game form, with all the trimmings of your typical first-person, exploration based puzzler, only instead of gears to spin and levers to pull, youll be memorizing words in an ever-expanding vocabulary list. But its that gaminess that makes Influent stand out; its where it separates itself from the pack, chiseling a place in any respectable study round.You see, school isnt always entertaining. Theres a lot of reading, writing, remembering and, usually after ingesting enough coffee to cripple a Colombian farmer, test-taking. And thats where Influent shines. Gone are the traditional methods of memorizing text; reading over material for countless nights, slowly developing an adderall dependency. Where study helps build a foundation, Influent acts as a supplementary learning tool that  through a quirky storyline involving a crazy invention and its resulting lawsuit, open exploration of a 3D apartment, and some colorfully vibrant visuals  teaches you a basic vocabulary in the language of your choice. Most importantly, though, Influent is fun. And thats something that cant be said about most educational programs.Now, youre probably wondering if Influent is right for you. Good question. First, Ill explain what Influent wont do for you, because thats where most of its value as a product is best represented. For instance, Influent isnt going to help you master any sort of fluency. For that matter, it mostly ignores things like grammar, and doesnt focus much on the finer points of each respective language in its roster. The intention of the game, and thus the end result of your playing through its story, isnt to teach sentence structure, or improve whatever conversational jabber youre struggling with. Rather, Influent sharpens an existing  or budding  skill, by forcing the memorization of a chunk of vocabulary (420 words total), and teaching proper pronunciation of said words. Its best described  by me  as an exercise tool, well suited to help those with a developing interest in any of the available languages.In terms of gameplay, youll explore an apartment littered with interactive items, both concealed in drawers, cabinets, etc., and at surface level. Your primary goal is to click on the objects to reveal a text bubble, each offering information such as spelling, pronunciation and, in some cases as with Japanese, various forms of orthography. While in its exploration alone Influent can easily improve on rough-but-established vocabularies, its the approach it takes thats most impressive.Learning to associate words with their respective object doesnt feel like a chore in Influent, stripping much of the negative stigma revolving language studies. Once you locate an object of interest, you click on it, learn its definition/proper pronunciation, and add it to your vocabulary list. After enough words have been gathered (10), youll be tested on your knowledge  or more accurately, memory  of the assorted words. While in that regard, memory (rather than skill) plays a strong role in successfully conquering Influent, it also does a fine job of forcing you to dig deep into your brain for an answer youve recently learned  and in some cases would have forgotten. It ultimately boils down to Influents visual edge, however, as absorbing information is made all the easier when walls of text are replaced with exploring a 3D environment.While the system itself is fairly simple, your bout of word masterly will eventually unlock a remote control airplane of sorts. This mode, which allows for a swifter exploration of the apartment, offers a nifty alternative to clicking things: shooting them. The controls can be somewhat finicky, but they dont take long to get used to, and in the end its a nice addition to an already engaging practice. It does make for a satisfying method in which to study words, thats for sure.Most surprising, though, is the humor. I didnt expect a game with such a strong emphasis on education to make me laugh, especially not as often as it did. With references galore, including nods to classic video games and obscure pop culture, running through the apartment on a word hunt is a breeze, and youll rarely feel the pressure of study in the process, instead learning at a natural and comfortable pace. Theres something amusing around every corner, and thats what really encouraged me to brush through the environment with a fine tooth comb  something Im quite glad I did.Before jumping into Influent, I knew it wasnt going to be a typical review. The games fun, sure, but it also has an underlying purpose that needed evaluation. Does it actually improve your vocabulary in the chosen language? Does the information stick outside of the game? The answer to both is a resounding yes. I was quite surprised at how quickly I picked up on around 75 words, gaining the ability to reference them as I walked about my own apartment. I found that Influent worked a lot like a series of virtual flash-cards, quickly reminding me of the learned words as I scoped my room for their real-world equivalent. Likewise, the pronunciation of words I thought I knew was corrected, as the games audio is loud, clear and easy to understand.Closing Comments:Its best feature, outside of any obvious educational benefits, is that Influent feels very much like a video game. Where most programs would have you sift through walls of text, painfully memorizing bits and pieces at a time, Influent has you explore, on your own terms, a game space chock-full of interactive study points. Indeed, its not the end-all educational tool, but youll walk away satisfied with your accomplishments and, in terms of vocabulary, more prepared to cross further barriers in your language of choice. For a starting price of $10, and with each additional language set costing a mere $5, theres no reason not to jump aboard, if only to tinker with its innovative approach to study. I hope to see Influent grow beyond its current state and, perhaps in future updates, become gamings Rosetta Stone.", "date": "May 28, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
