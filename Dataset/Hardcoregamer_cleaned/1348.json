{"name": "Eternal Step", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=173822", "text": "Well, this is a pleasant surprise. With the constant deluge of dastardly dreck on Steam, fishing a random unknown title from the mire typically yields, well, mixed results. This review assignment was accepted blind, with little more information than its a rogue-like. Frankly, developer Once More With Gusto undersells their title on the Steam page. What they have crafted here might be a mishmash of other titles, but it manages to come into its own. Its name is Eternal Step. Its pretty darn good.When saying its a mixture of other titles, the list of influences is a rather long one. There is the combat style of Secret of Mana, the randomly generated order of hand made rooms like The Binding of Isaac, the stamina bar and differently weighted weapons found in Dark Souls and its ilk, the permanence of specific upgrades like Rogue Legacy, and a tower to tackle like, well, a normal video game. In fact, in describing the game, it seems that there is not an original bone in its body. That is not quite true, though. The handling of loot is different, earned by killing monsters and looting chests, of course. It is not awarded until the floor is cleared, though. Taking the form of cards, the equipment type falls into three categories: weapons, armor, and shields. Weapons come in different flavors. Quick stabby-stabby dirks and slow to swing, but powerful, halberds all become available. A particular favorite would be the Master Sword. This weapon may have appeared in another series of games at some point, but its primary attribute is that it shoots little sword projectiles when the players health is full. Armor ranges from light to heavy, giving players a choice been quick stamina recovery or better protection. Finally, the shields offer a range of block and recovery stats.When the floor is cleared, the player is afforded the option of equipping the item immediately, storing it for a future attempt at the tower, or pilfering a skill from the item but keeping the currently equipped piece. The latter would destroy the new card. At the beginning of each run, the player can choose from the stored equipment. When the items are equipped, however, they are removed from storage. The item type will still be available, though. For example, there are no more Master Swords in stock. They have all been used up. If the player has enough garbage weapons on hand, the trash can be fragmented and used to create another Master Sword. Most rogue-likes tend to go the all or nothing approach, with all progress and items being lost upon failing to clear a run, This system manages to keep the risk/reward in place while keeping it accessible. Even the best loot system would mean nothing if the game its in was rubbish. That is not the case here. Exploring the tower in Eternal Step is a tense, fun time. Taking the arcade/action approach to combat, the hero knight must avoid traps and take down monsters in the quest for more loot and levels. Currently, the final boss is on the one-hundredth floor. It seems as though that may change in the future, based on the fact this information is announced when the game loads up. In combat, players have a basic attack, two changeable skills, a dodge/roll button and potions. This streamlined interface is easy to pick up and enjoy, while still providing some depth and customization. Even mapping dodge and roll turned out to not be an issue. During play, there was not one instance were one action was wanted but the other was taken. (Whether or not wrong decisions were made is an entirely different matter)Be warned, there are some nasty difficulty spikes to power through. Particularly at the boss fights. These take their inspiration from old-school design. They use set patterns, that can be counteracted in specific ways. What results is some serious trial and error. This, on its own, is fine. The problems occur when the player knows what to do, but isnt afforded the proper tools to do it well. For example, during the first boss fight, after taking down his health enough, he will go nuclear. The only way to survive this is to hide in a corner. Getting the knight to the corner in time is a severe challenge. If the player and boss are in the center of the screen, there simply isnt enough time to escape. There are two potential design solutions to this problem. One, there could be an on screen health bar for the boss so that the player knows when they are about to take enough health off to trigger this action from the boss and can plan accordingly. The second, and preferred, solution would be to add a sprint mechanic tied into the already existing stamina bar. This would keep the intended challenge in place as the player could over-extend, resulting in disaster. Just a thought.Graphics, in this case, may be a matter of taste. They do have an amateur hand drawn look them. The character and enemies do have a certain charm about them, but nothing about the look can be construed as top-end art. When playing earlier, I was thinking that the game was fun, but the graphics were pretty bad. Right when this thought crossed my mind, my wife came up behind me and stated that she liked the look of this one. Somileage may vary. Closing Comments:No one would ever accuse Once More With Gusto of putting together Eternal Step in a gaming vacuum. Most elements were taken out of other titles, customized and placed whole into this game. That does not result in a bad experience. Playing through this title feels like the result of some talented friends sitting around, talking about their dream game. While this could have resulted in a confusing gaggle of goofiness, Eternal Step is a worthy experience.", "date": "Bohn on October 25, 2015", "grade": 3.5}
