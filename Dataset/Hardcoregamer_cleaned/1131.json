{"name": "Gears of War: Ultimate Edition (PC)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=195536", "text": "Last years remaster of Gears of War was a long time coming. It brought back everything we loved from the original release, despite feeling a little old in the process. Regardless, The Coalition did a phenomenal job in redoing the visuals, recreating an experience that had fans reminiscing over the good years. With Microsofts recent dedication to the PC market, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is the first of many ports from the American giant, hopefully bringing a far more graphically intense releases to the market. While there are certain expectations when bringing a game to PC, somehow they dont seem to have been addressed here.Players will once again take control of Marcus Fenix, a former soldier who was sentenced to forty years in prison for abandoning his post  a bit of a harsh punishment, especially during such an ongoing conflict. The story revolves around this invading army called the Locust that have come from underground with unknown violent intentions. All you know is that Emergence Day sparked a massive war with the humans of Sera, and the world has been torn apart for over a decade. Marcus is accompanied with his best friend, Dominic Santiago, and eventually meets up with two other comrades: Augustus Cole and Damon Baird. The main plot primarily revolves around the group of COG soldiers to deliver an underground scanner to a location and let the bombs loose. Of course its never that simple, but its a straightforward plot that feels relatively light on its feet. Its not necessarily about the story, but more about the strong gameplay elements.The fully two-player cooperative campaign is back and more or less the same. Its about five to six hours long in length depending on which difficulty is chosen and features exciting firefights and a diverse arsenal. It has aged well, but its clearly not up to snuff with many modern AAA games. For example, combat scenarios and boss battles are straightforward with little to no puzzle elements or strategy put in. The story isnt anything to marvel at either, as theres barely any character building and no twists to be found. Because The Coalition was able to recreate the entirety of the visuals, however, it will give players some serious nostalgia. It may not be the most complex campaign, but its incredibly enjoyable to play, especially with a friend, as the core mechanics are still tight. The campaign features all five acts that the original Gears of War contained, but now also includes five chapters that were originally exclusive to the PC version. This adds about an extra hour of content, all of which could be argued is the best scenario the game has to offer, while at the same time adding some clarity to why you needed to jump on a moving train. The environments have far more vegetation to them, and it helps that the boss battle at the end Jurassic Proportions is more entertaining than any of the other boss encounters. Other than that, not a lot has changed. Theres a new Normal difficulty, but its highly advised to go straight to Hardcore as it doesnt offer much of a challenge, allowing the most casual players to breeze through. Everything you know and love from the original Gears of War is here with slight alterations that help enhance the experience in many positive ways.Unfortunately, those looking for a completely up to date Gears of War experience will have to fire up the third installment that was released four years ago. Other than some of the alterations that we listed above, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is basically a shot-for-shot remake of the original 2006 game, meaning that this is more or less the same game millions of Xbox 360 and PC owners around the world played before, just with better visuals. Because of this, a lot of the key features that made the Gears of War series grow are absent. For example, if playing the story solo, there isnt a bleed out stage for your bumbling AI to revive you. Locust enemies dont enter this state either, meaning meat shields and the patented curb stomps are no longer available (although curbing is in competitive multiplayer). Grenades can still be attached to Locust, but its not as fun as tagging someone freshly captured and kicking them into a group of enemies. Some of these gameplay elements are understandably absent as they werent developed or intended for the combat scenarios in the first game, but at least have the most up to date multiplayer possible. Its not completely without enhancements, though, as there are some small additions, such as reviving teammates while in cover and tagging enemies for others to see their location. Its more that The Coalition has streamlined a number of the elements than anything else. The missing gameplay mechanics arent even that big of a letdown; its the lack of a Horde mode thats truly disappointing. While survival modes were popular before Epic Games got to it, Gears of War 2 really put it on the map as a viable and highly addictive extension of length that wasnt necessarily competitive. Even now, so many developers are taking elements from Horde Mode and using it in their own games. This is why its even more saddening, having The Coalition not even bother implement a basic Horde Mode to build off of. There was nothing better than getting together with a group of friends in the evening and running through fifty waves of enemies only to realize that the sun was rising. Mind you, multiplayer is still highly addictive, but even for a remake, this is a step in the wrong direction.While Gears of War has a strong, albeit short campaign, one of the biggest attractions to the Ultimate Edition is its multiplayer. Like the rest of the package, this is very much the multiplayer that was in the original Gears of War, just with a few alterations. Theres nineteen multiplayer maps to be found and eight different modes. This includes all the multiplayer maps that were post-release DLC, such as Old Bones, Bullet Marsh and Raven Down. There are even maps such as Courtyard and Gold Rush that were only available for the PC version. Each map has been finely remastered, all of which look absolutely magnificent in their own way. The multiplayer modes taken from the original Gears of War include Warzone, Assassination, Annex, Execution and King of the Hill (which was originally in the PC version), with Team Deathmatch added from Gears of War 3. There are also two modification modes: Blitz and Gnasher Execution. Gnasher Execution is self-explanatory (Warzone with mandatory shotguns) while Blitz is King of the Hill but requires players to stay in the ring, and the more players in at once, the faster points are obtained. Another large aspect to the Gears of War multiplayer formula is its level-based system. As the multiplayer modes are played through, experience is gained that helps build a stronger portfolio. By leveling, access is gained to newer character skins, allowing players to show off both as an avatar and a number. Depending on what type of match is played, experience will be distributed differently. Ranked matches will give out the most experience, allowing players to grow quicker, while private and causal matches barely give out anything, especially for those on the losing side. Its something that helps players keep moving forward, giving them a reason to play over and over again, but thats not the only incentive. Multiplayer just feels plain good. Picking up the Gnasher Shotgun or Boomshot and getting into a fast paced, exciting match is one of Gears of Wars best traits. Its a game that, whether or not youre winning, youre having fun regardless. It certainly helps that the multiplayer sections was designed to run at 60 fps (so its a little easier to hit that goal), has dedicated servers and a ton of customizes to matches, such as adjusting bleed-out times, self-revives, active reloads, and various other elements. Suffice to say, theres a lot of content here to be digested.As far as controls go, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition has made the transition very well. Each action can be remapped, although the vast majority of the actions are easily accessible and correctly done for a third person cover-based shooter. Unfortunately its not all great as we come to the most disappointing aspect of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition: the quality of the PC port itself. At least from prior to release, this game has been in a regrettable state. From a performance standpoint, we were able to run the port very well maxed out, even on a few year-old hardware. Unfortunately, thats about where all positives end. The biggest and unbearable issue is that the Ultimate Edition looks closer to its 2006 counterpart thanks to poor texture streaming. The Unreal Engine 3 is well known for its pop-in issues, but the Ultimate Edition takes it to a whole new level. It not only takes forever for textures to stream in, but most of the time looking at a model, it will go from its highest resolution texture, revert down to its lowest and then move up back through its stages. This wasnt an isolated incident as we ran into this issue all throughout the campaign, most notably the environments, but if you aim down the sight you can see enemy models have a hard time catching up, too. It could be that there will a day one patch that aids to this or updated driver support, but as it stands, the game we played through had severe issues that makes this an ugly mess. Closing Comments:Gears of War: Ultimate Edition for PC is plagued with a number of issues that vastly damage the experience. The core gameplay remains untouched and the campaign, while dated, can still be a lot of fun with friends. The keyboard and mouse controls are well implemented and they can be remapped if you dont like how theyre structured. Finally, despite having a short campaign, theres still a fair amount to shuffle through, so long as you plan to explore the expansive online components. Unfortunately, all of that is moot if the visuals arent working correctly. Had things gone as planned and the PC port lived up to even the Xbox One version, then we could have had the start of something magical on our hands. Theres still a plethora of content here to enjoy if you somehow are able to look past this crippling technical issue, but unfortunately it seems the transition to the open platform has failed to live up to certain expectations.", "date": "March 1, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
