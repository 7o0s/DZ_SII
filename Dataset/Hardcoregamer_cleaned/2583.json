{"name": "Resident Evil Revelations (HD)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=40891", "text": "When Resident Evil: Revelations came out last year, it was overshadowed by the impending release of console big brother, Resident Evil 6. While Resident Evil 6 ended up being criticized for a multitude of issues and is still routinely ravaged today, Revelations was praised as a refreshing return to form for a franchise that had long strayed from its roots. Even though the adoption rate of the 3DS has significantly increased since the games original release, Capcom is trying to right the wrongs of 6 by treating Resident Evil: Revelations like the real successor of the franchise. While its not the revelation (pun most definitely intended) its been built up to be, its clear from Jills first steps that this is the definitive version of a refreshing throwback.As I originally experienced Revelations before 6 was released, its amazing how straightforward and less convoluted the plot seems now by comparison. A grotesque mystery, Revelations concerns fallen futuristic city, Terragrigia, abandoned luxury ocean-liner, the SS Queen Zenobia and a terrorist group called II Vetro. While the spooky ship is seemingly unrelated to the awful attacks II Vetro carried out in Terragrigia, things are clearly not what they seem when Jill Valentine and Parker Luciani board it in search of Chris Redfield only to discover a dummy doppelgnger and a Conan OBrien impersonator lurking the corridors.Unfortunately, one of the biggest things that plagued the original game remains and proves more annoying in the console format. The tight corridors of an abandoned ship are the perfect setting for an old-fashioned Resident Evil experience, but a misguided decision was made to frequently break away from them to have action packed levels with Chris or Parker. A complete departure from the serious tone of the ship levels, these feature shotguns, machine guns and horrendously groan-inducing lines from Jessica about how pretty and ignored she is. Theyre solid action pieces that are fun to play through, but in a game that so perfectly captures old-school terror, they serve as a constant distraction that kills the disquieting atmosphere.Of course, theyre also part of an underlying problem with the console adaption, which is that the bite-sized episodic flow doesnt transfer well. Instead of simply having a huge map to explore, the game is comprised of over ten small levels in multiple areas. After reaching the next level, youre presented with a Previously in Resident Evil: Revelations video which is unnecessary for those gaming at home with a longer attention-span. If the game cut out all the action levels and doubled the map size of the ship, this could have easily ranked amongst the top the series has to offer.Alas, aside from qualms that have been simmering in my psyche for over a year, Revelations remains a strong game that plays better than ever on consoles. Gone is the need for combined camera/movement or the unwieldily behemoth that is the Circle Pad Pro, instead replaced with intuitive controls that make combat easier, scanning quicker and shooting feel more natural with triggers. One of the best looking games on the 3DS to this day, Revelations looks noticeably better here in HD. Almost everything is smooth as butter, with environment textures more defined and easier to make-out. Cutscenes are worthy of the latest AAA console release and character models see the most noticeable improvement, no longer full of jaggies; Jessicas sweet ass is actually round and Raymond Vesters patented orange Pompadour is slightly less shockingly horrific.As youre no longer huddled over a tiny screen with likely distractions and outside light, sections in the ship are more frightening  especially if youre playing on a large TV in darkness with surround sound. Lighting effects have been improved and the disgusting mutated appendages of your enemies ooze and pulsate in ways you couldnt see on the 3DS. Theres a loss in depth and the lack of a constant map on a second screen is unfortunate, but those loses pale in comparison to whats gained here. Besides the graphical overhaul, new features are included such as Infernal Mode, an improved Raid Mode and a new enemy in the Wall Blister. Infernal Mode is certainly the mode youll want to play the game on if you beat the original and didnt get completely rocked, as it adds a ton of enemies, changes object location and make things ever so punishing. Neither that nor the improved Raid Mode is worth buying the game again for, but they are fun diversions for seasoned fans of the original.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 19, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
