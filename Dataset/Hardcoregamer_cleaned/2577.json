{"name": "The Starship Damrey", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=41750", "text": "By this point it should be obvious that, if youre going into space, it might be best to take a full battle squadron rather than a single ship. Every single time something goes horribly wrong, resulting in a lonely scramble for survival in the dark reaches between stars. The Starship Damrey is yet another in a long line of starships where something went horribly wrong, leaving you to work your way towards the revelations hidden in its heart.There are no instructions to Damrey, and it tosses you into its world unprepared. After a few logic problems that get the computer up and running, however, it settles down into a game about controlling a robot through the ships two levels, solving a small handful of environmental problems while working out what caused the crews unfortunate fate. Theres no obvious reason for the lack of instructions, though, because there are no mysteries in the scenario or Damreys control scheme that would warrant it. It takes all of a ten seconds to sort out the robots abilities, and the fun of discovering new and unexpected surprises with an upgrade system is completely absent. Its a bit disingenuous to present the gameplay as a mystery to unravel when, really, its just too simple to need explanation.So the robot trundles its way through the ship, clearing paths by solving obvious puzzles, exterminating the occasional space leech, finding key cards to open previously locked doors, and eventually finishing the story after a couple of short, painless hours. The Starship Damrey isnt a bad game, but its not a good one either. It leaves behind almost no impression of having played, but its also not a terrible way to use the short time it takes to complete.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 24, 2013", "grade": 2.5}
