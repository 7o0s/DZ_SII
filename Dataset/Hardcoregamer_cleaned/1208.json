{"name": "Gemini: Heroes Reborn", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=188125", "text": "Fans of the show Heroes were thrilled to see the show return as a mini-series following the events of the terrorist attack in Odessa, Texas. Being the ones put to blame, Evos, or evolved humans, are hunted down and killed. Gemini: Heroes Reborn takes place before the events of the show and follows the story of Cassandra, Dahlias younger sister, who goes back to a facility called the Quarry in order to find out the missing details of her past and of her parents. She is led there by her friend Alex who claims that he can give her the files on her family. Under the impression that the location has long been abandoned, they begin making their way inside only to find out that it isnt and Alex gets taken away. With a pair of smart glasses given to you by Alex, he is able to communicate with you and lead you to him, only to find out that he has lied to you and led you into the hands of Trevor Mason, director of the Quarry.As you search for Alex, you are granted the power of telekinesis as well as the power to travel through time, (between 2008 before the Quarry was destroyed and 2014, the present day and destroyed Quarry). You must use these powers to have the upper hand on Trevor as he forces you to make a deal with him in exchange for the Gemini Formula, a serum that he will use to experiment on evolved children and push the limits of their power, which, of course, you dont know about. The game itself is fun to play as you are given the opportunity to switch between time lapses with ease as well as attack your enemies with your powers, but its lacking other than that.The game goes about using levels and in each level, you are given a waypoint that you need to reach which can only be done by switching between time lapses and using your telekinesis to attack your enemies. Aside from that, there isnt much else that you do. Of course, as youre playing through the game, you encounter significant events that further the plot but the characters always seem to be emotionless. Dialogue and character expressions make, what you would think to be something important, seem as though it doesnt really matter. This also ties in with the fact that you need prior knowledge in order to understand most if not all of the references in the game. This doesnt necessarily make it bad, but it adds to the frustration of trying to understand the underlying plot if youve never seen either Heroes or Heroes Reborn.Even with these problems, Gemini is a lot of fun. There are only so many games where you can slow down time and catch bullets in the air only to revert it back to the person who shot it. Even fewer where you can jump in between time lapses and take your enemies with you in order to isolate them. Youre given a lot of different ways to attack your enemies from picking up items and throwing them to picking up your enemy and tossing them into danger. You have the opportunity to see the other time lapse while in the other in order to sneak up behind your enemies or to plan out their demise. These styles get a little repetitive and you begin running out of ideas relatively quickly, but it is fun while it lasts. Closing Comments:Gemini: Heroes Reborn in itself is an enjoyable superhero simulator, but it gets by as a Heroes game in title and references only and is far too long winded and repetitive to be considered much else. While mindlessly fun for a while, it loses itself in the time puzzles and attack sequences just to get a key to unlock the next area and do it all over again. With Heroes Reborn not being renewed for a second series, though, it would come as no surprise if Phosphor games continues to release these games to continue the series and if they do, they would succeed more as mobile games rather than console and PC games.", "date": "January 20, 2016", "grade": 2.5}
