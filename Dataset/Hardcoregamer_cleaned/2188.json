{"name": "RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=81361", "text": "Plenty thrill-seekers, daredevils and adrenaline junkies love roller coasters. Theyre often massive, dangerous and terrifying contraptions. And while I am not one of those people, theres an obvious chord they strike that, for quite some time, didnt have a video game counterpart that could match such intensity; until RollerCoaster Tycoon was released in 1999, that is. For those unfamiliar, RollerCoaster Tycoon gave players more than just a wild ride, it offered them an inside look on how to manage the day-to-day operations of a theme park. It was a great title and rated well by many. Now, we jump ahead to 2014 and, although the series has grown to sky-screaming heights, its latest entry RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile is more of a kiddie area in a discount carnival.The game, available for iOS devices, is better suited for children who are already bored of whatever games they play on mommys iPad. If youve ever played the original games and then started playing this one youd definitely think very little of Ataris attempt to bring the series to mobile. The best way to describe RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile is to label it as another generic tap game  leaps and bounds from its initial intricate and strategically exhilarating entriesYou build your park in what limited area available, and with whatever items possible, and just wait for money to stack up before you tap the location and put it all in your pocket. Put a pizza place up and tap for money. Put an ice cream shop up and tap for money. Put a balloon stand up and you guessed it, tap for money. Youre rewarded with additional rides, vendors and businesses, but theres essentially no benefit to popularizing your park beyond a faster-paced income. Now, you might be asking, well, isnt that how its always been, to create the best theme park? No, actually, in previous titles you were charged with managing the entire facility  not just its construction. You were tasked with a myriad of activities, such as hiring security, fixing malfunctions and ensuring guest happiness. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile, mostly everyone is always happy besides the player.Additionally, guests are no longer called guests. Theyre not called patrons or customers, either. Instead, park visitors are called peeps, because evidently theyre all dollar-store Easter marshmallow snacks. This change in name isnt a huge one, but its quite unprofessional. You dont see too many suits shaking hands and calling each other peeps during operations board meetings, nor do you hear Six Flags or Disneyland employees tossing the word around their respective parks.Despite their strange title, peeps are quite misguided. While mostly full of sunshine and joy, theyll occasionally complain about trivial things such as a lack of rides for children. The problem, peeps, is that youre very limited in what can be built, and since theres no guest relations or security to direct those disgruntled visitors to, youre left to deal with their pleas as you tap, tap and tap till boredom sets in. If you can move past the ridiculous omissions and simply want to create the biggest, baddest roller coaster, youre out of luck. Its physically out of your control. The height of a coaster can only go so far up before the game forces you to start building its descent. A game with this dimensional view cant allow the ride to go as high as you want because you simply cant scroll up. Youll never be able to create anything as scary as Kingda Ka or as futuristic as Epcot. Scrolling up on the screen brings you to what would be behind the ride on ground level. If you dont want a park thats best suited for children, too bad. Everything has a toony build that looks as if it were ripped from a Nick Jr. cartoon. Even when you do manage to toss in an extreme attraction or two, those silly peeps will simply complain and complain until you childize your park once more. The music, too, is worse than hearing four Jersey Boys songs every hour on the hour. Its just the same jingle mixed with a single rock riff that repeats ad nauseam. For a game that built its reputation on its wide range of customization, its surprisingly limited in all aspects  even its audio, which wouldnt have required much finesse to become more than a reminder that mute exists. Sure, you can move things where you want, but its no fun if you have to constantly buy land. At least theres a mini game to help you earn some money. For what RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile is, its passable. However, its an app based on a popular and much beloved series, and with that in mind its awful. Some highlights include a wide variety of decorations that can be unlocked as you level, and speedy load times across the map. Unfortunately, thats not quite enough to rescue this game from mediocrity. Closing Comments: At $2.99, RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile isnt a smart purchase, especially considering its an extension of a series as robust as RollerCoaster Tycoon. There are plenty of similar tapping games out there that are absolutely free. It seems theyve followed through on a particularly random peep quote, its time to make some money. The tutorial, which is a lady that vanishes shortly after the game begins, is useless, the characters are unintelligible, and theres little to offer outside of what you see here. RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile is no more than a cheap attempt to milk hardcore fans. With that said, its still a fine option for children or those interested in a bare-bones RollerCoaster Tycoon experience.
