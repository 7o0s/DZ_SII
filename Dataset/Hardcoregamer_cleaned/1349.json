{"name": "Tales of Zestiria", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=173043", "text": "If JRPGs were soft drinks, the ever-popular Tales series would easily fit the bill of the Diet Coke: reasonably balanced, not too indulgent and one best enjoyed in compartmented doses. Ive never personally identified as much with Bandai Namcos go-to fan-pleaser as I have other eastern-developed franchises, be it the character-led resonance of Persona (akin to a Dr Pepper if youre curious) or Xenosagas (Irn-Bru right there) lofty ambition. Yet, theres something whispering away to me from out the confines; whether its the jubilant aesthetic of Symphonia or Xilias gamble with setting  of which I respect  if I know Im not staying, I can at least damn well [try to] enjoy my time and cut right into the meat of Tales appeal, and by extension, its first outing onto current-generation consoles.Thats not saying Tales of Zestiria is entirely lacking outside its signature real-time tactics and combat system, but it wouldnt be a stretch to proclaim you wont come out of this speaking gospel of Zestirias rather expendable plot, and in effect, its character roster. You play as Sorey, a happy-go-lucky young man  and potential nominee for worst running animation in a video game  tasked withyouve guessed itsaving the World as well as fixing a once healthy co-existent relationship between mankind and a race of invisible spirits called Seraphim. Oh, and something about evil manifesting through negative emotions and dwindled loss of faith. The story isnt teased or otherwise prolonged anymore than whats necessary, so come the turn of the opening hour youre left to get on with it and explore the grand open-world  a feature making its long overdue debut in the series  before you.Progression, in as much the World of Glenwood, feels familiarly acute to the way early 3D Zeldas cleverly tackled the issue by way of exploration of which was interconnected by cleverly-disguised corridor sections and regions that could pertain to mini-dungeons. Unfortunately, given were comparing two games from three (at the most extreme) generations apart, Zestirias World looks, acts and feels untreated. For all the intriguing twists and turns that tease and allude to greater discoveries, a lot of Glenwoods visuals  or at least that which isnt blocked off by invisible walls and carefully-placed foliage  lack in anything other than a polished loft of color. Even with PS4s enhanced capabilities, an added sharpness doesnt completely help revitalise an otherwise deprived setting. Theres barely a concern to utter performance wise, though some transitions from in-game cutscene back to gameplay can freeze if for a fragment and building textures can look as clean as a splotch of porridge. Even with these minor hiccups quickly fading from memory, most of Zestirias open environments, at worst, feel relegated to well-curved geometry. Fortunately the enclosed towns/villages dotted about are a lot more invested and focused, if not buzzing with life (despite what the stock sound effects of bustling crowds, will tell you). The obvious linearity and cut-off points of certain streets or paths seldom hide from view but its the aesthetics that allow some narrative tone and context in situations of either great peril or welcome relief, to bloom. Such is the shame then that the supposed dungeons here are so woefully lacking, each of these such segments that play towards that treasured end-goal dont quite meet expectations. Be it the myriad of ninety-degree corners, square-shaped rooms or the general lack of atmosphere, its sterile familiarity leaves the genuine mystery and possible anxiety of these locales to gradually wane. Its not unlike Tales games to have a splintered layout with such stark differences in presentation, but if theres one aspect that at least helps lift the open-World from off its lacklustre porch, its definitely the combat. A signature and significant staple of the franchise, but Zestirias approach goes further and is immediately compelling.As always, pitting yourself against foes  Hellion or no Hellion, in this case  lands you in a sealed-off designation of the field of battle the moment you and enemy alike make contact. Rather than taking turns, players actions function in real-time with combat focusing on what are dubbed Artes. The aim is to build up consecutive combos whilst keeping a tactical eye on how and where you position ones self through either offensive or defensive measures. Your close-net allies can be given orders as to how to approach a battle and can even be switched out for further advantage. But one of the new mechanics to feature  and a notable inclusion more so  is the Armatization moves that allow human and seraphim to fuse into a hybrid, bringing increased strength as well as improved skills. In-game instructions insist these abilities, like everything else, can only be used upon meeting certain requirements (filling up its designated bar). But rather unlike the meters governing the amount of times you can attack, or indeed the one illustrating your HP, Armatizations are often devoid of restriction and consequence for overuse is non-existent. That said, such use  which itself can turn into an addiction  adds some much-needed liveliness and enjoyment mid-battle and can turn a conservatively calculating affair into a frenzied hack-and-slash stunner. Not that the conventional rock-paper-scissors formality doesnt itself delve into a little madness on the side, but regular combat finds itself (again) tainted by jarring camera-work and characters sandwiching themselves between yourself and the enemy youre targeting, the urge to up the ante is never too far away. But when it works  when the pieces to the puzzle all fit  the glee of racking up combos, flashy visuals notwithstanding, are unparalleled. Whats more, the grading system that you get by way of the result screen only acts as a means to improve and push to get better and more efficient with the system in place. You wont find anything as complex or as extravagant from designated hack-and-slash monoliths like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry sure, but Zestiria doesnt try to play by anothers rules, nor does the more empathetic treatment of player choice (and all the mistakes it might incur as a result) permeate some miscarriage of fairness.Those who delve into customizing both looks and load-out will find an abundance of combinations and chains that cover anything from strength to defense to magic to the amount of health-providing snacks that can be made on the fly. Tutorials are sometimes a little too wordy and menus arent always well designed  least of all to those new to the series  but the fun, like so many other games, lies with experimenting and finding a way to counter the risks that come your way. I reiterate, punishment is rarely severe and Zestirias emphasis on the joy of combat means you wont find yourself relying on statistical chance as much as you will on careful timing and co-ordination. Even the result-screen chatter that often accompanies the end of battle can be modestly humorous, or at the very least welcome to the scenario as a whole. As are the return of skits involving Zestirias cast, be it concerns on serious matters pertaining to the plot or more left-field discussions as to, say, which seraphims are the better cooks. Such light-hearted filler  because at the end of the day, its a little tide-you-over until the next pivotal moment  is indeed a neat touch, yet this sadly is as close to any means of character development not confined to the dreaded cliches of modern day anime characters. Im not the most obsessive when it comes to Japanese culture, but I know enough to identify what and what isnt a common personality trope. And believe me, some characters are personality #132A incarnate. Whats worse is that Zestiria at times forces this ,lever self-parody by way of a kind of subtle wink and telling the player: yeah this is so clicheam I right guys, am I right?That uncalled for irony only leaves cutscenes feeling even more stiff and artificial; all this despite the fact characters barely illustrate any body language to begin with  physical movement depriving the decent voice work from feeling anything but that, voices. Some small jabs and moments of witty banter help do alleviate some of the stress of the grand spectacle and they at least offer alternating characters a reason to do something other than stand like theyve utterly zoned out. Yes, JRPG characters arent all lively firecrackers in the talking-cutscene department, but Zestirias spacious surroundings consequently generate a kind of vacuous plane to a situation that might, just might, in another time been so much more convincing. Thus, this is perhaps where Zestirias true flaw unfolds before us; for all its momentary lapses back towards concentration, to a realm of thoughtful gameplay and immersing combat that succeeds in feeling fleshed out and expanded upon, other components feel lost in a former era, reliant on old tricks to see through, rather than achieve some greater means or purpose. Closing Comments:By no means is Tales of Zestiria bottom of the pile, yet as far as all around quality goes  by which the many cogs keep this latest entry circulating; moving with swift, relevant engagement  Zestiria is perhaps the point wherein Bandai Namco really do have a franchise on one hell of a tipping point. If future installments can banish this belief that elements like characters, progression and World-building are some kind of temporary prop, the series could become relevant again. Theres salvation in the combat, especially when it makes the player feel  if briefly  like theyve mastered the art[es] of strategy, and gameplay will indeed trump anything plot or visuals may throw. But these grand adventure-types have always been about more than just the momentary, short-term victory, havent they?", "date": "October 24, 2015", "grade": 3.0}
