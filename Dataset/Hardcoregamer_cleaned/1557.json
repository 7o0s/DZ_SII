If reviews like this required no more than a literal mere sentence, this is precisely what a game like Shadow Warrior 3  developer Flying Wild Hogs third outing for what was originally a reboot of 3D Realms late-90s shooter  is best-suited to don. But like most things, its never that simple. An ironic circumstance given this years streamlined, back-to-basics, roughly-five hour romp that seldom stands still for long. And thats before you even factor in the ample number of arena combat encounter that have you filling ones screen with demonic gore and blown-off limbs alike. For those coming straight from 2016s Shadow Warrior 2, the differences are going to be blatant and divisive in regards to whats in store for players coming in. Or rather: whats not in store.Gone are the semi-open environments, the loot-based scavenging of weapons and accompanying perks, so too the co-op (though its a given many may see the latters absence as not all that damaging). Upgrading of ones weapons and skills remain, but if were talking solely about everything outside of the core FPS gameplay, its surprising just how different Shadow Warrior 3 is. It may carry through that same excess  and crude humor alike  of prior titles and while different, its easy to take an initial glance at the series third (or fourth if were counting the original) outing and fear Flying Wild Hog have gone further than cutting off the figurative fat. A fear made even more relevant and nagging via that aforementioned one-and-done play-time of around five hours to see end credits. The only semblance of replayability realistically being how different a challenge the Hard mode is to its respective Medium. Though in all honesty, this is one of the rare occasions where one would strongly encourage that even complete newcomers pick Hard by default given how relatively cakewalk the challenge at Medium feels in the long run.But its the progression and manner at which the adventure unravels that will grab early attention. To say this game is far more linear in this respect, while understated, doesnt necessarily equate to a negative. True, Shadow Warrior 3 this time confides in the simple objective of getting from A to B, with combat encounters sprinkled about to break up the pace from time to time. Thus, players are required to use a mix of Lo Wangs abilities  double-jump, dashing, grappling onto parts of the environment  to move forward. There are optional hidden paths tucked away, wherein an upgrade point is usually stashed away, but for the most part the path forward is relatively simple without much divergence. That doesnt mean players wont fall victim presuming a part of the environment is interactive  be it in the pursuit of hidden collectibles or otherwise  and dying as a result, but these accidental moments can be chalked up more to a players momentary curiosity, rather than a fault of the level design.Speaking of immediate impressions, by far the most striking aspect of the environments is in the art direction this time. Specifically how much emphasis there is this time on color  levels offering a surprising amount of vibrancy which, in hindsight, proves to be a nicely-fitting counter-balance to whats predominantly an overly-violent romp of blasting one wave of enemies after the next. As minor a detail this may be to everyone save myself, I have to give Flying Wild Hog credit for so cleverly shifting the main color palette of their levels from red to green and finally to blue during the latter stages. Red-green-blue: RGB. An intended, aesthetic-tinged joke perhaps  more subtle than anything that comes out of protagonist Lo Wangs mouth, at least? Who knows. But so far as gameplay integration goes, the best parts of traversal come when players are eventually required to use a combination of some or even all abilities at once above an infinite drop, just to reach the next vital part. Instances that, for example, require you to shoot a series of vines mid-air to enable a viable latching-on point for your grapple hook. Or swapping between jumping over/around an instant-death obstruction and shooting others to pieces, all while making sure to land back on a platform descending down a slope.The solutions to such segments may all be singular in what the game wants you to do and admittedly Shadow Warrior 3 isnt immune from throwing a deliberately-scripted moment into the mix. Moments that have time slow down to a crawl  thus mitigating much of the risk that comes as a result of the fast and frantic means of platforming. But thankfully, such implementation is few in number that its the former deductive sections that shine as the better examples of traversal. Then of course we get to the combat, undoubtedly Shadow Warrior 3s beating heart. Moments that may well over-indulge in being flashy, substantial in terms of sheer volume and similarly violent on top (even at its most tame), but Flying Wild Hog have made sure to inject strategy to stop the game from feeling mindless in its first-person action.One of the brighter spots of the combat lies in the integration of what are dubbed Finisher Moves. Sharing a similar sentiment to that of the Glory Kills from 2016s DOOM (that comparison was going to show up one way or another), the game actively encourages players to go about combat aggressively, but not without keeping a close eye on where ammo and health drops are respawned about a locale. Upon each enemy kill, players can also nab little yellow droplets that fill a meter corresponding to said Finisher Moves. The twist here, though, is that certain enemies require a certain number of charges to take them out. That may sound irrelevant at first, but when you factor in that certain enemies drop powerful temporary items dubbed Gore Tools, combat in Shadow Warrior 3 briefly turns into more of a strategic managing of ones Finisher meter. A sense of management that also factors in ones health; successfully landing a Finisher refilling ones HP regardless of the enemy you target.The conundrum then  and one that spices things up in the heat of the moment  is whether or not you hold back on expending energy for the sake of health, or hold off in the hopes of acquiring a desired Gore Tool. Tools that, not least for later enemies, are ridiculously over-powered and unrelenting in spectacle, even in the context of the normal scenarios. Temporary weapons that can have you mow through enemies in mere seconds. And yet, even if you put the Finisher Move mechanic to one side  ditto the optional traps that appear from time to time, that you can spring on baited hordes  and concentrate solely on the split-second, moment-to-moment fray that most combat sections play out in, Shadow Warrior 3 is still a ridiculous amount of fun not just to control, but in simply spectating. Be it the fifth instance or the fiftieth instance of a screen full of foes, bullet-fire and many a particle effect. It all may look like dumb, shallow style without substance, but its that unhinged delivery that Flying Wild Hog are so clearly committed to and the game is all the better because of it.Admittedly the further you progress into the campaign, the notion of the game relegated to just spawning everything at you until its deemed time to move on can get repetitive. Not least when little else is there to vary up the mere objective of kill everything. But the consolation to even this very repetition is in how fluid and relatively easy it is to sprint/bounce/wall-run ones way around the allotted arenas. Clearly this is a game that is intending to make you feel, even from the out-set, over-powered but Shadow Warrior 3 most importantly will still punish those that stick in the same place for too long. Even if that notion of punishment lies in simply spawning enemies off-screen or have them run rings around you until theyre dead.Such has been the focus on gameplay and even its presentation from a visual and artistic standpoint  and rightly so  that its no surprise that even here the notion of Shadow Warrior 3 as a narrative, a plot it anchors to its linear level-by-level progression, is easily the weakest element. An element that, looking back, doesnt linger all that well in the memory. Much like its gameplay, one thats so desperate to hurry between one cobbled-together set-up after another, that any impact to what one is actually doing becomes an afterthought. Then theres Lo Wang himself and the particular brand of humor shall we say; if you werent a fan of it in prior games, Shadow Warrior 3 wont convince you to change your mind here. Even so, its disappointing at just how unfunny most of the writing actually ends up being  not helped by the incessant pop culture references that spring up along the way. The handful of genuine chuckles the game does manage, coming almost unintentionally or just through other pieces of dialogue not pertaining to the series love for innuendo.Closing Comments:For some, what you make of Shadow Warrior 3 may well be influenced by the comparisons one draws from the prior 2016 entrant. While all parties will unilaterally agree Flying Wild Hogs third outing in the series feels more stripped back and to the point than its predecessors  least on the surface  feelings thereafter will no doubt be split. Some will deduce this years offering lacks what made 2016s title a novel but compelling shooter to play in repeated session. For others, myself included, that notion of being stripped back by no means signals a negative. But few will disagree that developer Flying Wild Hog have gone about this in as unapologetic and as indulgently-confident a manner as one can get. That attitude may only get you so far in admiration, so its thanks to a mixture of smart strategic additions to its combat formula, as well as a welcome care to its artistic design, where the series third entrant will garner a majority favor. It may not be reinventing the wheel in any drastic means, but Shadow Warrior 3s warranted excess and lovably chaotic flow is one youll easily get lost in and perhaps never want to get out of.", "date": "February 28, 2022", "grade": 4.0}
