{"name": "Terror of Hemasaurus", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=428867", "text": "The end of humanity most likely started with the discovery of fire and all the lovely things it could do. Light and warmth were just the beginning, but things didnt start getting out of hand until the industrial age. Coal and gas provided much more kick than simple wood, and soon the entire planet was running on the energy produced by fire while the need for more increased with no end in sight. The side effect of all this burning was a couple billion tons of carbon released into the atmosphere on an annual basis with the inevitable result of the planet warming up, leading to the melting of the poles and the release of monsters kept frozen since long before a clever monkey figured out that fire was as useful as it could be terrifying. Now the hemasaurus is free to wreak havoc on the world, stomping cities flat and killing thousands while its actions are focused by the perfectly sane and rational Church of the Holy Lizard.Terror of Hemasaurus is what would happen if Rampage was actually fun and had a point to its carnage. After picking one of the four monsters, each with its own special ability, you start at the left side of a US city and work to the right, causing as much destruction as possible while the percentage counter keeps track of how much damage youve done. Just about everything in the game is a physics object of some sort, whether that be cars you can kick into the buildings for a damaging explosion or the buildings themselves, which will topple over when you destroy the supporting units. Tip one skyscraper into another and it can cause a chain reaction of destruction as the screen gets covered in explosions and flying pixelated bodies. The object is to make a glorious disaster area and the hemasaurus has the moves to lay waste to all of humanitys strongest defenses.The basic attack is the punch, which is useful for doing incremental damage to a building unit. Much like Rampage, each building is made of squares that take individual damage, but unlike Rampage attacking the ones on the bottom can undermine the structure. The problem is that the bottom units are also the strongest, so punching away is only useful on one or two story buildings rather than the skycrapers. For the bigger buildings the hemasaurus needs to find something to kick. Its always fun to kick away all the people scurrying about underfoot but cars and military vehicles do a good chunk of damage to anything they hit, eventually exploding when theyve taken enough damage themselves. While the hemasaurus is overpowered its not invulnerable, and the pesky humans keep fighting back no matter how overwhelming the force against them. Trucker-hatted yahoos take potshots as they stream out of the gun store, police show up regularly and eventually special forces arrive with rocket launchers in tow. While they can damage the hemasaurus they all have a major weakness in that theyre awfully tasty and restore health on consumption. A black van filled with soldiers would be a much worse problem if they werent so easy to kick away or snack on, and of course their handy vehicle makes a great projectile to send flying into the nearest building or a news helicopter. They can attack in large enough numbers that death eventually becomes a possibility, but but once you get a sense of managing the gameplay flow between tearing down buildings and grazing on the dozens of people scurrying about each level, its easy to complete Terror of Hemasaurus story mode. Even the endless arcade mode isnt much of a challenge until around threat level 9 or maybe even higher if youre playing multiplayer.Whether single or multiplayer each player gets to choose from one of four monsters, fully available from the start. All the monsters play the same for the standard abilities, but theyve also got a special attack thats recharged by the amount of destruction they perform. The big green hemasaurus has a roar that radiates out, damaging everything within range, while mecha-hemasaurus has a powerful missile. Clocksloth is a fat sloth that can slow down time, and my personal favorite, salamandrah, has flame-breath you can aim for more focused damage. Humanity doesnt stand much of a chance against the monstrous crew, but the story makes it clear that the kaiju are a much lesser threat.While the arcade mode is pure destruction, the story is always on point with its exasperation at people being too stupid, as a group, to stop global warming. Theres a message here thats by no means subtle and its presented with vicious humor that almost always nails the joke. The story of the defrosted monster and its time being directed by the Church of the Holy Lizard is rude, sweary, frequently meta and always entertaining even if its preaching to the converted. Closing Comments:Terror of Hemasaurus is an immensely entertaining monster-fest that, while never backs down from the carnage, makes the violence work with a layer of cheerful dark humor. The monsters have a good amount of moves and the gameplay takes advantage of all of them, such as the ability to hacky-sack a human for no other reason than it being funny. Is there a reason for giant trampolines to be featured in some levels? Not a good one, no, but slamming down on one to launch into the stratosphere and plummet back to earth with a major butt-pound justifies the inclusion, as does the way cars get bounced into the air when they try to drive over them. Kicking people into helicopter blades, punching down blimps for a massive explosion and chaining building collapses together never gets tiresome, especially when the screen is practically on fire from everything going off at once. Terror of Hemasaurus is pure giant monster carnage and immensely entertaining from start to finish.", "date": "October 17, 2022", "grade": 4.0}
