{"name": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=130594", "text": "Its strange to think that the Hyperdimension Neptunia series, which sprung forth as a parody of the Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii console wars is still relevant today  but it is. This is made readily apparent with a diehard fanbase which continues to buy each new release, spinoff and remake as well as new fans who regularly join the fold. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2 is the latest title out and is a remake of Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 from 2011. Aside from jumping from PS3 to PS Vita, this version includes some new features, characters and other small tweaks to make it all work on a portable platform.Re;Birth 2 brings us back to the magical and game-obsessed world of Gamindustri after the events of the original title. Things are looking grim as all the CPUs have been captured by some terrible being. With tentacles coiled around each gal theres absolutely no way for them to escape. Young CPU Candidate Nepgear rushes back home in hopes of rallying up the support needed to save them all. Of course, with each world focused on gaining enough shares for itself alone they arent willing to simply run right out and save everyone. Nepgear and friends must therefore rally support in each nation and find aid from CPU Candidates in Laststation and Lowee. Thankfully, despite the years since its original release, both Sony and Nintendo still have handheld consoles to keep that massive reference current.Hyperdimension Neptunia was made with gamers in mind but it is especially crafted with fans of Japanese games in mind. There are copious references to be found via an in-game Twitter-like service and, more importantly, through team members. Based off companies such as Falcom, these humanized renditions of companies and consoles are wonderfully silly. For every reference youll nail theres still tons that are incredibly niche. With that said, all of this could simply be considered fluff if the actual underlying game were boring. Luckily, Re;Birth 2 provides a lightweight but enjoyable tale alongside competent combat.Battles are initiated after running into an enemy displayed within a dungeon. From there, your team of up to four ladies duke it out in a turn-based battle system. As with Re;Birth 1, mk2, and Victory, youre given a small area to position your combatants in. Having such a degree of control allows for strategic placing of a teammate so she can hit two enemies with one strike, for example. There are a ton of other little mechanics at play which are not introduced in a particularly friendly way. If youre new to the Neptunia universe then definitely study the tutorial prompts which appear early on as they define the many systems at play. There are means to increase relationships between characters (resulting in special attacks), an EXE gauge and associated movesets, and even an ultra powerful HDD mode which CPU Candidates can invoke at the cost of SP. Despite so much to digest it becomes palpable after a few hours.Fighting is fun primarily due to the strategies youll get to employ in various situations, but also thanks to enemy designs. As with every other aspect of the world the creatures you fight are also video game references. Tetris-like blocks, blue slime creatures, and my personal favorite, a visual novel screen, all attempt to stop players from succeeding. A few enemies are starting to show their age such as one modeled after Brain Ages Dr. Kawashima. Bosses are bulky and generally a bit frightening to go up against which makes for exciting fights. With the right strategy, team layout, and equipment, no monster should pose an insurmountable challenge.Of course, any longtime fan already has the facets of battle under control. Instead, theyll want to know every little tweak to Re;Birth 2 over the original version. The most notable change for both Vita versions is the Remake system. Now its possible to change the games difficulty, amount of monsters per area, strength of said monsters and a handful of other aspects. Beyond that there are some new characters integrated into the story which fit right in. Of course, changes have also been made to the GUI so that it looks clean and modern on a handheld. There do appear to be some sacrifices that come with this portability. During attacks which have large-scale animations the framerate dips significantly. This applies during boss battles but also during regular dungeon fights which is quite unfortunate.Theres something else which has become more apparent thanks to the relatively short release window between Re;Birth1 and 2. The Hyperdimension Neptunia series status as a budget title is obvious when you realize the same level designs and music are reused with startling regularity. Its not terrible, but may surprise those who are more used to JRPGs filled with distinct areas. A final oddity is the awkward lip syncing that occurs when playing with the English dub. Characters mouths will completely stop moving as their voice continues chattering on. If it bothers you then switch over to Japanese instead. Closing Comments:Despite effectively being a game from 2011, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 still provides an enjoyable experience today. Sure, the graphics might not be incredible and the reuse of stages is a little off-putting, but none of that kills its core gameplay or storyline. Both Re;Birth games seem to prove that Hyperdimension Neptunia may have come out a generation too soon as it seems best served on handheld consoles. With the Vita you can play a dungeon or two, quit, and then dive right back into Gamindustris troubles later on. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2 provides many hours of gaming jokes, silly plot developments and strategic battles which adds up to a mostly lovable JRPG.", "date": "January 23, 2015", "grade": 4.0}
