{"name": "Carries Order Up!", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=229463", "text": "It was during the start of 2016 when some eagle-eyed gamers browsing Steam Greenlight and Tumblr first discovered Carries Order Up! This game carrying heavy Diner Dash inspirations looked like a colorful, fast-paced fun time. The game was easily Greenlit in less than a month and development continued. Although developer Ink Dragon Works did end up missing their original Spring 2016 release window, many were still excitedly waiting to play the final game. Now that its available, we can all finally dig in and see if the title was all that was promised. If nothing else, it scratches the itch with some simple to grasp yet challenging to master arcade style gameplay. At first glance, Carries Order Up! seems very much akin to yet another take on the classic Diner Dash formula. To some extent, this does hold true. In that title, players were tasked with bringing the right food items to different customers at the restaurant. Here, youre given much the same goal  but gameplay has been expanded. As protagonist Carrie seeks to deliver food to the oceanic customers in quick fashion, she must also avoid running head first into them as they seek out a table. For whatever reason, theres no real management of the restaurant itself. Feeding all the hungry folk is up entirely to Carrie, the waitress, and Calcia, the cook. The aspect of avoidance on each maze-like level makes for gameplay reminiscent of Pac-Man. Just like ghosts, you really are best off avoiding customers while making the rounds.There are key differences, of course. Unlike Pac-Man, you can actually run into the meandering customers (or avoid them by spinning). Smacking into them displaces the customer and may cost you one of three allowed mistakes depending on the difficulty setting. Beyond that, a crash simply slows down the process of delivering food. With each customer getting hungrier by the minute, delays are the last thing you want. If a customer is forced to wait too long then theyll eventually throw a fit and leave. This always counts as a mistake. Stacking up tons of food dishes for easy delivery works well, but its not only delivery that one needs to worry about. After a customer gobbles up their meal they leave behind a plate. Plates must be picked up on occasion to make room for other guests to sit at that spot. Unfortunately, its impossible for Carrie or Calcia to hold both food plates and clear plates at the same time. As such, its imperative to work quickly by clearing away plates, going back to serving, and on and on. Although there are two difficulty settings, both get hectic rather quick. The main difference is its much easier for a mistake to count on Arcade mode than Friendly mode. Regardless of the difficulty, there are twenty stages to complete in Service mode. Once all this is taken care of you unlock Calcia for play. Theres a perk to this other than seeing a new character sprite on screen. Calcia is able to spin far longer than Carrie can. Both characters do eventually get dizzy from spinning, though, which causes a break in the action. To balance out her superpowered spinning abilities, Calcia slows down as more plates pile up in her hand. This tweak makes her better for players who keep pace with each and every order by delivering them quickly. Folks with the strategy of piling up tons of plates in one go should stick with Carrie.After completing Service mode, there are still ways to play around with Carries Order Up! Next on the menu is Endless mode. Despite its name, you really only need to complete each area up to a required money amount. After that, youre free to check out the next stage and beat its score. Of course, those who can perform far better should play as long as possible for a ridiculous high score. One bonus of playing well (or simply a lot) is the fact that an overall money value is tracked throughout. The more you make, the more goodies you unlock. Mainly unlocks consist of cute new outfits, but its a simple and enjoyable way to extend gameplay. Steam Achievements also do their best to compel folks into playing even more by completing challenges, hitting money targets, and the like. For some, they might not find much compulsion to continue playing after spending a few hours with the game, though.One aspect which cant be ignored in Carries Order Up! is its adorable theme and artwork. The aquatic concept means that guests come in the form of beefy sharks, slow whales, slim eels and more. Each guest looks entirely adorable rendered in a 32-bit styled pixel art way. Of course, Carrie and Calcia look great too as they run throughout the restaurant with plates piled high. There are a few different restaurant settings but none of them look all that different aside from being bigger or smaller than others. It would have been fun to see more divergence between stages to match with the uniqueness of the many customers. Theres a costume which changes visuals, but this can be a bit confusing to use after getting accustomed to food items and such looking a specific way. Carries Order Up! trips in a few ways, though none of them are game-breaking. The biggest issue appears to be with regards to controller support. Yes, a gamepad is fully supported, but it truly feels that it isnt quite precise enough. When using a controller it felt like there were more instances of Carrie/Calcia missing turns despite hitting the correct direction on a controller. This did not seem to be the case when playing with keyboard controls instead. Obviously, making a movement mistake is a huge deal in such a fast-paced title. It then requires the player to correct themselves and potentially make larger mistakes. Theres also a matter of one of the power ups. It gives the protagonist a speed boost which often feels more harmful than helpful, especially with controller. If turns are often missed at normal speed, the faster movement causes even more trouble. Closing Comments: Theres a lot to like about Carries Order Up! The charming concept and visuals enhance its core frantic arcade gameplay. Serving customers is hectic fun and failures usually seem fair. Completing the main mode might not take very long, but the game continues to add value with additional modes and challenges. It would be nice if there were given a few more more modes to compete in, or even a simple multiplayer mode to flesh things out further. This potential controller lag issue also deserves some investigation or a solution for afflicted players. Still, given the price of $2.99, its safe to say that Carries Order Up! serves a tasty dish of arcade play for a low price.", "date": "October 6, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
