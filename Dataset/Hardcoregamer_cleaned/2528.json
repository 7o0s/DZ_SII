When not handled well it can feel like its railroading the player down a preset path with the idea of interactivity being forgotten in order to force the story through. When done right, however, you get Attack of the Friday Monsters! A Tokyo Tale. The charm and utter adorableness of absolutely every part of the package is simply a bonus.Friday Monsters is the story of Sohta, a young boy whos recently moved into town, and its Friday night so the kaiju monsters will be attacking soon. The adults arent too worried about this, but the kids are getting ready to head to the hilltop, where theyll watch the weekly spectacle of the monster being defeated by the brave forces of whatever heroic organization is doing the fighting. Its a perfect sunny afternoon, the town is filled with friendly people to talk to, and everyone has a subplot to explore. The nostalgia for a romanticized version of 1970s Japan sounds like it would overwhelm Friday Monsters, but the world and its characters are presented with such a likeable touch that its almost impossible for ones internal grumpy cynic to awaken.As Sohta makes his way from his parents dry cleaners shop, he can freely explore the town and talk to its inhabitants. The town is presented in a fixed-camera style, with each section viewed from a set angle. The town is small enough that its easy to navigate, and the minimap on the touch screen always lets you know where to find the next plot point. Sohta runs through town, meets its inhabitants, gets ready for the big evening monster attack, and makes friends with the local kids by playing cards.Most of Friday Monsters can be solved simply by talking to everyone, but the kids have a card game that they challenge each other to. Its a form of Rock Paper Scissors played with five cards, and cards are earned by finding or earning eight of the same kind of glim. As you explore the map glims are scattered about the landscape, some obvious and others hidden, and Sohta grabs them automatically by running over them. Once hes got five cards completed he can play the other kids in town, and the winner becomes the boss of the loser. The advantage of being the boss is that the other kids will give Sohta more info, and its always good to be listened to when a giant monster attack is imminent.Closing Comments:", "date": "July 25, 2013", "grade": 4.5}
