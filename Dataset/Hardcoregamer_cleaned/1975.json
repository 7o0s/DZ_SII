If you do, shell suck you into a bag, call you out on your lies, and go hunting for anyone you say youre with. Its just bad times all-around and something that wont benefit your life. Plus, you dont want to piss off someone who can transform into either child, adult, or gigantic beast forms. Its a tangled legal web at best, and its going to get you in a whole heap of trouble at worst. Rajyas got a bit of baggage attached to her, but luckily for you, she takes it out on enemies and to a lesser extent, her husband-to-be Seikichi.The other Muramasa DLCs have been fairly serious, but this is the most comedy-centric one, and makes for a fun finale. Theres a light-hearted tone to everything, and the dialogue is easily the funniest in the franchises history. Gameplay-wise, Rajya plays very differently than the other characters thanks to her forms being so very different. Her child form attacks much faster than her adult form, but that form does so much damage that the pros and cons of each must be weighed. A ton of enemies can be quickly taken out as a kid, but it may be more efficient to take out a couple as an adult, thin the herd as a result, and then get the rest taken care of with the faster form. The demon gauge prevents becoming overwhelmed, as if its full, her beast form can be used to dole out tons of damage quickly.Beyond just being able to punch things out, players can also transform into a giant fireball while holding the circle button. Its path is controlled with the left stick to quickly do a ton of damage to a swarm of enemies quickly since they like to attack in packs. Fireballs are also used in her adult form by just pressing circle, and it never ceases to be at least a little funny to see a fireball used as a baseball while a tribal sword is used like a bat. Her child attack with circle involves grabbing a hammer and bonking everyone like Mario in the original Donkey Kong  complete with limited animation. Again, this is one of those little things that always makes me laugh. In another little classic Nintendo homage, she can also float around like Princess Toadstool in Super Mario Bros. 2. Its a great way to get away from enemies and regroup a bit. This strategy isnt going to save you like form switching will, but it still comes in handy.Shes not the deepest character, but the overwhelming comedy works surprisingly well. The last DLC in particular was dark, and the whole series has been fairly serious. A little levity goes a long way here because everything that happens is both played straight by Rajya, while tropes and the sheer absurdity of things are pointed out by other characters. This is a silly adventure, but its a lot of fun to go on and the already-sharp writing is put through its paces here. Those who dont like comedy in games may not care for it, but its a welcome as a change of pace.From an audio/visual perspective, Hells Where the Heart Is falls in line with the main Rebirth game and the other DLC: stunning. When youve got a visual style that impresses even on the primitive Wii hardware, you know its a winner, and the refinements and color saturation changes to Rebirth have only helped the DLC. Rajyas animations are smooth, and the limited hammer-bonking animation functions well. Her character design is too generic, though, but at least works well in three forms.Musically, the soundtrack remains strong with a lot of woodland instrumental music to get across the feudal Japan setting. The slashing and fire sound effects are excellent as well. There isnt much in the way of voice work, but what little is on display seems fine. 99% of the dialogue is text-based, making this a good choice for those in situations where audio isnt an option.Closing Comments:", "date": "September 6, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
