{"name": "Sportsfriends", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=83959", "text": "The initial Kickstarter pitch video made Sportsfriends seem like a game that just wanted everyone who played it to have a good time. Sure enough, it is! My house has three people in it  myself, a grandmother, and her grandson. Each and every one of us loved this game for different reasons, leaving us with at least a few memories. Its been nearly six months since the PS4s launch, and in that time, my PS camera has been used for maybe one hour. Now, Sportsfriends makes that device seem like a must-have.Its by far the best game to use the thing, and has some benefits over PS3-only users. The biggest one is that DualShock 4 pads can be used instead of PS Move controllers  so it gives you a bit more flexibility with your control schemes. You dont need to worry about having some PS Move pads lying around, and since theyre not quite bargain bin fodder yet, just grabbing them can be a bit expensive, and hard to justify for just one game. However, PS4 owners are a bit more likely to have at least one Move lying around, and this lets you get at least some use out of it once you dust it off and recharge it. Honestly, whos actually used the thing expect for when HOTD: Overkill went on a PSN super-sale?Barbariball is the first mode offered up and can best be described as a platforming version of soccer with water. Its a one-on-one or two-on-two game with each side using a particular color. If youre the yellow character, you want to grab the ball and put it in the yellow side of the water, while purple will want to do the same for its color. The players character is essentially acting as a goalie and you can do whatever you need to get the ball on your side. There are numerous character types to choose from with your powerhouse type, average type, and speedster. Jumping is a big part of the game, and youll need to be mindful of it because you only have a limited amount of jumps before you need to refill the supply of tiny spheres around your character that indicate how many jumps you can do.If you burn through 90% of your jumps to get the ball, then you wind up risking that youll end up drowning on the last jump and giving your rival a chance to grab the ball. If he does, you can be revived in time, but itll be tough. Another big thing is that you can save the ball from the water as long as its visible on-screen. If its to the point where an arrow is at the bottom of the screen, youll lose a point  but if its just hit the water, jump in and go for a recovery. Points are gained for successful scores, and lost for having your character drown. You can also feign drowning to lure an enemy into a false sense of security, then hop out quickly to win. This is a super-competitive game and a lot of fun to play.</span></span>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byQPWWs6lK4<span class=~SmallText~><span class=~NormalText~>Johan Sebastian Joust is the simplest game to describe, but the hardest to explain just why its so darned fun! This music-heavy mode gives you a ton of options, largely revolving around the voice work. You get a pleasant voice listing the name and the winner no matter what, but just having options for something so minor is amusing. The core game involves everyone grabbing a Move controller, or a combination of Moves and Dual Shock 4 pads on the PS4 and standing in a semi-circle. The goal is to move the device slowly when the song is slow, and then speed up a tad when it speeds up. However, since this is tied to the movement of the controller, someone can screw with you and move your hand swiftly to cause you to lose! Laughter, light-hearted yelling, and perhaps a swear or two will be common during extended play sessions. Sure, it sucks to lose in any game  but its really hard to get angry about losing here. Youre controlling a slightly-animated character playing a musical instrument, and the colors are so bright and the music is so relaxing that you cant get mad. Its a blast! This is one of those experiences you just have to try for yourself, because words cant do it justice.Super Pole Riders may have a title that seems slightly lewd, but the actual game isnt! Here, each player starts on one side with a ball in the center and a target at each end. Your goal is to get the ball to hit your target however you need to. You can use the pole vault itself to nudge it, or vault high and hopefully kick it to move it a lot. This requires a lot of precision though, and missing has a huge penalty. It takes a while to reset and get back into position  giving your opponent a chance to gain the upper hand. The Joust name mightve been better here since like Joust (and Balloon Fight), you can get squashed by someone above you. Here, you just wait to respawn, but that little mechanic makes things very interesting  and funny when you walk on the pole vault to squash them. Theres a fantastic sudden death mode where your pole vaults turn into gigantic hammers and the first person to either get a kill or a point wins. This is probably the most addictive mode to play one on one, as it lacks the cheapness of Barbariball, and has the added comedy of you sometimes helping your opponent out by using your own pole vault against yourself accidentally.Visually, Sportsfriends goes for a pixelart look most of the time, and it works well. Despite the aged look, the bright colors ensure that it is still a stunning game to behold  with silky-smooth animation throughout. Even JH Joust has that, which youll notice only in videos because its impossible to really pay attention to the game and that at the same time. The music goes for a similarly retro vibe, and works a bit less well. The chiptune soundtrack is fun to listen to in the game, but isnt something Id want to hear outside of it. Still, its a lot of fun to hear in the game and since it helps add excitement to a game with that as the most important element, its hard to call it bad.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 7, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
