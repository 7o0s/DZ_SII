{"name": "Trinity Trigger", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=440395", "text": "Theres a lot to love about a traditional fantasy setting in an RPG, but for those seeking a lot more action and wanting less waiting around, XSEED has Trinity Trigger to fill that void. It starts off familiar enough with our hero Cyan waking up from a slumber by his adopted sister, but then quickly moves on at a rapid-fire pace plot-wise. One of Trinity Triggers greatest strengths as a modern-day RPG is respecting the time of the player and making everything you do feel like it serves a grander purpose in the narrative.The world of Trinity Trigger is set up by a war between the Gods of Order and Chaos, and with Cyan as a God of Chaos, he has to fight the label of evil given to him by virtue of the chaos mark on his right eye. The minute the adventure begins, youre thrown into this grand tale and meet a slew of new characters without an hour or so  all who are out to help unravel the mysteries of the world and some that are effectively playable weapons. Your party has animal-influenced helpers that are also rooted in elements that can help destroy certain parts of the map to uncover goodies while exploring the overworld.Combat occurs in both regular dungeons with tougher enemies and sometimes light puzzle solving and on the overworld itself. The design of having combat areas in regular parts of the environment right next to the town itself helps raise the stakes because you go from seeing and meeting the townspeople and getting to know a few of them and seeing just how close the monsters are to the town. It makes me as the player want to take out foes to keep people safe and exploration is constantly rewarded. Finding shortcuts throughout the overworld battle areas usually results in finding potions, which is a nice money-saver, while puzzle-solving in dungeons nets things like raw materials for upgrades or higher-end items. The environmental puzzles are fun, with an early area shining with lit mushrooms offering up either health for a green mushroom, light for your path with a yellow one, or an explosive effect with a red one that allows you to take out enemies or just take out parts of the environment to find hidden stuff.Combat can be either short or long-range depending on what weapon you have equipped alongside which character youre using. You can switch between characters using a trigger and change out weapon types depending on whats in your inventory and a quick weapon circle selection. Fast action is also possible with a hotkey setup, which is great to have available in a pinch  especially during tough boss battles. The toughest challenges come from learning new things right away since there arent multiple difficulty levels and you do have to learn swiftly or from trial and error.Fortunately, checkpoints are generous with one before a dungeon, mid-way and then right before a boss door. There are also healing/save stations and areas to buy goods in the dungeon so you arent stuck without enough healing items  whether theyre to bring your HP back up or take care of poison or other maladies. Trinity Trigger strikes a fine balance between challenging the player and offering enough options to get through an area. One low-key great way to tackle a boss is to try a different character out for it. While Cyan is a jack of all trades, having a master of long-range arrow work at your command may be the best option when surrounded by enemies. Cyans skills with his helper-infused blade allows him to quickly deal out a lot of damage, which comes in handy in areas with either a small amount of area to work with or a small visible area to see as some areas need makeshift lamps to have decent visibility. Trinity Trigger controls well overall with a logical control scheme across the board. Visually, Trinity Trigger is a mixed bag of being gorgeous for its anime cutscenes and rough around the edges when it comes to its environmental textures. It very much looks like a game that was designed for lower-spec hardware across the board, which has its benefits for owners of an older computer, but does result in muddy textures for parts of the environment viewed up close during panning shots. Its not altogether bad though, evoking an HD GameCube game in execution which works well for the genre. Character animation is solid across the board, especially for combat, where its got a good blend of depth and being quick to move around and attack without being slowed down by elaborate animation.The game is nearly-fully voice acted and the voice work is outstanding. This is one of the best dubs an RPG has gotten in a while and the action-heavy nature of it does lend itself to that possibly getting old during battle, unlike the Xenoblade Chronicles games the voice clips arent repeated too much one right after the other. Its still an issue  just not as big of one as it is for larger-scale games in the same genre. Trinity Triggers soundtrack is also top-notch across the board, with relaxing music in towns and a fantastic mix of rock and heavier woodland instrumental songs during battle. Closing Comments:XSEED has a hit on their hands with Trinity Trigger. Everything about the game is enjoyable and in the case of the story and combat, everything perfectly gels together. The action has a good clip to it  not being too slow or too frantic and youre eased into the systems gradually to avoid being overloaded with information dumps too often. The flow of the action from battles to relaxing town sections makes for a nice balance and having enemies so close to the towns themselves does a nice job of showing that there are stakes to whats going on in the world. This isnt the prettiest-looking game in some ways due to texture problems, but it doesnt slow down or have framerate dips and the anime cinematics are gorgeous. The soundtrack is top-tier as well, with a mix of relaxing songs for towns and action-heavy tunes for battle while voice acting helps the characters stand out more than they would with just text bubbles. Anyone on the lookout for a new action RPG will find a lot to love with Trinity Trigger, especially if something that blends fantasy with a slice of life is desired.", "date": "April 25, 2023", "grade": 4.0}
