Life is too short to spend it purposely creating inept or disappointing games and even the simplest product takes a lot of time and effort to bring to fruition. Then I play a game like Death by Game Show and I begin to wonder if my naive optimism is misguided.Both conceptually simple and incredibly difficult and frustrating, Death by Game Show is a mash-up of genres. Its 500 years in the future, the world is controlled by robots. You play a relatively intelligent human (U.H. Wutt  Uh, What, get it?) sentenced to die via a blood sport/game show. Youre plopped down onto a planet and you summon defensive droids from a floating machine chained to your character and place towers against waves of enemies, a la a tower defense game. The fifty levels themselves are time-based, lasting from a few seconds to several minutes, but basically have a single objective: survive, collect cash and move on. For each level, there are a limited number of droids and buildings so they must be used wisely. A big game show spinning wheel doles out rewards and while the challenges dramatically increase after the opening tutorial levels, the stages never really open up much. Theyre always narrow little right-to-left pathways blocked by electrified barriers. Level 30 looks an awful lot like level 3 like level 13. Fiddly controls and the games zero tolerance for error mean that a mistake in facing or timing result in failure and the necessity to start the level again. Of course, as in any game, the equation of reward and challenge will either make trying again a pleasure or an irritation. Unfortunately, Death by Game Shows rewards for completing a level are mostly the satisfaction of being done with it wedded to the depressing realization that another frustrating level awaits. There is certainly a puzzle aspect to figuring out the solution to surviving a stage. Visually, the game makes an incredibly bad first impression, with a cartoon art style that Im guessing is sort of a cross between Terry Gilliam and the Beavis and Butthead school of design. Every stage is a distracting, messy jumble of too much filler text and pointless reminders (i.e. Dont Die!), and too many visual elements to attend to. Its a very visually off-putting and fatiguing style from first frame to last, and while there are some small variations in scenery or marginally different colors for night levels, the look of Death by Game Show doesnt have much range.The developers have stated that Death by Game Show was inspired by Mike Judges film Idiocracy. Where Judge is a coherent and often brilliant social satirist, however, Death by Game Show is simply a premise and a disjunct collection of one-liners and contemporary pop culture riffs  which, by the way, dont really make sense in a far distant future populated by robots. The game doesnt really have a story beyond the set-up, which places the odd remaining human in a survive or die situation for the amusement of the robot overlords. As premises go, it isnt a bad one, but nothing is done with it. A level editor and Steam Workshop are included. Closing Comments:Death by Game Show is not an incompetently made game, but as a collection of design decisions the sum and its individual parts are annoying, disappointing or frustrating. Its a difficult game that doesnt allow or encourage creativity in solving its gameplay puzzles and its rewards are simply not gratifying enough to justify its repetitive nature. Some might like the games art direction  I didnt  but it would be hard to argue in favor of Death by Game Shows attempts at humor: Death by Game Show is not very funny.", "date": "February 2, 2016", "grade": 2.5}
