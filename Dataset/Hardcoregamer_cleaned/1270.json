Sure, its low budget shenanigans are absolutely rough around the edges, but that is part of the charm. Otherwise, being handed a weapon and pointed in the direction of an indescribable mass of hairy tarantula flesh just scratches an itch that most people didnt know existed. Developer Sandlot gets it, though. Thanks to them, and XSEED, we have a wealth of riches to obliterate. In addition to the PS4 Earth Defense Force 4.1 upgrade of EDF 2025, we also have this Vita alternative in Earth Defense Force 2: Invaders From Planet Space, a port of the previously Japan-only Global Defense Force.For the uninitiated, the easiest way to describe an EDF title would be to cross breed Dynasty Warriors with the film Starship Troopers and then smack it in the head with a shovel until it starts drooling. This is absolutely meant to be a complement. The plot is simple: Earth is being invaded by being from beyond the stars. The invasion plan is to infest our home with giant ants, arachnids and other creepy crawlies to soften the populace up. Afterwards, it would be a matter of sending in the giant robots and flying saucers to mop up, and the aliens have themselves a new planet. Why they would want a planet covered in giant bugs is a question better left unexplored. Still, it makes a heck of a lot more sense than the plot of Signs.The play itself is cathartic bliss. Each of the bite-sized missions drops the player into a large map and a target of some type. Usually, this is a swarm of things, though sometimes it might be a kaiju or a series of enemy spawning saucers. Using between two or three weapons chosen before battle, the player must clear the map while picking up armor to extend health for subsequent missions, and weapons, of which there are over five hundred. Wash, rinse and repeat.This might seem like there is a lack of variety, but there are limitless ways to win. First, there are three different classes to choose from. The Infantry plays like the soldier from Earth Defense Force 2017, can take quite a bit of damage and tends to favor conventional weapons. The Pale Wing is the jet pack equipped class. Her weapons tends to be more futuristic in nature and share the same constantly replenishing energy pool to charge them as is used to take to the skies. She tends to be a bit more fragile. Finally, there is a bizarrely-named Air Raider. He is more of a support class, designed to help teammates in multiplayer battles, as well as use cunning traps and techniques to use the ridiculously stupid enemy A.I. against itself. These probably sound familiar to those who played 2025. Fortunately, the useless Fencer class has been removed. Its not often that a class removal results in a stronger game, but there it is. For those who have played 2025, this is an alternate version of the timeline. Quite a bit of the story plays out the same, but with a few tweaks. First of all, many enemies have been completely redesigned. The walker robots are now four-limbed monstrosities that function the same. The base saucers and U.F.O. designs have also been tweaked to a purple lined retro-futuristic like that complements the Vitas graphics capabilities better and just plain looks cooler. While the ghastly retiarius (*shudder*) has been blessedly removed, a new type of small saucer has been added. This one reflects any shot that is not dead center back at the player.A few other concessions to playability have been made. No longer does the player need to jockey for an angle to send a rocket up the enemy spawning poop chute of the giant saucers. Hitting it anywhere seems to function just fine. The reload times and weapons balance also appears to have been tweaked a bit in favor of letting the player spend more time shooting and less time reloading from the infinite pool of ammunition. Some of the fat has been trimmed from the mission structure, as well. This is a game that encourages replay on harder difficulty levels for better weapons and rewards. Paring down to an all killer, no filler structure increases the desire to do this ten-fold. There are still seventy-eight missions here, so there is no feeling of being short-changed. This isnt to mention other surprises that pop up along the way.The title is not completely flawless, though. While quite a bit of work was done to spiffy up what was, originally, a PS2 title, there is some muddy texture work found in some places. It simply isnt as sharp looking as 2025 was. Also, while the controls mostly work well, precision shots are more difficult to pull off with the Vitas smaller sticks. This last part isnt too big of a deal and the targets are typically large, squishy and clustered together. Its still easy to shoot a rocket with high splash damage into a squirming mass and be rewarded with bug corpses screaming through the skies. Closing Comments:Since Earth Defense Force 2017 was brought stateside on the 360, this cult favorite series has seen its share of ups and downs. While interesting, the western-developed Insect Armageddon was not what fans were wanting. The follow up from the original developers, Sandlot, found in 2025 was good, but somewhat flabby. This Vita version of an older title has managed to up the game, surpassing the goofy, B-movie fun found in 2017. Anyone who has not yet experienced one of these titles is highly encouraged to start here.", "date": "Bohn on December 8, 2015", "grade": 4.0}
