{"name": "Bedlam", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=171604", "text": "Bedlam has intrigued me since it first showed up on Steam Early Access. It sounded like an awesome romp for longtime fans of video games thanks to its basic premise. You see, somehow, it appears that protagonist Heather (or Athena) has found herself mixed up in a world of video games. Instead of simply drawing from one gaming landscape, she is forced to travel throughout titles from different eras and even a few different genres on her trek to make it back to reality. With such a neat concept, it was clear Bedlam would be something worth checking out once it left Early Access. Well, the time has finally arrived. The question is whether or not the game can actually live up to its intriguing presentation.Unfortunately, this is all to say that Bedlam does not live up to its aims. Theres no doubt that it tries hard, though, evidenced by the loving way it recounts gaming history. Players begin in a FPS gaming realm not unlike the older Quake or Unreal Tournament. With slightly pixelated textures and polygonal dudes, it feels almost like going back in time. Players are then transported to other worlds which draw straight from the collective memories of FPS fans. A tremendously Call of Duty-inspired (the originals, not their modern incarnations) World War II sequence comes next. Later, were even treated to a landscape that any Halo fan will find eerily reminiscent of the original Xbox classic. Hell, you even see far older throwbacks such as retro arcade games given a coat of fresh paint.Bedlam draws attention thanks to its awesome setting(s) placed practically within real games that players will readily recall. Even so, the surroundings fail to carry the action on their own. Lets take Death or Glory world for example. Its modeled after the original Call of Duty titles and pits you against German soldiers in a war-torn city. Thats fine and all, except for the fact that every city block looks almost exactly alike. After walking around for a minute or two youll very likely find yourself completely lost. Have you been to this part of the map before? How can you tell when it looks like every other area? This issue continues into other stages as well and disorientation is the last thing you want when trying to clear objectives and stay alive.Reference alone isnt enough to make something enjoyable. The references simply must be paired with a reason to play through them and see Bedlam through to completion. Although the game does jump players into a few non-FPS worlds (such as a real time strategy segment and first person Pac-Man area), youre still always toting a gun. The FPS gameplay reigns supreme so youll be doing a heck of a lot of shooting throughout. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with that in theory. The aspect which breaks the experience is that the gameplay isnt executed in a particularly enjoyable way. At first, sure, you try your best to kick serious butt and pay with at least a little bit of care. Even on easy, you wont survive long by simply running out in open areas and shooting wildly.But, as the experience drags on, youll find that the copious amount of enemies at every turn is hardly worth your time. Eventually, the continual swarm of baddies becomes so bad that the best choice seems to be simply running through them all, only shooting dudes directly in your path. That style of play doesnt always work as planned, of course, as sometimes the reign of bullets will take you down with little effort. On the positive side, alongside fairly frequent autosaves there is the potential to save (almost) anywhere you like. Because of this you can quickly restart from a nearby save after being mowed down for the umpeenth time. When you cant even enjoy your huge stash of guns in a FPS then there might be an issue.One plus is that once you beat Bedlam you actually gain access to an infinite ammo feature. This, along with the fact that youll now have every weapon in the game, makes for a slightly more enjoyable run. After all, you can then choose to wield goodies such as a flaming sword or rocket launcher to stop anything in your path. Getting through the six hour campaign once to activate such features isnt going to be worth it for most players, though. The gameplay itself just isnt that fun. Outside of the copious enemies, which become only more numerous as time goes on, sometimes theyre completely brainless. You might find them running away rather than at you, and others simply stare at walls until you unceremoniously kill them.Music is a high point for Bedlam. As with the themed landscapes which youll explore, the soundtrack tweaks itself to fit appropriately with different genres and timeframes. With that said, sometimes the music cuts out entirely for segments and definitely appears to be a bug. Voice acting is especially well done for Heather/Athena and the cast of other people she meets along the way. Everyone has a distinct voice and really help add some weight to the otherwise average storyline. Sound effects seem to have been the last on anyones mind, though, as some are particularly grating on the ears.Closing Comments:Bedlam had so much promise. The idea of somehow getting stuck within a variety of video games and needing to survive them all to leave is downright neat. Actually seeing recreations of games that many of us are familiar with, and playing through them with a different context, is similarly cool. What isnt awesome is playing and realizing that none of the actual gameplay feels particularly good. Its repetitive in its continuous swarms of enemies, challenging in the constant flurry of bullets headed your way and ends up sapping most of the potential fun out of itself. Bedlam may suit your needs if all you need is a trip down FPS memory lane, but youre better off seeking any number of similar titles which actually offer compelling gameplay.", "date": "October 12, 2015", "grade": 2.0}
