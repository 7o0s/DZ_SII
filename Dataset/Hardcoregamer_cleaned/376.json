{"name": "Pro Evolution Soccer 2018", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=272386", "text": "Say what you will about the nature of annual franchises, but if recent history is anything to go by, incremental upgrading to the gameplay and the return of a mode familiar to long-time fans will go a long way to making the latest entry feel viable, let alone enjoyable to play. Konamis long-running, long-loved Pro Evolution Soccer series has always been lauded on its mechanical additions, regardless of how subtle or otherwise initially unseen they might be. But this is likely why PES has garnered a more trust-worthy face in comparison to its obvious competitor, the [equally-established] FIFA series. Where EA have long strutted the glamorous and visually-prevalent route with little to show, PES has remained unabashed in its willingness to dig beneath the superficial layer of sleek graphics and vibrant presentation.Were three years into the series now-established foundation on the Fox engine and while that fact may feel like old news and not drive as much the same delighted surprise, theres no denying that the physicality and moment-to-moment gameplay is one to admire. Whats more admirable though for this years entry is how well PES 2018 has transitioned to a slower but more calculating style of play, yet retaining the complexion but satisfaction in getting a[nother] win under your belt. And more importantly, knowing its come by way of ones own sound and tactical use of the games very many mechanics on show. Despite then the conservative move away from frantic passes and hectic one-two touches, it means that the subtle additions to this years release can ultimately flourish. Notably the in-game physics to both the players and indeed the ball everyone is aiming to take possession of.PES 2018 renders matches in a more realistic fashion in regards to the weight and control of ones passing. A lot of this is down to the new Real Touch+ mechanic which adds another layer to players control over the ball  meaning that they will use multiple parts of their body depending on the situation. Stretching the leg to counter a fast shot, using the chest to control an aerial one, even turning ones back to shield the ball from an approaching opponent. Given the viewing distance and perhaps insignificant presence of each of these decisions visually, its surprising how well these alterations benefit the overall flow, meaning that movement feels fluid at a player-level but in turn, more physically challenging across the entire breadth of the pitch. Not that the series hasnt already factored a real sense of strategy and emphasis on reading a players strengths/weaknesses into matches, not to mention staying alert to the most unlikely of scenarios or figurative spanners thrown into ones game-plan. Reading the way the ball moves, be it under or otherwise devoid of weather/pitch conditions, or simply keeping your squad from making an unnecessary tackle from the wrong angle. It means that regardless of the final score  whether youve managed to come from behind to snatch a late 2-1 win, or come out runaway winners without conceding a single goal  PES 2018, at its heart, remains a game defined by your decisions. And be they good or bad, no matter how the score-line ends, part of the joy is watching all this unfold and more importantly, knowing that youre in no way disconnected from the mechanics on offer. Regardless of how deep you go into the tactics and pre-match decision-making on offer  whether you choose to implement advanced offensive/defensive moves that you switch between at the tap of a button, or simply leave it to mastering the physics on show.Every goal scored feels like a genuine accomplishment, a triumph of ones understanding of the game  least of all when it comes by way of a counter-attack following a successful defense from opponent pressure. Moments such as these are the reason why the moreish one more game symptom of PES remains prominent, no matter the final score. Whether this is the reason why the dreaded rage-quitters are in shorter supply this year remains to be seen, but the irony is that for a game so heavily prevalent on its in-depth mechanics, PES 2018 never feels like its excluding any degree of skill-level or experience with the series so far. Providing one is willing to sit down and bear the brunt of a loss or two in the early proceedings  perhaps find one is learning over the slower pace that dictates large parts of the action  the addictiveness and subsequent accessibility of the gameplay is the series blessing in disguise. As entertaining as it may be to watch and control all of this, there sadly remains a few legacy issues that once more taint PES near-flawless presentation and stops this years release from achieving crowning glory. And while some moments are easy to laugh off and ignore  an irate goalkeeper shouting to his defense while his face clips into the goal-postor a forward player cycling through three preset animations after a shot on goal, as if the number-crunching parts arent quite sure what to offer up  others meanwhile make their presence known in all the wrong ways. Goalkeepers, despite the improved versatility in their movement, seem to favour dramatics and only dramatics, regardless of the shot and, worse, establish themselves once again as the weakest link in what might be a heavily-strategised strong outfit. Keepers will, majority of the times, decide on the wrong defensive maneuver  parrying a ball with little strength or out-right refusing to collect a ball with minimal threat.But the games biggest draw is of course its in-game commentary which once again proves itself the most artificial and subsequently distracting element of the experience. Despite the over-zealous and sudden cries of Diego COSTAAAAA to denote every shot on goal one minute, or the ample reminders that a player really wanted that, PES commentary feels not only lacking in variety, but its disjointed tone (from analytical to celebratory in the blink of an eye) seldom runs tandem with the action on the pitch. The amount of times a keeper too has been given an A+ grade; it takes little time for the games shallow amalgamation of recorded lines to grate on the ear and worse, detract from the tension and immersion that matches genuinely carve out. Off the pitch, PES 2018s notable additions offer some more interesting insight to the game collectively, more so than the aforementioned commentary at least, but at points feel like works-in-progress demanding of a bit more fleshed-out substance. The return of Random Selection at least garners a notable surprise in how engrossed one can get over something so simple as holding onto a highly-ranked player. But while Master League does extend the reach you have as a manager guiding your team to victory over a season (and hoping to maintain your employment at your chosen club as a result), the simulation-esque structure wont be pitting itself against Segas long-standing Football Manager series anytime soon. Despite its attempts to integrate a cutscene or two, or tabloid-style headlines to note your players current status/mood/opinion.Whats more  not that this doesnt concern a lot of other areas of the game from a presentation stand-point  but the design and UI layout feels far too stylized and contemporarily confined to the point that it makes recent renditions of the Windows OS look tolerable. The notable focus on large, blocky squares with thin, tiny writing may rub only a select few the wrong way, but its overly-designed, overly-simplified presence seems like wasted space, particularly when it comes off as a substitute for what might have been a more fleshed-out, strategy-focused manner to interact with your team or the many facets of the club youre a part of. Closing Comments:All in all, the line on the graph that is PES progression as a series has gone up with Pro Evolution Soccer 2018. A game that might have ran the risk of deterring its loyal fan-base, the improved physicality to player animations and actions only adds another layer to the series already layered strategy that feels genuinely entertaining to watch as it is to play, regardless of the outcome. But while this years improvements are at the forefront more than 2017s showing, the return of series-old issues both on and off the pitch prevent this years iteration from reaching the same champion-level heights the likes of PES 2016 so wonderfully claimed. But it says something when even a fair handful of criticisms do little to detract from the pleasure of the core gameplay. Cliche as it may sound in the context of the sport, but its what happens on the pitch that matters and PES 2018 proves once again its the king of football titles.", "date": "September 18, 2017", "grade": 4.0}
