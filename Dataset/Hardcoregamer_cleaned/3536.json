{"name": "The Council", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=323389", "text": "Editors note: with Big Bad Wolfs The Council ending with the release of Episode 5: Checkmate last month, Hardcore Gamer is now reviewing the title in its entirety. If youre interested in finding out what we thought of each episode in The Council individually, then be sure to check out our reviews for Episode 1: The Mad Ones, Episode 2: Hide and Seek, Episode 3: Ripples, Episode 4: Burning Bridges and Episode 5: Checkmate. Its also worth noting that this review contains minor spoilers from The Council.The Council has been a breath of fresh air for episodic gaming. While the point-and-click formula had been successful for Telltale Games (and other developers), its hardly surprising that players would experience fatigue with the studios work after many years. Interestingly, Big Bad Wolf debuted its episodic title in the same year that the Tales from the Borderlands and Batman: The Enemy Within developer met its unfortunate demise, but The Council only reinforced that episodic gaming could  and would  be more than a one-trick pony. The French studio shattered the illusion of choice often found in Telltales titles, with the choices made across Episode 1: The Mad Ones, Episode 2: Hide and Seek, Episode 3: Ripples, Episode 4: Burning Bridges and Episode 5: Checkmate impacting the trajectory of the story. Coupled with the introduction of its RPG mechanics, The Council left a lasting impression after its opening episode came to an end. That doesnt mean that The Mad Ones did not come without its flaws, though. There were visible cracks in the first episode, from voice acting and writing to technical issues and frame rate, that would continue to deepen and undo Big Bads potential in creating a standout hit of 2018.Players step into the role of Louis de Richet, who is both a member and the heir to the secret society known as the Golden Order. His mother, Sarah Faustine de Richet, is the leader of the Golden Order. The Council quickly establishes the mother-son dynamic at the heart of the narrative  for the early stages at least  with the opening segment focusing on the two being held captive after they tried to steal a book, Al Azif. While the Al Azif is introduced in The Mad Ones, it becomes a small reoccurring plot point across the story. Depending on how players progress through the title, they could miss out on the opportunity to find the book again. Louis main story arc begins to take shape when he arrives on a private island off the shores of England in 1793, following on from the disappearance of his mother. Its here where players eventually cross paths with Lord William Mortimer, the mysterious figure who is inviting world leaders, diplomats and influential people to the island for a secretive meeting. While the different mysteries slowly begin to unravel, The Council takes a massive swing in direction when the mother-son relationship no longer becomes the main crux of the story and the daemon theme takes center stage. Big Bad took a bold move of drastically shifting the storys direction, but rather than keeping the daemon element at arms length and using it to complement other themes, The Councils storytelling can easily lose most players interest in Checkmate. For the developer, however, the story remains balanced in terms of its pacing. Just like many episodic titles on the market, it feels consistent for how each episode focuses on a particular plot point while subplots are worked into the framework of the story. Louis adventure, above anything else, is made memorable for the opportunity to interact with The Councils wide-ranging cast of characters. Its even more effective for how historical figures, from George Washington to Napoleon Bonaparte, are incorporated with the characters the developer created for the title. Emily Hillsborrow, for example, is a complex character that players will regularly find themselves conversing with over the course of the story. Theres a reason to feel invested in her relationship with Louis and the other characters, along with discovering more about her secrets and the reason for why she is on the island. The Council, however, does suffer from poor writing and voice acting. Facial animations dont match up during conversations, which can leave characters looking in different directions when they are talking with each other. Its also difficult to feel any raw emotion during surprising moments in an episode, especially when the subpar writing and voice acting doesnt do the characters the justice that they deserved.Gameplay is the one area where The Council excelled in across all five episodes. Players have an early taste of the RPG mechanics the moment that they are able to choose from one of three classes for Louis: Diplomat, Occultist or Detective. Each class comes with its pros and cons, of course, but Big Bad makes a brilliant decision to allow players to unlock different abilities across all three classes. Thats right, it can leave players to experiment with different skills that they want to improve and utilize the ones that will benefit them the most over the course of the story. In fact, its even better when it has been balanced to the point where Louis never feels overpowered in a certain situation. Players will want to complete mini-tasks and challenges to earn as much experience points as possible, helping their character to level up and to reap the benefits of doing so in their playthroughs of The Council. There is also a reason to explore the island and Mortimers manor, specifically to scavenge items to replenish a players effort points after they have used them for one of their skills. Its combined with the opportunity to pick up manuscripts littered across The Council, which can improve different abilities in Louis skill tree. Big Bad, unlike some developers, deserves complete praise for when it comes to shaking up the RPG mechanics with the introduction of Louis Thoughts Readings ability in Burning Bridges. Yes, in the penultimate episode of The Council, the studio is willing to hand players a new feature that refreshes the experience. In hindsight, its a little bit of a shame that Thoughts Readings wasnt introduced in Ripples, giving players more hands-on time with the ability. When it comes to standout features, however, its difficult to not spotlight the Social Influence system and Confrontation. Louis interaction with almost every character allows players to identify immunities and vulnerabilities thanks to the Social Influence feature. It never makes a segment feel dull, especially when it is combined with Confrontation. Big Bad places players into a verbal head-to-head showdown with important characters across all episodes, raising the tension when it comes to picking the right answer in gaining an advantage over Louis opponent. Early on in The Council, theres room to make errors and still have the chance of winning a Confrontation. That doesnt last long, though, especially as the developer will throw a curveball and players have only one chance in getting all of the answers right. With multiple endings to unlock, different pathways to explore and the option to start the story with a certain class, The Council might be the only episodic title where replay value is well worth a players time.Its important to make this point as clear as day: The Council is blighted with technical issues. Really, it cannot be understated how much it impacted the whole experience across the title. Glitches are an ever-present problem in each episode, especially when it showed how flawed the title was in this one aspect alone. In Ripples, for example, there was a moment where players could stumble across Johann Christoph von Wllners lifeless body on the floor of a balcony. Players could also find different characters stuck in weird animations after interacting with them. Its honestly hard for players to make their way through The Council without running into a certain issue. Big Bads title also suffers from frame rate issues, especially when it comes to Louis running animation. It can be a frustrating experience that will leave some players choosing to walk with the character rather than allowing the frame rate to drop so badly. Closing Comments:The Council might have stumbled its way across the finishing line in Checkmate, but thats not enough to take the shine off of the title. Okay, its story descended into chaos when the daemon theme began to unravel and hindered the storytelling potential, but that should not be a reason to stop playing The Council. Gameplay is far more superior to any other episodic title on the market, with Big Bad sending an important message to other developers that this aspect should never be overlooked in episodic gaming. From the opening moments of The Mad Ones, its clear as day that the RPG mechanics would bring forward an engaging experience over the story. The developer didnt hold back from introducing a new mechanic in the later stage of the title and it seamlessly worked in harmony with the features that have been there since the opener. While it doesnt boast mind-blowing visuals or sounds, The Council has a simple art direction that makes it feel right at home in the period that it takes place. Despite all of the praise, technical issues and frame rate problems have shackled Big Bads potential with The Council. When Hardcore Gamer spoke to The Council director Sylvain Sechi last year, he admitted that the studio would be open to the idea of a sequel. The IP is broad and we have many things to tell, he explained. Should Big Bad iron out the issues that it faced in The Council, a sequel could be a true redemption story for the developer. But for now, The Council is still a must-play title for any fan of episodic gaming.", "date": "January 25, 2019", "grade": 3.5}
