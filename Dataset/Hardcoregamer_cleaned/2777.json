{"name": "Pineapple Smash Crew", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=2249", "text": "Sometimes its good to be simple. Sometimes all you want to do it lay waste to the aliens and robots that have overrun a spaceship with a four-man crew who work together like a well-oiled machine, concentrating massive firepower at anything dumb enough to get in the way. While careful loadout management and correct attribution of skill points into the most effective perks are certainly fun, theres also something to be said for letting a grenade do all the heavy thinking. In Pineapple Smash Crew, the hardest choice is which grenade to use to complement your guns.Pineapple Smash Crew is a four-man group of space marine-type soldiers blasting their way through the ruined hulks of creature-infested space ships. While the primary goal is a throwaway task (kill all monsters in a room, find the relics, or destroy toxic barrels), the secondary goal is to get to the computer room and download the info necessary to eventually find the big gold spaceship. Both of these are just a cheap excuse to plow through endless random rooms filled with alien bugs and bots. Pineapple Smash Crew is pure arcade shooting from beginning to end, and complicated mission structures arent part of that formula. So, with enemy smushing being the order of the day, thered better be some top-notch shooting going on, and Pineapple Smash Crew does a pretty good job of it. Your team sticks together and acts as a single unit, concentrating firepower on a single point. If a member gets left behind by being stuck on a wall or behind a door, he quickly teleports back into the fight, so theres no fiddling around trying to keep the guys together. Each team member has his own individual health bar, and can carry a single grenade, and you can switch between them with the touch of a button to get the right member for the job up front.", "date": "March 19, 2012", "grade": 3.5}
