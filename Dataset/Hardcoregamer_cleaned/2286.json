{"name": "Insurgency", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=71867", "text": "Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat was a free multiplayer first person shooter mod for Valves Source Engine that was released on Steam back in 2007. The mod placed an emphasis on realism and teamwork, and cultivated a loyal fan-base of dedicated players. Indie developer New World Interactive, which consists of members of the original mod team, has brought the concept back, now as a standalone game simply titled Insurgency. Despite a failed a kickstarter campaign back in 2012, the game has now made it to full release on Steam. The core fundamentals of what Insurgency aims to be are very similar to those of the original mod. The games prime focus is to provide a realistic portrayal of modern combat with objective based gameplay and an emphasis on teamwork, and in that respect it is a success. The obvious aspect of Insurgency that really lends to the realistic feel and distinguishes it from most other multiplayer shooters is the damage model. Weapon damage is handled much more realistically than most other shooters, meaning a single shot will more often than not be enough to kill you. This gives the game an outstanding sense of urgency and brings the need for careful and tactical play to the forefront.Complimenting the tension the fragility of your character provides, the majority of the game modes in Insurgency feature either limited or no respawns, so staying alive is of paramount importance. On the topic of modes, the game has good variety of different game types, though interestingly there is no deathmatch. The standout mode is firefight, which is a mix of last team standing and a territory capture mode. The goal of this mode is to either capture all three territories on the map or eliminate the entire enemy team. The twist is that every time you capture a territory all your teammates respawn. This gives the mode an outstanding intensity, where the tide can turn in the blink of an eye. We had instances where only a single teammate remained against overwhelming odds, but he managed to capture a territory and bring our entire time back into the fight, suddenly shifting the odds back into our favor. Rounds in this mode can be very brief or last quite a while, with hard swings and a tug-of-war feeling to the back and forth nature of the mode.Not all of the modes are as unique as firefight, but even the ones that are typical FPS game types are enjoyable due to the tactical gameplay and solid weapon handling. Weapon handling is one of those intangible things in shooters that can be hard to quantify, but you know when it feels it right, and it definitely feels right in Insurgency. The game has absolutely phenomenal sound effects that give the weapons a satisfying punch when you fire, but its also little things that really stand out, like the subtle and believable way the weapon sways while you move. Recoil also feels just right, and the different types of weapons all sound and feel different. Having weapons that are enjoyable to fire is one of the most important aspects of a first person shooter, and Insurgency completely nails it.When looking at the core pillars of what makes a multiplayer shooter great, youve got the actual shooting mechanics, the game modes, and the maps you play them on, and unfortunately Insurgency isnt quite as strong in the latter department as it is in the two preceding areas. The game features a decent number of maps, but none come across as being especially memorable, and too often they are hard to even tell apart. The majority of the maps take place in urban middle eastern environments, and overall just feel too similar. Visually, the game isnt super impressive, possessing that distinctive look of the source engine in terms of environments and geometry. It isnt just that the maps are visually unimpressive, but that they dont feel as thoughtfully designed as some other games. The maps seem to be designed to appear like realistic locations more than as arenas for gameplay to take place in. Thats certainly a valid approach, but often there will be rooms that feel pointless and paths that seem as though they should be passable but arent. The maps dont hurt the game all that much, as the other aspects of the game are very good, but they could be better.These days, the majority of multiplayer shooters feature customizable loadouts and a persistent leveling system, but Insurgency takes a different approach. Instead of having weapons that are unlocked through the course of play, you have all equipment and weapons available from the outset. When a match first begins, you choose a class, but there are only a certain amount per team. Each team consists of two squads which each have a set of classes to choose from (determined by the game mode). Once a player selects a class, it is claimed and cant be selected by anyone else. Once you select a class, you will start with a set loadout, but you have the opportunity to customize if you so choose. Each class has access to specific weapons and equipment, which each have a point value associated with them. Everyone starts with the same amount of points, which gives you the freedom to customize without sacrificing game balance.Its not just that the game doesnt tie the loadout system in with player progression, but that it doesnt have any form of player progression at all. Some purists may be in favor of this, distilling the game down to gameplay and forgoing all the carrot on a stick external hooks, but many are going to find the lack of any persistence disappointing. Lacking a pointless number next to your name that goes up just for playing isnt a huge loss, but the game doesnt have any form of stat tracking or ranking system whatsoever, which is a kind of expected at this point. The lack of persistence is just one of the ways in which Insurgency feels a bit dated. Another, and a fundamental issue with the game, is that there is no easy way to play with your friends. The game doesnt have any sort of party system or friends list integration. If you want to play with friends you are going to have to find a server with enough space to get everyone in and then scramble around trying to get everyone on the same team. Its a minor inconvenience, but one youre going to have to deal with every single match if you plan on playing with friends.Closing Comments:", "date": "January 29, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
