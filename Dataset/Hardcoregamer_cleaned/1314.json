{"name": "Superbeat: Xonic", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=176757", "text": "Fans of portable rhythm games are probably familiar with a game developer by the name of Pentavision. Although they created a variety of games, they were best known for the excellent rhythm series DJMax. We didnt receive every release, but what we did get was enough to plant people firmly in Pentavisions camp as lifelong fans. Unfortunately, publisher NeoWiz eventually (and quite unceremoniously) ended the series after the release of DJMax Technika Q. With such a skilled team of developers, it only made sense that theyd reform under a new banner and keep producing the kinds of titles they love. Thats exactly what developer Nurijoy have done with Superbeat: Xonic.With past Pentavision members on staff, it was easy to believe their pedigree would carry through to another excellent music game. Sure, it couldnt be quite like DJMax or its Technika iterations, but there are all sorts of gameplay methods available to the genre. So, what did they end up creating? Well, its different from their past work in a variety of ways  some of which may distance past fans while also drawing in new players. The basics of gameplay are as follows. Notes appear at the center of the screen and slowly (or quickly) radiate out to the edges of the screen. Once in alignment with the button press radius on the left and right of the screen you must push them. The better your timing, the better your score. Of course, failing to hit enough notes will ensure youre graded quite harshly afterward. Theres nothing much new or exciting about the formula of timed button pressing, of course. Nearly every rhythm game features the same concept. Its the execution which Nurijoy have taken their best stab at shaking up with the types of notes youre hitting. There are multiple difficulty modes, with each increasing level adding in more buttons to hit. The first mode, 4TRAX, despite its name, actually features 10 potential buttons to hit in four areas of the Vita screen. First are the regular buttons which simply require a tap at the right time in either the bottom right, top right, top left, or bottom left quadrant. Then there are buttons which require an on-screen flick or analog stick push up or down on both the right and left sides of the screen. Finally, there is a hold note which requires either continued touching on screen or pulling an analog stick up or down to follow the line. Once youve mastered this mode you can hop onto one of the six modes which adds two more quadrants: middle left and middle right. As you might expect, this adds a lot more excitement to Superbeat: Xonic, but it takes a while to build up to it. Thats because 4TRAX mode alone gets pretty tough once you work through songs with higher difficulty settings. Playing via buttons exclusively is especially tough, as it can be downright challenging to keep your mind in the mindset of rapidly switching back and forth between buttons/d-pad and analog sticks for buttons in the same lanes. This is one game that benefits from Vitas touch screen because it really cuts down on these mixed mental button-pressing signals. While the gameplay is totally functional, this isnt the only key factor for a rhythm game. It also needs to have a kicking soundtrack to make people want to keep playing over and over again. Thats where Superbeat: Xonic gets a bit murky. There are some great songs in the mix, but overall the list of available music is not a home run. The soundtrack is similar to how Beatmania and DJMax handle things by offering up a wide breadth of genres, but it seems that variety was focused on over quality. This is subjective, sure, but the end result is that no one will be fully pleased with the representation of their favored musical genres. What happens when youre left playing a music game when youre not fond of the tracks? It ends up dragging. Theres simply little compelling reason to keep playing after youve run through and unlocked all the songs to hear them through at least once. Its possible to keep grinding up your DJ level or attempt to get perfect scores on tracks, but none of that really means anything (unless youre addicted to leaderboards). Theres even a World Tour mode which offers a variety of predetermined songs with specific win conditions to complete. While this could have been fun, it ends up being an annoyance too. After all, the win conditions are often very similar and even after you complete them youre still forced to wade through the entire setlist. Beyond that, theres little else for players to get wrapped up in.Even the visuals during play fail to inspire. Instead of offering up totally random little videos as is common for both Beatmania and DJMax, were mostly left with thematic colors and patterns in the background. Even if it can be argued that its hard to focus on the videos in other rhythm game anyway, it still feels like there is a distinct lack of effort put into things when theres merely some pulsating colors going on behind the gameplay. Somehow, despite the decreased focus on musical flair, theres still a fair amount of instances when youll lose track of a note because it blends in with the background more than it should. Closing Comments: Superbeat: Xonic is obviously a very inspired title. It oozes style on every menu, but fails to imbue the actual gameplay with a compelling reason to keep playing. When compared to other Vita rhythm games, theres little which would make most players opt for this over DJMax Technika or even Persona 4: Dancing All Night. The former has a much greater songlist and replay value, while Persona 4 carries with it similar gameplay with a recognizable cast and tracklist. Superbeat: Xonic is lacking all that. While gameplay at the core is functional and multilayered, most wont find themselves excited to play over and over again.", "date": "November 12, 2015", "grade": 3.0}
