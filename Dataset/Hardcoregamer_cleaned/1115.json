{"name": "Bravely Second: End Layer", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=196776", "text": "Bravely Default in 2013  or 2014 for the Yanks was another one of those wonderful and exuberant examples of a game wherein even the most minor and/or meager of moments, in combination, come together to form something profoundly remarkable on reflection. Its no surprise that RPGs have tended to fill my particular memory banks more so than most genres in recent times. Much like how Fire Emblem: Awakening appeared  arguably reinvigorating, as much saving, the franchise  almost out of nowhere, Bravely Default was an unashamed love-letter to past 16-bit titles, yet still came off fresh enough to feel future-proof and brimming with personality. Whats more, as if custom-tailored to even the most apathetic but despondent of individualsi.e. methese types of games generated in us a feeling of escape. Of being able to switch off from the World for a few hours at a given time and bask in the adventure unfolding and the characters presented to us  in all their gloriously blissful/naive/charming/comedic detail.Two years later and Bravely Second: End Layer finds us transported back into the World of Luxendarc where peace  the warring factions having put their differences aside and on the verge of making their truce permanent  has been but a temporary halt. Plunged as we are, literally straight into a new adventure, Bravely Second reunites us with old faces while introducing new ones along the way  a fitting signal Square Enixs intentions are to approach the sequel with as much the care and consideration so clearly portrayed on initial presentation. Whether it be the hand-drawn storybook-like vista of towns and locales, or the way interiors and even cutscenes play out as if performed on a stage, like its predecessor, Bravely Second hits all the right nostalgic notes with its art direction without feeling stiff or coming across as disjointedly misplaced. Even the more isometrically-viewed interiors and dungeon layouts scattered throughout only flesh out Seconds warming aesthetic of which mixes the traditional with the fantastical. Of steampunk-esque machinery and rather less scientific leanings on magic and sorcery.Yet Bravely Second goes beyond simply borrowing from these established bases and/or looking like a piece of acted out entertainment, in capturing that whimsical and canny sense of joy RPGs aspire to generate and only occasionally pull off. The fact Seconds story  which seldom shies away from the go-to formula of bold heroes, cunning villains and a grand unfolding tale  and narrative comes off as self-aware, knowing in of itself from where and whom it borrows from, only reinforces the series position as a clever balance between high-stake adventure and satirical comedy. Whether it be the character dialogue (lead-protagonist Yew Geneolgias back-and-forth between bold leader and hapless novice is sufficient enough to enjoy) or even the occasional breaking of the forth wall, like Default before it, Bravely Second is gallantly sound in its timing. The characters too are presented, if not in some complex or emotionally-tangled stance, with a pleasant array and enough interaction to make conversations feel lively and engaging. Though there are some questionably lengthy stretches of dialogue  some characters, good and bad, even appearing to force through some degree of a catchphrase or humour, to lesser success  the narrative progresses with just enough a gracious pace, players will rarely find themselves dumbfounded by whats happening on screen. Or rather, both screens.But its the gameplay where Bravely Second, as much its predecessor, rightly shines and while on the surface little has changed, the series now-staple Brave/Default mechanics seldom get tiresome or dull. For anyone not clued up on the system present, Bravely Seconds combat primarily revolves around its two-state choice of stances: Brave or Default. At the start of every battle, both player-characters and enemies/monsters are equipped with Battle Points (BP) which dictates the amount of actions both sides can take during their turn. Players can decide to enter either Brave or Default state with both options incurring potential critical repercussions  good and bad  on the battle as a whole. Default puts players in a defensive stance but allows them to bank points to add on to later turns. Brave, on the otherhand, acts like a temporary loan of sorts in which players can rack several actions to a given turn by borrowing from successive rounds. This ultimately affects your total BP count and having it fall under 0 incurs a pass on your turn. A new feature making its debut is the titular Second mode which freezes enemies in place and allows players a free run of actions for a limited time. Said limits eventually builds up again overtime once drained based on real-time play and in order to use it again, players can either wait for the required time to pass or bypass the wait by physically purchase access to the Second ability again.While all this may sound relatively simple in concept, Bravely Second follows in Defaults shoes in that it opens up so many possibilities in how combined weapon traits, skills, conditions etc. can potentially play out in-game. Much like similarly playful takes on turn-based gameplay like Child of Lights time-based decision-making (itself a possible leaning to Final Fantasys Active Time Battle system), its the type of emergent gameplay that rewards experimentation but never fails to remind players of the potential risks afoot. Needless to say, theres little tension or excitement lost mid-battle and coupled with Seconds refined Jobs structure  taking the form of asterisks, acquired after beating bosses and/or completing optional side-quests  this opens up a wider array of customisation to ones strategy and tactics. Thus, jobs are another of the series key yet charming and cleverly-managed premises.The ability to switch a characters abilities on the fly means theres even more room to experiment and try out new possibilities. The fact Job classes have their own points bar alongside regular XP  thus, characters with little-to-no experience of one particular asterisk will be required to build themselves up from the first level again  means earlier enemy encounters become relevant again in due course and while this may at times devolve into additional grinding, it means the overall game and its varying locales can be revisited and relevant to the players overarching experience. Further to this, given each Job class has its own perks and weapon stats  not to mention they can be tagged alongside already-equipped states and be used in conjunction with other abilities  it gives players further room to get past the vast array of enemy types found throughout, each with their own unique offensive properties and strengths/weaknesses.Of course, players can choose to avoid most (though not all) enemy engagement by way of fine-tuning the encounter probability in open play from a 100% increase in random encounters, all the way down to a 100% reduction. Doing so  as the game makes sure to call out  significantly reduces the opportunity to level up and its this ingenious way in which custom-tailoring the experience is put firmly in the players hands, is why it  like so many other customisable options  stands out so well. Do you go through the necessary moments of enemy encounters, helpful items at the ready, in order to get stronger? Or do you decide to cut all that out, but run the risk of coming to one of the games many bosses under-levelled and under-classed to progress? Its a fine balance the player needs to make and ask themselves, but its what makes Bravely Second a fascinating experience to conquer as much get immersed in.Other seemingly-insignificant design choices such as instant access to the games many menus by a simple tap of the D-Pad or the well-designed interfaces, despite their complexity, only add to the growing praise on the way Silicon Studio have managed to successfully jam-pack a portable game with so much to look and see and read, without densifying the actual process as a result. There are no mathematical probabilities or superficially deep inclusions for such things like status effects. Weapon X is stronger in Case Y but not in Scenario Zand so on. Silicon & Square Enixs recognition for ease-of-use is never lost and its a welcome return to find this notable practice in the sequel, both in and out of the main quest. But there are no greater so simpleand yet moments in Bravely Second, than the notable Chompcraft mini-game of sorts that players can take up at any time, upon unlock, for the simple pleasure of unwinding. Not since fishing in Ocarina of Time have I found a few minutes stretch into a full half-hour as players watch the four main protagonists work together to make cute-looking wool-stuffed toys.Such moments are often so daft and so meaningless in the wider scope of things, yet its surprisingly addictive and just-as-surprisingly deep given its array of upgradeable perks and cleverly strategic pull to continue playing. The ability to upgrade the games so-called Lunar Base will also tug at the heartstrings of those help build until full completion types out there who are as much about seeing everything done to completion, as they are getting the inevitable rewards by way of new skill unlocks and unique abilities. Again, Bravely Second compels in ways that feel initially insignificant and/or easily ignored, but all it does is exemplify Bravelys returning core philosophy on combining personal charm upfront with engaging gameplay close behind.Closing Comments:To make a fittingly Nintendo-affiliated comparison, Bravely Second: End Layer is to the 3DS what Bayonetta 2 was to the Wii U: a sequel with its own respectable amount of anticipation that, while offering little by way of drastic change, delivers more than enough fresh and returning moments to remind us all (new and veteran players alike) why such a release struck an immeasurable chord in the first place. Bravely Second is without question another memorable, worthwhile and undeniably essential play for anyone striving to get their latest RPG fix. And what better way to do it with a game (and a series) that takes from the glory days of the SNES and gels it wonderfully with a continually-enticing and fully-rewarding battle system that rarely gets old or falls victim to stagnation. But with the return of its elegantly-drawn art-style, its humble aesthetic and joyfully self-aware attitude, Bravely Second marks itself a perfect follow-up to one of handheld gamings most beloved debuts  the sequel now standing proudly as another rightly-billed essential in the 3DS library.", "date": "March 9, 2016", "grade": 4.5}
