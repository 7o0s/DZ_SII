{"name": "Harold", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=135731", "text": "Harold is far and away one of the most beautiful games Ive ever played. Its character design and animation can go toe-to-toe with anything made with Ubi-art and its gorgeously-animated backgrounds wouldnt look out of place in a feature film. This isnt exactly surprising, given who made it  Moon Spider Studio is an indie development house founded by former employees of EA, Ignition Entertainment, Dreamworks Animation and Studio Ghibli. Of course, we all know Ghiblis reputation, but the Dreamworks talent is arguably more impressive. Before Dreamworks transitioned to 3D animation exclusively, they made four of the most breathtaking films in the history of traditional animation. The influence of those films  in particular Prince of Egypt and Road to El Dorado  shines through in every frame of Harolds gameplay. Unfortunately, the influence of EA and Ignition isnt nearly as obvious.I dont mean to imply that Harold isnt well-designed. By all rights it has a brilliant concept: you play as Gabriel, a guardian angel in training whose final test is to help a weak, near-useless runner named Harold win a globe-spanning race. Instead of controlling Harold directly, you use your angelic powers to move obstacles and clear a path for him, occasionally hitting him with lightning to make him jump or run faster.The combination of Canabalt-inspired auto-running and Lemmings-style environment manipulation is ingenious and deceptively challenging. Adjusting obstacles for Harold while controlling his speed and jumping feels a bit like trying to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time, and every new stage is more devious and complex than the last.When Harold is going full pelt and overtaking the other runners, it feels glorious. Your twirls of the analog stick and carefully-timed button presses turn the world into a well-oiled machine, opening up for Harold and snapping shut on his opponents. As he runs, a gospel choir sings his praises, getting louder with each step he takes forward and cutting out whenever he stumbles. In this it feels almost like a rhythm game, and the input sequences youll have to hit to maintain top speed are as complex as any lick you might play in Guitar Hero. Perfectionists can have a field day with this game, committing every last level to muscle memory and trying over and over to improve their times. The game does give you a chance to get the timing down for each obstacle before the race proper begins. In practice mode you run through the obstacles individually, collecting stars by putting Harold on an ideal path and maintaining top speeds. If you can collect all of the stars in a given practice session youll earn extra puff power, which serves as both your life counter and your resource for boosting Harolds speed.On top of that, each level has multiple paths (not unlike the levels in Sonic), and collecting all of the stars teaches you how to reach the most efficient route. There are even shortcuts hidden in every level that can send Harold flying to the front of the pack, though they can be tricky to activate.But games like this only work when theyre finely tuned, and at times Harold feels just a little too loose for comfort. The feature-quality character animations look phenomenal, but the way they squash and stretch can make Harolds hitbox a little tough to decipher, and the build-up on certain actions is just long enough to feel a bit unresponsive. The UI creates problems as well. Gabes angelic powers are represented as ethereal blue-white clouds, which can be difficult to see on certain backgrounds  the Jungle and Desert environments are dense with green and yellow, but both the Arctic and Beach areas make heavy use of baby blue and the icons can get lost there. Its also tough to tell at a glance when Harolds puff power boost has run out, which can mean doom if hes coming up on a particularly long jump.These are all things that players can get used to, though. The bigger problem is that occasionally the controls just dont work. Sometimes Gabes powers wont activate at all, leaving Harold to crash into an obstacle and respawn. Other times the powers will appear to be working, but no matter how often you flick the analog stick the icicle or wall youre trying to destroy wont budge. When these bugs crop up theyll often repeat themselves every time you restart a race, meaning you have to quit out and reload the whole thing. These problems dont happen frequently enough to ruin the fun, but they do put a damper on it  especially if youre a perfectionist aiming to come first in every race. Closing Comments:For all its problems, Harold isnt without its charms. The music is fantastic, especially when it kicks into high gear and the whole choir starts singing. It doesnt have much in the way of a story, but the simple character arcs of Gabe and his rival Sera have a certain anime-esque appeal, and the scenes of Harold bumbling his way into last place at the start of each race are funny in a very Looney Tunes sorta way. The gameplay itself is complex and enjoyable, but the lack of consistency in the controls will drive more hardcore players nuts. Still, its almost worth buying for the gorgeous art and animation alone, and I cant deny that it put a smile on my face.", "date": "February 23, 2015", "grade": 3.5}
