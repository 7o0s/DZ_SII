{"name": "Pale Echoes", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=186158", "text": "Due to the increasing amount of tools available to ease the game making process, the market has become flooded with a glut of titles. It becomes so difficult to tell the good from the bad, especially with the smaller ones, that it becomes common to dismiss entire swaths of games based purely on what was used. The familiar Unity logo brings about shudders in the discerning gamer. Its ease of use has led to too many subpar offerings cluttering the marketplace. RPGMaker titles have similarly burned too many people, leaving honest devs just trying to put forth a good title, but lacking the cash to license something without a stigma, struggling for its audience to give them a look. Wyrmling Productions Pale Echoes is one of the latter titles, and one that is deserving of said chance.The story centers around the last remaining human, Schorl, traveling the post-apocalyptic wasteland in an attempt to rebuild a new future. Together, with his saerii (read: faerie) companion, they visit the blasted lands to cleanse them of echoes, pained spirits of the past. Purifying these echoes changes the land from a desert hellscape to the lush green environments of yore. Cleansing these echoes brings forth an interesting aspect of the systems in place. For one, this is an RPG with no experience point system. Schorl only gains strength through traveling to the past through gateways to collect memories. These memories are then employed in battle as attacks that can be used only one time per encounter. Should the player run out of memories, the fight is lost. Fortunately, smart play prevents this from becoming an issue. Most memories possess an affinity related to emotions. These are color coded, allowing battles to take on a rock, paper, scissors type function. While this is a simple concept, it manages to be effective. Battles often provide the chance to effect the enemies mood to lower their resistance to certain attacks. Keeping track of what memories are left in the arsenal becomes crucial to winning the engagement.The conceit of purifying the haunted lands also allows the battles to be forgiving. Instead of a life meter, Schorl has focus. Should he lose his focus, he will only be pushed back a couple of steps, allowing the player to retry the battle immediately. This becomes useful for instances where something unexpected occurs. For example, when fighting one boss, she begins to shed snake enemies. These managed to wipe me out the first time as I was not able to plan for them. Being able to jump right back to it allowed me to trigger the snakes again and follow up with a multiple target attack, rending the situation a non-issue.In addition to the purification encounters, Pale Echoes makes heavy use of traversal puzzles. As mentioned before, Schorl can travel to the past through gateways. Here, he might be able to cross a bridge that had fallen to ruin, crossing back on the other side. These gateways are in pre-planned places, though. It is not possible to simply cast a spell at whim. This leads to instances of popping back and forth through time to find a way around to the primary echo in a realm. These sequences are actually quite clever, though missing the accidental incest aspects of other time travelling adventures. Later in the game, activating a gateway requires the sacrifice of a memory. This forces the player to make some strategic decisions regarding what to give up in order to progress. While this would render the game more difficult, the actual battles are all pre-planned. It is not possible to stumble into an unwinnable situation. That, coupled with the fact that there will always be a fresh supply of new memories to the player who explores for a couple of minutes, almost defangs the decision. Still, given the choice of being able to paint oneself into a corner or being able to progress and enjoy the story, the correct decision was made.Not all is rosy with Pale Echoes, though. There are a couple of quibbles to address. First, and most aggravating, it is only possible to play this game in a very small window. Sure, blowing up the 16-bit style graphics to widescreen might reduce the quality of the art, but so does squinting. The strange sense of claustrophobia this brought about was unpleasant. There is also the matter of keyboard only controls. Due to the low specs and engrossing story of this game, laptop play is a natural way to go. I tend to use my laptop in my recliner, cat on my feet. Not being able to use the mouse to click and direct detracted from the experience as a whole. The kitty wasnt happy, either. Admittedly, this is a personal preference based on the games style, and thus is not a factor in the score. Finally, some might balk at the games short length. It was precisely as long as it needed to be, but people wanting longer playtimes will be disappointed.Closing Comments:Pale Echoes manages to be a pleasant surprise. Not only does the story intrigue, it does so with an interesting battle system. Schorl takes his journey while packing interesting ideas and fun puzzles. Its not a normal RPG and sheds many of the expected elements found there. In doing so, it manages to craft a unique adventure that is absolutely worth experiencing. While the screen size issue does detract, anyone looking for something different would do well to give this a shot.", "date": "Bohn on January 8, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
