Eschatos isnt shy about crowding the screen with enemies and bullets, but it does it with its own style more in line with a game like Raiden or Truxton, except with a camera that swoops and dives through cinematic transitions when the occasion dictates. Its a fantastic ride and incredibly fun shooter.The paper-thin plot is roughly three words long- Aliens! Shoot em! Flying saucers have settled over the city and dropped an endless supply of giant ants and spiders drones and minibosses in its skies. As the pilot of a space-capable fighter plane its up to you to clear the alien menace away and take the fight back to the mothership, which is really all the excuse you need to get shot to bits on the way there. While Eschatos initially defaults to Easy when choosing between Original and Advanced modes (with Time Attack having a preset difficulty level), bumping things up quickly makes the attacking strings of enemies a bullet-spewing force worth taking seriously.The three modes all travel the same course but have slightly different play mechanics. Original starts off with the player ship at full power, and dying wont change that. The carrier drones that drop power-ups only have one type of cargo, which is the Flash item. Picking it up uses it instantly, clearing the screen of bullets and damaging all enemies on screen, like a bomb you cant stockpile. In fact there are no bombs in Eschatos, which means you need to concentrate on shooting, dodging, and shielding. The ship has two firing modes of straight and spread, you can switch between the two with different fire buttons, and the shield can be activated either by a third button or holding both fire buttons at once. The Original mode keeps things simple with maxed-out fire and a nice supply of Flash opportunities, and Advanced is where things start getting strategic. Advanced plays more like what youd expect from a shooter, in that the gun starts weak and the carriers drop gun powerups as well as the Flash items. Its the shield usage where the scoring opportunities start kicking in, though, because in addition to blocking bullets it also converts them into bonus points. The shield is limited-use, and the more you power up the gun the smaller its meter gets, so scoring becomes an interesting balance. It also doesnt help that the Flash items now drop the gun by a power level, but at seven levels its usually not too bad to drop by one. The way the gameplay tends to break up is Original mode is nice for practice while Advanced is where you go once youre ready for the full challengeThe third mode, Time Attack, plays a bit differently. You start with 90 seconds on the clock and each death subtracts 5, while beating bosses adds a varying amount of time. The base gameplay is built off Normal mode, but the difficulty ramps up quick. Lives are infinite but only so long as you have the time to spend them, and while the added time bonus from bosses is generous the later levels can chew through lives at great speed. Even if you can clear the final boss, though, a good spot on the online leaderboard requires speed rather than score.All these modes are only impressive if the game is any fun, though, and Eschatos easily holds its own with that requirement. While the texture-work is noticeably low-budget, the art direction easily makes up for it as do its numerous and creative set pieces. The camera swoops and soars as the ship changes its trajectory, although the wildest changes are constrained to brief cut-scenes. The popcorn enemy designs tend toward the simple but how ornate does a bobbling flying saucer need to be? The really big bosses get the best designs, all chrome and purple, and frequently take several stages of shooting to defeat while strings of smaller enemies support them. Add in a barrage of firepower and some changes in camera angle and the encounters feel wonderfully epic. Closing Comments:Eschatos is a truly fantastic vertical shooter, filled with memorable set-pieces and shooting action that never settles down. The need to switch between wide and forward shots while balancing shield use means theres always a decision to be made outside of how do I get out of the way?, and its cinematic approach to the flow of action means that each stage moves organically from one scenario to another. Theres something satisfying about being able to track the journey from flying over a city, to a pyramid, then into the skies and outer space as the alien homeworld waits for your arrival, and it never gets in the way of the classic vertical shooting setup. Theres even a progression of options opening up the more you play, adding more credits and other back-end functions over time. Eschatos merges the classic vertical shooter with a modern style of action while avoiding bullet hell, making for a fast, accessible and incredibly fun dose of pure arcade goodness.", "date": "September 26, 2015", "grade": 4.0}
