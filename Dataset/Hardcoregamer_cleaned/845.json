{"name": "Dear Esther: Landmark Edition", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=227135", "text": "For a variety of reasons, the genre of walking simulators has been a divisive one amongst internet communities, forming a love it or hate it vibe for this relatively new category of games. While some players are perfectly content with the peaceful and reflective gameplay and stories these titles have to offer, a vocal portion have decreed these experiences as non-games, due to their common lacking of any sort of objective-based gameplay beyond exploration and completion. Despite this alienating aspect, these types of games have still managed to form a cult following, with fans consistently singing the praises of these games to any and all who will listen. One of the earlier and more infamous examples of this genre is Dear Esther, which began its life on PC as a Half-Life mod in 2007, until it got remade into a full title five years later by The Chinese Room. With an updated version being released on consoles and PC known as the Landmark Edition, Dear Esther will once again appear in the publics eye, as the titles well-written but event-less plot is bolstered by an engrossing soundtrack and a handful of new features, despite unimpressive graphics for a mostly bland setting.Dear Esthers core story is told through the narration of letters directed towards the titular Esther by a vague narrator, who constantly switches between the personas of a dying man and the games central location, an uninhabited and nameless island deep with history. The player-characters identity and motivations are just as mysterious, and are made even less clear during the games powerful and dark final chapter, which represents one of the few sections of the story that are capable of investing the player. The story is exceedingly well-written, rich with creative language and descriptive imagery which benefit the games explanatory nature, with themes of precaution and regret being prominent throughout. But beyond those final twenty minutes, the narrative lacks any sort of consistent progression to accompany the players traversal through the island, instead offering hints and non-sequitur soliloquies about the inhabitants of the island that do little to encourage the player to continue towards the completion of its two hour runtime.For the most part, the experience of playing Dear Esther is pretty much what one would come to expect of the genre, aside from a few minor grievances. The players journey throughout the island features very few items with which to interact with, as all of the available buttons merely zoom in the camera to provide the player a closer look. Many of these objects are set aside as rewards for players who take the extra step while exploring, which makes the small tasks compelling nature a more personal judgement for the player, which is accompanied by the consideration of a slower than necessary walking speed for both the trip there and the more tedious backtracking back to the main path. Plenty of painted graffiti also litters the walls of the island, some of which is, apparently intentionally, difficult to read even with the proper perspective. But with so little going on on a consistent basis, the empty nature of the island starts to feel less like a feature and more like an obstacle as the game progresses.As with any port, presentation and extra features are always intriguing aspects of the more recent version of a title, and the Landmark Edition has mixed results in those two categories. While there were no bugs or frame drops throughout the playthrough, the consistently grey and blue nature of the island leaves little for the player to be visually awed by, particularly when some of the setpieces and objects within them are a little rough around the edges. The soundtrack remains as enchantingly beautiful as it first was in 2012, often doing more to stimulate emotions within the player than either the narrative or central setting. As for new features, the added crosshair offers little usage considering the aforementioned lack of interactivity, while the commentary provided by several key members of The Chinese Room development team offers plenty of intriguing insight for players eager to learn more about the title, representing the games sole reason for a second playthrough since it removes the original Dear Esther narration.Closing Comments:At its core, Dear Esther represents an exploration (or walking simulator, if thats ones preferred assessment) title for exploration fans. While it lacks the same emotional presentation of games like Journey, or the same consistently compelling narrative of games like Gone Home or The Stanley Parable, Dear Esthers exceptional writing and soundtrack help the title overcome these flaws, providing a worthwhile journey for those willing to take it. Those that are will be rewarded with a dark tale that proves that, much like the game itself, sometimes loneliness can be a powerful asset.", "date": "on September 20, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
