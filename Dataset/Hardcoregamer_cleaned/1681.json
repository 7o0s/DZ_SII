{"name": "Castle in the Darkness", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=133477", "text": "The retraux gaming movement has been going on for quite some time now, but it wasnt until 2014s Shovel Knight that we truly saw a game that didnt just aim to look like an 8-bit classic, but actually live up to that standard. Now, Castle in the Darkness throws its name into the hat with a action platformer that takes more visual cues from the 16-bit era and beyond, while keeping players on their toes and having some fun with gaming tropes along the way. The end result is a game that provides a lot of fun action and more laughter than youd expect.Some of the games best moments come from playing with conventions. Early on, a fairy is ran into who says hey, listen,but does damage when you get close. Youre also thrown some curve balls as you progress with enemies ranging from ones that release coins upon death to some that emit worms. That might not sound bad, but theyre hard to hit and can actually kill you fairly quickly. Castle in the Darkness may seem like a ball-breaking game, but its reasonably fair too. Youve got tough tests ahead of you at all times, but youre always equipped with the tools needed if you do a bit of exploring.Going off the beaten path is fairly easy to do since youll always see a large on-screen prompt letting you know theres an area you can explore. You might not be able to do much at the present time, but if a a sub-boss is defeated, you just might wind up with a new item that grants access a new area in that hidden section that nets another item. You start off with just a basic sword, but will eventually learn how to hop off crumbling bricks, smash them with an upgraded sword, buy new items, find new items and even use magic. Each item and weapon type feels different, with a charged-up fireball feeling very much like a charged-up Mega Buster blast compared to a basic boomerang attack.Risk/reward factors into things as well since more damage can be dealt with a sword slash, but theres a far greater risk of being damaged using that than a long-range attack. Long-range attacks of all types take more time to reach an enemy, however, so while theyre safer, more of them may need to be used to get the same effect. The speed and range of the attacks also must be factored in since the charged-up fireball is powerful, but medium range, while the boomerang has a long range, but a fairly low damage level compared to everything else. Theres a lot more variety here than it seems like on the surface, and it results in a more robust experience.Similarly, the RPG-influenced portions of the game help it as well. Town exploration is done in much the same vein as Castlevania II: Simons Quest, but with a far better grasp of the English language. You can heal at either a rare inn or a more-common save point. Save points are quite frequent and dont just save your game and heal you, but also act as checkpoints in case of death. Their placement can be tricky though as youll sometimes have them two screens before a boss and then have to weigh going back and risking death afterwards to backtrack and save or do you move on and taking a greater risk of facing the unknown in the hopes that you find a save point soon.Death isnt the worst thing, though. The frequent save points minimize frustration and dying fifty times nets one of the best little extras that mock the player. Access is gained to an easy mode that is its own separate little adventure in the secrets menu. Instead of attacking enemies, youll attack locks with your key blade while jumping around Super Mario Bros.-influenced areas for a short while. Its a hilarious little send-up and fits in nicely with the secrets area also containing the games original 2013 demo and other things. The classic gaming homages dont end with Mario, though, as one portion of an early area has a large Castlevania-style castle backdrop, and another later underground portion features not only an enemy that crawls along each side of a platform ala Metroid, but also a large enemy similar to a Snake Man stage enemy in Mega Man 3.Castle in the Darkness controls perfectly with a logical configuration and responsive button presses. Jumps have weight to them and theres no slide upon landing. Bounceback is minimal and never feels cheap. If youre getting hit, its because youre not taking the time to learn enemy patterns or youre rushing. Rushing when you know what your enemies will do makes no sense since it will just result in a swift death, so youre not saving any time. The key to success here is to pace yourself and treat this like it was a classic 8-bit game. It has its own rhythm, just like how both Mega Man and Castlevania had their own physics and feel, but success relied on learning the games mechanics and then applying what youve learned to the game.The game nails the retro vibe perfectly from an audio/video perspective. The chiptune soundtrack is addictive, even if it doesnt quite meet the high standards set by Shovel Knight, while the soundtrack is fun to listen to in the game and hum afterwards. Visually, a heavy 8-bit influence is blended with a level of color depth only seen in 16-bit games. Attack animations are limited, but in a good way. Like the platformers of yore, you want to be able to play and predict example how many frames an attack is and how long it takes to rattle off.Closing Comments:Castle in the Darkness knows what it wants to be and succeeds marvelously. Its a smooth-playing action platformer that meshes a variety of genres together nicely. The RPG elements fit in perfectly with the platforming and everything desired can be done at any time thanks to responsive controls. The biggest enemy here is your own natural instinct to rush through a game when your best bet is to take your time and proceed with caution. This is a must-buy platformer for anybody who either grew up on that genre as a kid or who fell in love with it again  or maybe even for the first time  with Shovel Knight.", "date": "February 9, 2015", "grade": 4.5}
