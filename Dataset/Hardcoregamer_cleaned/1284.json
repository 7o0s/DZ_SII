Games dont necessarily need bleeding edge graphics and a feature set as deep as the Marianas Trench if the core gameplay is elegant and addictive. Case in point: Tenshu General, a Risk-like real time strategy game with humble visuals and a surprisingly small number of moving parts that still manages to be entertaining. Its the very model of easy to grasp, difficult to master, and while it does have obvious limitations in depth, its a perfect little quick-match strategy game.Tenshu General is set in feudal Japan and the map is divided into provinces, each with a either a rice producing village and/or a natural feature or two such as mountains or forests. There is a home province with a Tenshu (castle) and the basic goal is to capture the opposing players Tenshu. Gameplay is fundamentally split between bolstering the rice-based economy, which provides economic resources, and creating armies of archers, infantry, and cavalry, which move around the map capturing provinces and their villages. When two opposing armies meet in a province, they clash and the winning player controls the region, at least temporarily. The economic model is pretty simple, with only three parameters: tools, water, and oxen. Each in some way contributes to the production of rice.Each player can muster up to four armies to move around the map, and the home Tenshu can be protected by walls After each battle, armies or walls must be rebuilt, which of course requires that there is a steady stream of income from the farms and villages. Natural features in a province give an economic or military advantage, so strategizing which provinces to capture on the path to the opposing Tenshu is a big part of the game. There is never a steady, fixed state. Since Tenshu General is a real time strategy game, the map is in constant flux, with control of provinces changing and armies clashing at a rapid pace. Thanks to the modest size of the maps and the relatively straightforward objectives no single match is too protracted. There is an editor so players can craft or modify their own maps. After playing through the tutorial campaign and a fair number of skirmishes, the strategic limitations of Tenshu General become apparent. The basic game play elements stay the same and while it isnt necessarily easy to achieve, a winning strategy usually consists of having strong standing armies around the map that can maintain control of the provinces and economy and eventually tip the scales.Tenshu General doesnt boast much in the way of lavish production values. Maps are simple and unadorned and the games graphics are little more than 2D icons. A little animated flag moving from province to province is as exciting as the games action ever gets. Not surprisingly, there isnt a compelling story, lush musical score, voice acting or any of the trappings of a AAA game. In fact, Tenshu General feels a lot like an iPad or mobile game. It would certainly work well in that format, and it plays well on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro. Closing Comments:Tenshu General has a strong, simple and easily-grasped rule set and addicting, fast paced, bite-sized gameplay. There arent a lot of moving pieces, but nothing is superfluous or simply there to give the appearance of depth. A little more variety in victory conditions or evolving complexity through the campaign or in skirmishes would give the game a better chance at a longer life on the hard drive.", "date": "November 28, 2015", "grade": 3.0}
