{"name": "Crash City Mayhem", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=47192", "text": "Crash City Mayhem is the definition of a bargain bin game. It was released in the most barren gaming month of the year at a low price ($19.99), received no marketing and has quite possibly the most generic name and cover art ever. Its the sort of game that will make a few quick bucks for its mere existence before its removed from the main video game display of a store and thrown into the bargain section, probably shrink-wrapped to another similar game or a pack of stylus. While the game is actually part of the Runabout series (a franchise that hasnt received an entry in over ten years), its clear that nothing  from the marketing to the development  aspired for anything more than a hey, cars crashing for cheap impulse buy by a ten-year-old at Target desperately trying to convince his mom to buy him a game.One of the biggest surprises of Crash City Mayhem is that is has a story. Well, sort of, at least. Youre an ex-spy turned courier who takes on missions for a mysterious organization that seems to show little thanks for your work. Theres double crossing and plot twists andnone of it makes any sense. But the fact that some shred of a story was even attempted instead of youre a car crashing through a city for some reason is a tiny bit admirable. After going through Drivers Ed, which is literally a tutorial that teaches you how to accelerate, brake and turn, the main game begins. The game is broken up into six different episodes, each with five missions. While each takes place in a different region, all are really just parts of one (admittedly large) city. Episodes consist of different missions, including ramming vehicles, stealing a spy car, hijacking a bus and more. The mission objectives arent all that creative and generally boil down to following an arrow on the top of the screen to the next waypoint as fast as possible. While theres thirty missions in all, only six are actually unique. Each episodes five missions are really the just the same exact mission five different times on a harder difficulty. So while the first missions objective may be to complete it in under five minutes, the second is simply to complete it under four. This means that youll be playing each stage five different times with little to show for it. To make matters worse, if you complete a mission in under, say, three minutes the first go, it wont count as completing the next two missions even though your time is lower than the objectives. While most episodes arent all that long, one tedious episode in particular takes at least ten minutes to complete. Tasked with shadowing a lady spy leaking info, you must follow her across town at a slow speed while not getting too close or too far away. At least three minutes of the mission has you following her walking on a sidewalk, meaning that youll be going no more than 3 or 4 MPH. Doing it once is acceptable, but doing it five times (even though it changes up the structure slightly a few times) is a pace killer for a game called Crash City Mayhem.Theres multiple cars that be unlocked throughout the game, ranging from classic muscle to a tank. Cars can be upgraded with new items unlocked by picking up hidden coins and tuned or changed in color. The tuning is nonsensical and counterintuitive, but some of the items are useful like shells for the tank. As this is a game about speed, however, the problem is that a lot of the vehicles prove to be useless. Try getting across a city in under five minutes in a tank, bus or on a Vespa. This also brings up another issue with the game, which is the lack of focus on destruction. While everything can be crushed earning you money, the money doesnt do anything. After enough damage is accrued, the car will blow-up and the mission will be over. There is a Free Ride mode on every episode that lets you rush around the city running into stuff without taking damage, but as theres no real objective or reward for doing these, theyre a bit pointless.Closing Comments:", "date": "July 7, 2013", "grade": 2.0}
