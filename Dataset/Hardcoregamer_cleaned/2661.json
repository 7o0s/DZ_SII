{"name": "Retrovirus", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=27809", "text": "It was sad to see the Retrovirus Kickstarter end unsuccessfully, because anyone who wants to resurrect Descents gameplay is fine by me. It even had a good demo to show off how nice the gameplay could be on a machine with just a bit more power than my old Pentium. Thankfully, a failed Kickstarter wasnt the end of the game, and Retrovirus has finally found its way into the world.Retrovirus is a six degrees of freedom shooter where you play as an antivirus, shooting down corruption wherever it rears its pulsating purple tentacles in the computer system. Gravity isnt all that important to an antivirus, so as you fly through the rooms the idea of up is what you make of it. You can take the visual cues from the environment or ignore them completely, depending on personal preference, but no matter how you play its going to take an excellent head for 3D space to make much progress.Once youve got the complete 3D spatial awareness bit down, Retrovirus turns into a fun and vibrant shooter with a very clever weapon system. Each weapon in the game leaves behind a bit of residue on impact, little bubbles that last a few seconds before fading. The ship also comes equipped with a scanner, which shoots a circular ring into the distance that, logically enough, scans whatever it passes over. Scan an enemy and you can see its outline behind an obstacle. Scan a door to open it. Scan the residue from your shots, however, and all sorts of interesting things can happen. Most guns in the game have a different secondary effect when hit by the scanner, and learning how to use them is going to make the larger battles a lot easier. The twin guns you start with have explosive residue, while the shotgun makes mini gravity wells. Shoot an enemy, scan it to activate the gravity and drag a cluster of enemies into a tight ball, and unload everything youve got to lovely destructive effect.As you destroy enemies, though, youre also accumulating data, and once enough has been accumulated it can be spent on power-ups. Think the machine gun would be better with more precision? Or maybe the scatter of its fire would work even better if you had two. You can pick one or another but not both, and theyre in different categories, too. Each powerup chosen has a secondary effect of increasing player speed, shot speed, or overall health, depending on its category, adding an extra wrinkle to the choice. Fortunately the decision is easily reversed, allowing you to play around with the powerup loadout.", "date": "January 30, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
