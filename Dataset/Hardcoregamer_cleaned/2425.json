{"name": "Eldritch", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=59362", "text": "The problem with information is that it wants to be known, no matter how hard people try to keep it secret, and the more dangerous it is the less likely it is to remain hidden. Twelve herbs and spices? Thats easily locked away, and even when people reason it out the world keeps on spinning. The secret rites to summon elder gods to overrun the world? Thats going to leak out no matter how many times the ancient tomes of lore are locked away or destroyed. Then some poor librarian gets locked away to guard the books, immortal no matter how many times she should have died at the hands of the creatures guarding her means of escape. Youd think people would be happy not knowing how to tug at the frayed edge of reality, but no.In Eldritch, youre a librarian whos forgotten why shes locked away in a labyrinthine library, and death is just a minor setback. Its a first-person stealth/action game that, somehow, manages to tease the charm out of PS1-style 3D with a blocky Minecraft look and low-poly everything else. Starting off in the library safehouse area you quickly find three glowing books, only one of which is open at the start, and reading one whisks the librarian away to a three-level dungeon crawling with Cthulhian beasties. Getting to the end involves surviving three randomly-generated dungeons of three floors each, at which point she gets an orb and the next book opens up. Put all three orbs on the pedestals and the final area becomes available, but theres a bit of a catch. Eldritch is a rogue-like, and thats not just due to the random levels. Death is semi-permanent, and while resurrection is easy its not free. Theres a treasure chest you can fill with money that remains untouched, and any opened books remain available, but all other progress is reset. The librarian goes back to having three health, no weapons or items, and worst of all no orbs. The only way to see the end is to do all areas in a single sitting. It doesnt actually take very long once you get the hang of it, but thats going to take several dozen deaths and a whole load of swearing before it happens.The first book of levels doesnt help prepare you for the journey, though. Like any good Level 1 enemies are relatively weak, but this means it teaches you to run around and slash everything to ribbons once youve found a knife. Fish-men, sorcerers, and other Old Ones all fall apart with a couple quick stabs, and if you dont feel like getting close guns and bullets are plentiful. The atmosphere and enemies are nicely spooky in a lo-fi PS1 kind of way, but theres no need for stealth. And then the second book of levels happens, requiring a complete re-learning of tactics. The real Eldritch is a game of careful movements and encounters. Enemies take enough hits that theyre much more likely to get a counter in if you flail away with the knife, and bullets arent so common that you can shoot everything that moves. Sneaking up behind enemies after leaning around the corner to scout the room, carefully tiptoeing to their back to get a good strike in, goes a long way towards guaranteeing survival. Not all enemies can be killed, though, and when they wake up after a few second they wont be happy. Worse, running away is a bad idea because of the Weeping Angel-like statues that, once theyve registered that theyve noticed you with a shudder and grating sound effect, will come right for you if you turn your back. The only way to escape is to keep an eye on them while carefully backing away around a corner, hoping you dont fall in a pit or get chewed on by an unhappy Old One. Fortunately the dungeons are made up of a random assortment of pre-built rooms, so you can get a sense of layout after a bit of experience, but carefully moving away while listening to the movements of things shuffling around the next room over, trying to nurse that last health point until you can find some food, and praying that you dont hit a trap can make for a very tense encounter.Oddly, Book 2 is by far the hardest section of the game. The enemies in Book 3 are tougher but the Lord Cthulhu monsters lie snoring so you can sneak by most of them, disarming traps for spare bullets to deal with the enemies you cant avoid. Book 1s level layouts are labyrinths, Book 2 is a bit more open, and Book 3 has holes in the floor everywhere making for easy travel. Beating all three books to open up the final area may seem just about impossible, but a bit of experience and finally figuring out that Book 1s lack of strategy isnt going to cut it any more turn survival into something thats merely very difficult. By the time youve opened up the last area, you should have the skills necessary to survive it without too much problem. Closing Comments:", "date": "October 22, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
