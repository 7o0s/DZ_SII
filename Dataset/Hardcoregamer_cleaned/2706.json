{"name": "Johnny Hotshot", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=17446", "text": "Set in the same universe as Johnny Kung-Fu from earlier this year, Johnny Hotshot takes things from an old-school LCD style to a newer-school shooting gallery game mixed in with some Track and Field-style button mashing. It all begins with Johnny enjoying some Western Fried Chicken, spilling his soda, and as this act is known to do, causing an interdimensional portal to appear and suck him into the old west. I wouldve preferred just having to replace some paper or at worst a game system due to some high-fructose corn syrup spillage, but poor Johnny just isnt that fortunate. He does at least find a sheriffs badge, and the citizens are smart enough to immediately side with the guy who just appeared out of thin air and give him the job. As the new sheriff of the old west, Johnny has to round up five banditos in three mini-games  two shooting galleries and one side-scrolling shooter/rodeo hybrid. Yes, theres now such a thing as that.The first of two shooting galleries gives you (usually) three targets on-screen at once and you have to shoot the bad guys. Now, due to the small screen on the original 3DS and lack of detail on the models to some some degree, it will take some trial and error to realize that you should only aim for characters with red outlines. Green outlines are for civilians, and shooting them negatively affects both your score and their lives. While youd expect a shooting gallery game on the system to use the touch screen, this doesnt  you can use either the analog stick or the d-pad (which works far better) and just pick the enemies you want to. In order to win the stage, you have to hit an enemy with a black-rimmed hat who appears for a split second. Hitting him requires a bit of timing and a lot of luck, so expect to retry the first stage of each boss a lot. These sections are a lot of fun, but the scarcity of the villain makes it feel like the developers are trying to pad out the experience a bit.The second shooting game is a behind the back affair with enemies popping up from side-to-side and also going towards you  with the black-rimmed guy trying to stay in the background. The same basic gameplay principles apply here, but hes far easier to spot in this mini-game and shows up earlier, so these takes less time and fewer replays to complete. The final part of the puzzle comes in multiple sections. First, you and the bandito shoot at each other using kiddy toys, while you avoid things like rocks, cacti, and BOMBS THROWN AT YOU. When youve depleted his life, you can hit A a bunch to catch up to him and wait for the meter to fill before hitting X and stopping in his tracks with your trusty lariat. The rope kind, not the Stan Hansen kind. Its a fun and satisfying mini-game, but will lead to at least one occurrence of another annoying thing  having to replay stages to do better in order to unlock enough stars to face the next enemy.Encouraging better performance by replaying an enjoyable game is fine, but making it mandatory to see the next stage, after having beaten every part of the preceeding stage, is annoying. It isnt just this game  Im against it when platformers force you to collect X amount of item Y to move on as well. It reeks of a way to make an experience that is naturally shorter artificially longer. It works against this game quite a bit since its nothing but bite-sized experiences anyway and it forces you to play for extended periods of time. That isnt always a bad thing, but when you do that, you start to see flaws in the presentation, like the elements of padding put in to make this a longer experience. It may take more time to complete in its current form, but it wouldve been a more satisfying, if shorter, experience by not having star requirements and just allowing you to move from enemy to enemy freely after beating the previous stage.Luckily, this issue doesnt hurt the overall package too much. The gameplay for all three mini-game types is fun, the control setup is excellent, and its bite-sized nature makes it work for quick play sessions, with longer ones being reserved for attempts to make serious progress in the story. The AV side of things works well enough. The 2D cutouts in the shooting galleries look good, while the 3D models in the rodeo mini-games look fine. Nothing sticks out poorly given the cartoonish style of the game, which is good, but JH wont blow you away visually. The audio is full of HELP ME sound effects and wacky old west music with some ragtime. The help me stuff is great since they make this seem like a modern-day light gun game, but the music didnt do a thing for me. Its not terrible, but if youve heard anything western-y ever in your life, you know what the music is here, and can just play the game muted and save some battery life.Closing Comments:", "date": "November 6, 2012", "grade": 3.5}
