Weve seen all sorts of games and developers jump on board who never would have been allowed to pre-Steam Greenlight. Lupiesoft is one of the latest, as theyve finally brought The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0  Prelude to the storefront. This is their first game on the marketplace and serves as a great testing ground for folks to determine whether they want to continue with the storyline or not once future episodes are released. So, how is The Reject Demon: Toko as it currently stands? Was the release delay worth the wait?It depends what kind of visual novel fan you are and what you expect from these games. Before we delve right in, the aspect of kinetic novels must be explained. For those unaware, a kinetic novel is a sort of visual novel which offers no choices for players to select from. That means there are no dialogue options or any sort of other user control over the storyline, aside from pressing enter or clicking to move to the next line of dialogue. Some perceive this to mean a title isnt really a game at all. Of course, most visual novel fans accept this subgenre as valid, regardless of their own personal tastes.The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0  Prelude is 100% a kinetic novel, meaning you sit down for 1 to 3 hours (depending on your reading speed) and then finish off the introductory storyline. With that said, Lupiesoft have suggested that there is potential for future episodes in the series to offer choices and multiple routes. If this occurs then, yes, youll get your chance to affect the tale and also get some replay value out of the game as well. This is not guaranteed, however, and its also possible that the entire episodic adventure will be kinetic in nature.Considering the story is the ultimate focus of the game, weve simply got to talk about it. The Reject Demon: Toko centers on a succubus from Hell named Toko. All demons must consume souls to survive in Hell, and in particular are meant to have their first human soul as a sort of passage into adulthood ritual. For whatever reason, Toko has never been able to fulfill this necessary ingredient of demonhood. After being given chance after chance, her superiors are done playing around. Tokos file is destroyed and she is sent to Earth  not to get one final shot but exiled there. A demon living among humans eventually becomes one themselves, losing all the hellish powers they once controlled. Banished, with no place to call home, Toko is hopeless.Luckily, she immediately (and quite literally) runs into Nadia. This overly-friendly, flirtatious woman takes Toko under her care and the two quickly bond. For some, this immediate and fateful meeting might seem a bit eye-rolling, as it feels like the story is on fast-forward with setup. Toko and Nadia arent allowed to live a happy, human life, though. It seems that Hell isnt quite done with Toko, even though shes no longer living there. Throughout Chapter 0, players are introduced to new characters, more drama and a surprising amount of action. The Reject Demon: Toko does seem to cut off quite suddenly, which is unfortunate as we currently dont know when the next episode will arrive.Visually speaking, The Reject Demon: Toko stands out well against its contemporaries. The character art style is anime-inspired, but shows off far more unique character styles than expected of the genre. Theres also a definite erotic flair to character designs which is surprising given the games all-ages status. With that said, these designs are unique when compared to the Sakura series of visual novels which feature cookie cutter bodies for women. Fans of Winged Clouds fanservice games might initially come to Lupiesoft title expecting the same, only to be pleasantly surprised by the actually compelling storyline it tells. The art could be considered a fanservice-filled bonus, but is not *the* reason to play.Speaking of which, those who are personally opposed to obvious pandering via CGs and character designs will have a bone to pick with this game in that most of the women are dressed in revealing garb. Some men, however, are also subject to the same treatment. The biggest takeaway here is that the outfits are purposeful, as no one would expect creatures from Hell to be chaste or in any way modest. CGs tread on quite risque territory, though, meaning that even the all-ages moniker is best interpreted as a lack of explicit sexual content rather than family friendly.Finally, this visual novels soundtrack deserves special mention. I was downright shocked at how good the tracks were when they started to play for the first time. There are multiple songs which amped me up and made the soundtrack DLC all that more appealing. As great as the music is, players will also notice that there is no voice acting in The Reject Demon: Toko. The developer has announced the possibility of voice actors being added later, but thats not a guarantee. In any case, the title works well enough without the inclusion of voice acting; poor acting could actually lead to a decrease in enjoyment of the final product.Closing Comments:The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0  Prelude is an excellent start for an episodic visual novel series. It sets up an intriguing, unique storyline and fills it with engaging characters. The biggest letdown is how the formation of Toko and Nadias relationship is basically breezed over. Without more attention to this aspect, its a bit harder to believe or care for whats going on there. Even so, you still get swept up in the story and its may twists and turns, and by the end its hard not to find yourself hungering desperately for The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 1.", "date": "May 11, 2015", "grade": 4.0}
