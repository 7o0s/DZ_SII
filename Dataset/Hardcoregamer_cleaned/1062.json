{"name": "Skullgirls 2nd Encore (PS Vita)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=202864", "text": "Its hard to believe that the original Skullgirls has already been on the scene for over four years. Time seems to pass by more quickly as one ages. There have been so many new editions to the fighting game genre since the release that its entirely possible that the mechanics have been surpassed by subsequent heavy hitters. Well, the Vita release of Lab Zero Games Skullgirls 2nd Encore has shown that this has not happened. This fighter was so well crafted that it would have been advisable for the new genre monsters to have taken a closer look before releasing.The drive behind this statement is the excellent training mode. Yes, it does start off with here is how to walk nonsense, but it quickly expands to include how to properly handle blocks, combos, punishing, and so forth. This mode is perfect for players who admire fighting games but get savaged every time they brave the waters. The lessons this mode has to impart can easily be transferred to other titles. 2nd Encore acts as the Super Turbo version of the original Skullgirls. This one comes packing all of the DLC characters and a fully voiced story mode. The latter is actually surprisingly well done. While most characters story pick up in the middle of a seemingly already established story, players new to the game wont have any real issues following along, as the exposition was written in such a way as to subtly explain whats happened before without talking down to players in the know. Its much like picking up a well written comic book in the middle of an arc.Graphically, this game nails it. The hand drawn animations are extremely welcome in an age where fighting games have embraced pre-rendered 3D. Everything here looks and feels smooth. Though the story line doesnt reflect it, the conceit around the graphical style is that of a old timey film studio shooting a cartoon. It just works, and works very, very well. All of this information is, in fact, old news. Skullgirls 2nd Encore has been out since last year for the Playstation 4. After many delays, it is finally seeing its Vita release. Were we just to cover the game in general, it would receive a top score. Its really, really good. However, there are some issues with the Vita version that should be addressed. The biggest sticking point is text. While the menus and story modes are easy to read, the aforementioned and lauded training mode becomes a nightmare of squinting. It is extremely difficult to learn what the game is trying to teach when the lessons are difficult to decipher. This goes for the button prompt instructions, too. With these, I came to rely on the string at the bottom of the screen that showed me what I entered. When I was able to figure out what the game wanted, I would use this to pocket the knowledge. Fortunately, the title is cross buy with the Playstation 4 version. The best recommendation for new players is to learn on the big screen before taking the show on the road.Another feature that the Vita version has is cross play support with the PS3 and PS4 editions. It can be argued that folks on the Vita are at a woeful disadvantage when taking on console players. Due to the smaller buttons and screen, dialing in combos and catching an opponents mistake isnt as easy. Its still workable, and being able to brag that the victor won playing on the portable has a certain allure. Alas, I was never able to achieve this particular bragging right in my play. Im still not great as veteran players.The Vita version does offer a concession to the button issue, at least. It is possible to program macros to areas of the touch screen, making it possible to make switching out team members on the fly or triggering a special a breeze. Im going to admit that I did not use this feature out of a misplaced feeling of pride, but it was tested against the A.I. It works well. Its surprisingly natural to move the thumb over and tap the edge of the screen.Graphically, the jump to the Vita did not harm this title. One thing the Vita is fantastic with is handling 2D, colorful sprites. It shows, here. The characters and style really pop on the old OLED screen, and it isnt too shabby on the the newer units, either. While I was at the laundromat, I had a couple of people stop and comment just how gorgeous the game looks in motion. This hasnt happened before, despite the fact my Vita is a stalwart companion when I know I have to wait. Closing Comments:Skullgirls 2nd Encore is an easy recommendation to anyone who has even a passing interest in the fighting genre. Each character plays different and are well balanced to hold their own. I found that Valentine was my girl, but with differing play styles, everyone can find a fighter that clicks. For players planning to primarily play on the Vita, it becomes a tad less simple to insist on a buy. A major draw for new players becomes almost unusable and certain concessions on the players part must be made due to the system itself. Still, people who want a strong, fast-paced 2D fighter on the go wont be able to do better than this entry.", "date": "Bohn on April 18, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
