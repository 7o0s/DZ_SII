{"name": "Crimsonland", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=90287", "text": "The name Crimsonland might be familiar to you. In fact, the game originally launched back in 2003. Its apparent that developer 10tons never forgot about their project and recently started about remaking it for PC and consoles. Having never played the original, my review is from the perspective of a gamer completely fresh to Crimsonland  and one who holds the title up to 2014 standards.Crimsonland is a twin-stick shooter with a top down perspective. Players can choose to control it via mouse and keyboard combo or simply plug in a gamepad. Both work well, although mouse control provides more precise aiming most of the time. There are a variety of stages and gameplay modes but they basically all boil down to the same general rule  shoot everything until you are the only one standing.Players should probably start out in quest mode since theyll gain access to new perks and weapons through completing it. This mode basically sets up stage after stage of bloody showdowns and hopes you can keep up. Each level is larger than the game window, meaning there is some scrolling when moving left, right, and whatnot. The backdrops themselves are nothing special and effectively uninspiring. However, youll quickly find the lack of astonishing artwork is quickly forgotten the minute enemies rush toward your character.As soon as Crimsonland starts to crank up its difficulty all you can do is focus on making it out of stages alive. Theres a need to keep an eye out for openings between enemy groupings to dodge between them, but also be alert for item drops. Running over these unleash a variety of special skills or will grant you a new weapon to use. Of course, its not just enough to run over these icons willy nilly. Youll want to use them when strategically necessary, which is a bit tough considering they disappear after being left untouched for long enough.Enemies vary in type from pure cannon fodder to seriously annoying. Early on, theres a stage in particular that is sure to drive a few players mad thanks to spider enemies that split into smaller spiders. For the most part, difficulty increases appropriately, but not on a few choice stages. At those times it jumps to basically end-game level difficulty which is really odd. In any case, as long as you can get through those then youre ready to take on the rest that Crimsonland has to offer.Beyond the quest mode theres a variety of survival modes to try out. These range from the typical survival to slightly more creative (sometimes incredibly tough) endeavors. Survival is fun because at the end of each level you get to access a new perk to help aid in the slaughter of helpless monsters. Whatever mode youre in also has room for local co-op for up to four players. Because of the amount of enemies present on screen, Crimsonland just wouldnt work as well with online multiplayer.There are a few odd bits about the game. For one, it has no resolution options beyond windowed and fullscreen mode. Similarly, it has a very huge GUI which seems smart for consoles but not so much on PC. All in all, theres not very much customization which is expected in most modern game releases. None of this destroys the core gameplay but it is a bit of a hindrance.Closing Comments:", "date": "June 19, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
