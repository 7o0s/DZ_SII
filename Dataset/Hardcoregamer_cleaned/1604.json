{"name": "Game of Thrones: Episode Three  The Sword in the Darkness", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=142154", "text": "After the first two episodes in Telltales episodic series based on the popular television show proved resoundingly terrible, there wasnt much reason to expect anything more (or less) from this latest episode; you might even categorize our response to the news of an impending episode as dread. But God help us, whether its a classic case of Stockholm Syndrome or things have actually improved in this series, we think we might have actually enjoyed The Sword in the Darkness, at least a little bit. No, the choices still dont matter, and yes, the game still looks like garbage, but the pacing in this episode has been improved into something that actually sort of resembles the television show if you squint a little, and thats made all the difference. Of course, if youre reading this far, like us, you either already made the mistake of buying the season pass and are thus locked in, so the quality of this episode doesnt really matter at a certain point, or you just have a morbid curiosity. Either way, lets get into it.Like the last episode, youll open on an action scene with Asher, the blond, roguish Forrester son exiled from Westeros tasked with raising an army, before jumping back and forth between the remaining cast: Rodrik, as he desperately tries to maintain control of Ironrath amidst a Whitehill invasion; Mira, as she maneuvers through the dangerous political machinations of Kings Landing; and Gared, as he tries to balance the warring responsibilities of finding the potentially mythical North Grove to save the Forresters and his newly sworn duty to the Nights Watch. The Sword in the Darkness cuts between its different plot lines much more often than either of the previous two episodes, and its a much more enjoyable and interesting episode as a result. Before one thread is pulled so long it threatens to unravel completely, the episode switches smartly to another family member and back again. Its still not as dynamic as the show it mimics, of course, but its a step in the right direction, and that simple change makes the entire episode much easier to sit through.It helps that  predictably  each plot line is getting more urgent as the episodes march on. You feel pretty helpless as Rodrik in the face of the Whitehills, who have gotten more aggressive than ever with the addition of Gryff Whitehill, a hook-nosed, petulant ruffian with something to prove to everyone. Rodriks scenes are effective at hammering how helpless he is against Gryff and his men due both to his injuries and to the power they hold over him, and as the player, youre forced to either make Rodrik swallow his pride for his family in humiliating ways or give in at great risk to everyone involved. The same conflict extends to Gareds scenes as you decide whether to put aside or ignite old rivalries, put your family or your new brothers first, and whether or not to take revenge in a super satisfying way (that we cannot believe only 20% of fellow players chose to give in to). Gareds scenes have a lot more intrigue than before with the hunt for the North Grove beginning, and it feels a little like a somehow even clumsier The Da Vinci Code, as for instance Gared suddenly realizes a necklace hes had for months is actually a locket crucial to solving the mystery. Still, the clumsy intrigue here is better than the boredom of previous episodes. Mira and Ashers scenes still feel a little dry, even as big events happen around them: on one hand, its refreshing how willing Telltale is to let the showstopper moments happen completely in the background, but on the other, they still feel forced in and the timing of character appearances often makes you question whether Telltale has even watched the scene theyre writing for.Luckily, since each scene is much shorter than before, theyre much more focused and less keen to waste your time. In previous episodes, Telltale would be content to drop you in as Ethan, for instance, exploring Ironrath courtyard with no pressing objective, leaving you free to talk to everyone and observe everything with no real payoff; or perhaps Mira, locked in a room with lots of trunks and desks and windows and no point at all. Those sequences were boring, dreadfully so, and lacked any kind of punch or justification  no real backstory or character depth to explore, just pointless interactions with a bucket, or a barrel, or a wall. That still exists in The Sword in the Darkness, but mercifully, it seems Telltale is making the interactions that are there more meaningful and removing several others.Now, for instance, Gared will reminisce about his days as a squire in Ironrath to show how much hes grown as a character, or hell comment on the threat of Mance Rayder and his Wildling army to offer a little useful exposition to remind players where we are in relation to the shows timeline. But youll still ask Gared to comment on an ice wall and hell say, Thats made of solid ice, or youll ask him observe an unlit torch he was tasked with lighting and hell say, I need to light that one, and youll wonder why Telltale even bothered to record those lines. It cost money and time to record those pointless lines, and it costs you money and time to listen to them. So the problem isnt quite gone yet entirely, but like with pacing, little by little, Telltale is making progress.But Telltale isnt making progress on every front. Conversations feel muddled by the burden of choice. Nothing ever flows in a natural way, and instead characters will hop back and forth between unrelated topics and tones. We selected a conversation option for Gared labelled, Welcome to Castle Black, only for him to say, Welcome to the Wall, brother, to which the other character responded, Looking forward to it, boy. It makes no sense, and mismatches like that happen all the time. Even the presentation on these conversations doesnt hold up. The voice work is often shoddy, with different lines in the same conversation from the same character often varying greatly in quality and sounding like they came from different recording sessions. You can clearly see the characters moving between animation routines to account for where the conversation is going. Its really tough to stay immersed in or care about whats happen onscreen when it looks and sounds this rough.Really, it cannot be stressed enough just how bad this game looks. Seriously, with each month that passes between episodes, we consistently forget just how awful these episodes look and each time its like seeing them with fresh eyes. They look terrible. Terrible. The textures are muddy. The animations are stilted and jittery. The lip syncing is miserable. The characters look fake and their expressions are exaggerated in a really distracting way. Theres sharp aliasing that cuts across the edges of a lot of objects to pull your gaze to them. Trees in particular (there are a lot of them) are a lowlight for the game, with flat textures jutting out in obvious ways that draw attention. The oil painting filter makes everything look even worse at a distance than it does up close  the exact opposite problem of most video games  and it makes the background deform around characters as they walk; its a visual style designed to make screenshots look like art, but it just ends up making the game look horrible in motion. To top it all off, the games big punchline is that it cant even keep a solid frame rate: the entire game will freeze for a good three or four seconds on occasions not nearly rare enough, and aggravating little hitches happen constantly.Closing Comments:Its still impossible to recommend this series to anyone but Telltale diehards; fans of the HBO show will find it supremely unsatisfying and dreadfully boring, and its too steeped in lore for anyone else to jump in. The Sword in the Darkness does nothing to change that, but it does push the quality bar just a hair higher, elevating itself all the way into I guess that wasnt terrible territory. With better pacing, more interesting plot lines and more focused interactions, The Sword in the Darkness is easily the best episode of Telltales Game of Thrones yet; its not good by any means yet, but its getting dangerously close.", "date": "April 1, 2015", "grade": 2.5}
