{"name": "The Walking Dead: Michonne  Episode 2: Give No Shelter", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=200109", "text": "When it came to the first episode of The Walking Dead: Michonne, Telltales little side adventure to tide us over until the third season of The Walking Dead, my most prominent complaint was that the episode lasted a mere forty minutes. Well, Im happy to report that the issue of length has been improved with the second episode! Give No Shelter lasts a whole sixty-five minutes before it ends! Progress!Yeah, I still say making this spin-off episodic was a huge mistake. The bite-sized lengths just dont have the same impact as a larger single installment that makes for something meatier. I am happy to say, however, that The Walking Dead: Michonne is still good and the story is making some decent progress with our titular lead, even with a misstep or two.When we last left Michonne, she and her recent companions were being held captive by tyrants du jour Norma and Randall in their makeshift community, now needing a way to escape. And throughout all of this, Michonne has been haunted by visions of her missing children from the beginning of the outbreak. Eventually, she escapes with her current accomplices and they all head to the house of one of their families, who just so happen to have two adorable young boys reminiscent of Michonnes own pair of missing girls, which is totally not a contrived way to trigger some traumatic horror for our lead at all. Yes, missteps in storytelling tend to happen, like how all of the family members engage in discussions about needing the strength to move forward and being there for each other all while drinking out of coffee cups that say I Heart Not Dying Soon, but there are some incredible moments indeed. A particular highlight is a moment where you have to craft one of Michonnes signature tools, and while the lead-up is a tad groan-worthy as mentioned, the interactive flashback triggered by the kids where you get some backstory and try to piece things together is a welcome addition, as is an impromptu surgery sequence. And it goes without saying that the action sequences are still incredible, with Michonne providing some incredible fight scenes.That said, it felt like this episode of The Walking Dead: Michonne had more action than the previous one, which meant more ass-kicking and suspense, but also meant more quick-time events in place of dialogue and more traditional adventure game elements. Suffice it to say, if you have a problem with QTEs, this still isnt the game for you, though I didnt have much of a beef with them. That said, Telltale, please stop using the bit where you bash the Q key until a meter is filled and then you suddenly have to press E. That is always way too easy to screw up, and is never welcome.What is welcome, though, is Samira Wiley as Michonne, who keeps doing a great job getting across the pain the character is feeling and the ghosts that haunt her, all while being able to still remain quite badass. In fact, even if their characters arent the most inspired, the whole cast does quite the good job as well. The graphics are also still pleasing to the eyes, though the lack of any new scenery (save for a typical household) hurts things slightly, again a fault of the choice to go with shorter episodes.Closing Comments:Give No Shelter is another good episode of The Walking Dead: Michonne that showcases some slight improvements and sets the stage for a potentially great showdown, but still suffers from a few cliches and an all-too-short length that leaves you demanding more. Will the third episode provide a stronger conclusion that makes the game as a whole worth it all? Well find out, but for now, its still suggested that you wait for this season to wrap up.", "date": "March 30, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
