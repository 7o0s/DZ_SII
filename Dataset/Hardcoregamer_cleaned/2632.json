{"name": "Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=32231", "text": "Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan is the pinnacle of its series. While it might not break new ground with wholly original mechanics, it without a doubt refines the first-person dungeon delving for which the franchise is known; it uses all the same concepts as previous seen and experienced, but just simply does them better. Thus, if gamers are looking for a time-sink with engrossing combat and a wonderful world to explore, then Etrian Odyssey IV is just what the doctor ordered.Legends of the Titan is the kind of game that doesnt concern itself with providing players an adventure filled with unnecessarily obnoxious fluff. This philosophy is apparent within the first twenty minutes of the game, when players will find themselves already in the clutches of the games first dungeon without having plodded through text-block after text-block of tutorials and background story. Then, forty minutes in, players will already have their first airship. Consequently, developer Atlus sets the stage for an adventure that is all about engrossing the player in as much actual gameplay as possible. Though, this doesnt mean Etrian Odyssey is without a plot to follow because it would seem that special emphasis has been placed on the games story this time around, at least more so than in some of the previous games.For those wondering, Legends of the Titan is a sequel to the third title in the Etrian series, but that shouldnt deter newbies from diving right in. The truth is, because Etrian Odyssey has never been a property most known for its elaborate narration, jumping into this fourth installment is easy, even without having any knowledge of the events of the previous games. Sure, players might miss certain nods to characters of the past, but it never once feels like they needed to play the previous titles to enjoy what IV has to offer in the way of story. (Which isnt a whole lot to be honest.) As a result, we might call Etrian Odyssey IVs plot accessible, which is something that cant necessarily be said about its gameplay.Etrian Odyssey is mostly looked upon as the kind of game that will make a man out of you. Its not for the feint of heart because its tough as nails, and punishingly cut-throat. That concept is very much so front and center in this fourth iteration, however, the game does include a casual option for newcomers who are looking to simply enjoy the game for what it is, and not break their 3DS in a fit of rage.Regardless of the difficulty chosen at the beginning of the game, the core gameplay is the always same. Players will start off by recruiting a band of heroes; they will have the option to create up to 30-ish characters, which includes deciding the individuals name, gender and class. Once theyve enlisted the help desired, they can then traverse the games vast world and dungeon-crawl to their hearts content. In said dungeons, players explore large labyrinths in first-person mode. Upon first entry into these mazes, players are not given a map, but rather must transcribe their own as they explore the confines. This is done via the touchscreen, where players can map out pathways, monster locations, special items and hidden doors. If a mistake is made, its easily erased, as the map creation screen is sort of just like a paint tool. Because of this, the mechanic is intuitive and heinously habit-forming.But when players arent charting out their dungeon investigations, they are busy engaging in ruthless combat. The battling is something akin to Dragon Quest, in that its carried out through a first-person perspective and commands are given that are unique to each character and class. Theres a plethora of strategy involved, such as making choices about which characters will be front-line fighters, and which will reside in the rear line; which classes to take into what dungeon, which skills to equip, and of course what are the enemys weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Its all presented so elegantly that, despite the tactical depth, it never feels overwhelming. It instead strikes a delicate balance of offering easy-to-understand combat, without being too shallow or too much.The most exciting part of Etrian Odyssey IV is the level of customization available for players. Characters can be equipped with all sorts of goodies, and trust us when we say there are plenty of goodies to be found. Thats part of the dungeon crawling appeal in Legends of the Titan  looting and killing baddies is something dished out in spades. So for those who love a good romp through dank labyrinths in order to vanquish giant foes and collect all sorts of treasure, will be at home with the games emphasis on these components.Aside from the wonderful gameplay, however, Etrian Odyssey sports a brand new, super clean interface that further speaks to the games overall level of care and polish. Menus and text are of the perfect resolution  something that not all 3DS games can claim  and are vibrant to the point that theyre an absolute treat to look at. Actually, the entire game has a lush window dressing, making use of a variety of colors, even in the darkest of dungeons.Where Etrian has always excelled, and continues to do so, is in the art department. Yet again, players are treated to some genuinely delightful character designs that are both charming and imaginative, evoking a sense of uniqueness amid the anime-inspired art scene; a feat not easily accomplished in the JRPG market, seeing as its saturated by big eyed, big-breasted heroines and battle-worn bruisers. While it maintains the art style of all the previous games, it also seems to use a bit more color and variety in the character designs especially; monsters look wonderfully gruesome as well.These aesthetics are brought to life by the games enhanced graphics. While every other Etrian release has been for the DS, Odyssey IVs jump to superior technology with the 3DS has done wonders for its presentation, as environments look lively and less static. Of course, more animations would be great on the combat screen, but beggars cant be choosers. The graphics are made all the better by some of the best 3D work in a 3DS title yet. Providing an excellent sense of depth, Legends of the Titan was the first 3DS game I played till completion with the 3D slider turned all the way up.Etrian Odyssey IVs soundtrack is a thing of beauty too, giving players sweeping symphonies, stirring hymns and lamenting ballads, all of which hammer home the point that Legends, more than any of the games in its series, does a damn near perfect job at creating a captivating atmosphere and world that seems worthy of gamers every ounce of effort put into exploring it.Of course, with all this talk of the great stuff Etrian Odyssey IV does, some might mistakenly assume its without fault. While Legends of the Titan is a fantastic game through and through, its not flawless. More love should been given to animating the combat, since the bulk of the game will be spent in it. Moreover, it has some issues with difficulty spikes as well as occasionally feeling like a war of attrition thanks to the grind-y taste that will be left in the mouths of some gamers. Of course, by this point, if players dont know theyre in for a very combat-oriented, dungeon-exploring experience, then they obviously havent read the previous thousand words of this review, or done any research whatsoever.Closing Comments:", "date": "March 4, 2013", "grade": 4.5}
