{"name": "Solitairica", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=227721", "text": "A great adversary that threatens the land has taken root in a distant castle. Its a malevolence so terrible that there is no choice. It must be defeated or the world will forever be altered for the worse. Gathering an army proved fruitless, as the vast caravan required to supply the would be saviors became stuck in the mire of one of the surrounding swamps. Swarms of mages and assassins attempted to work in tandem, only to be overwhelmed by adorably ugly little slugs making cute chirping sounds. Finally, the plan came down to one last choice: a lone warrior with a deck of cards. Evil is about to be paper cut to the quick.Most of the proceeding paragraph embellishes the backstory of Righteous Hammer Games Solitairica a bit, primarily because this author found himself overly amused with the overwrought tagline that he created based on the time with the game. Thats the thing about this casual card game/rogue-lite hybrid of a title. It is so simple, relaxing, and addictive that it allows for an almost zenlike state, even while decimating oncoming foes.It is true that there is an distant castle that must be reached, with a denizen that must be destroyed. To do so, players must play a variation of Tripeaks Solitaire. Instead of being set up in pyramids, the cards are in stacks. The player is given a base deck and draws one card. From there, they must match a run of numerically sequential cards, with Ace being higher than King but lower than Two to close the loop. Every time a run cannot be continued, the player draws another card from their deck. At this point, the enemy gets a chance to attack or use a skill. The conceit is that the players deck represents their weapon, with the cards on the board acting as the enemys health bar. Its actually a quite clever abstraction that equates card runs as well aimed sword slashes and spells. As Solitaire can easily be lost based on one wrong move, there are further skills that can be used. These line the left side of the screen, and allows for players to remove an errant card, heal, add armor, take a peek at covered cards, and more. These skills are powered using elements that are earned from matching up the cards. Items and additional skills can also be purchased between battles to further buff the player. As this is a rogue-lite, death is an inevitability. Some of the enemies are just overpowered for a player just starting out. When the player dies, they are awarded stones that can be used to purchase additional deck classes, or power up an existing one to make the next attempt at the castle a bit more palatable. The new decks also introduce some new skills into the mix that can offer new ways to finish an enemy.This might seem a bit twee and precious, but in practice, the game design really works. Admittedly, this is a case where an existing and well worn game had RPG mechanics bolted onto it, but Righteous Hammer Games really put some thought into it. The use of the spells and skills are designed to require some base strategic thinking to be used effectively while the amount available allow a player to tailor their loadout to their strengths. The randomness of the items that appear in the shop forces some hard choices. Would it be better to get this health boost now, or hold out in hopes that some stronger armor will be available after the next battle? While the choices to make dont exactly require a Europa Universalis level of contemplation, it keeps a simple game from getting dull.It should be obvious through the description of this games mechanics that I am enamored with Solitairica. It serves as a fantastic palette cleanser and offers an entertaining time through its twist on a basic design. There is one flaw that tends to grate, though. After seeing the same enemy effects and hearing the sound effects over and over, it would be nice if their moves could be sped up. Basically, an option that allows the player to acknowledge that they know what is going to happen. Just dole out the lumps and lets get back to it. As it stands, the pacing of the battles can drag a bit, especially when there is only a handful of cards left on the board and the player has to keep drawing to get a needed number to finish it up. Closing Comments:There is a genre of games that I have dubbed a Cat Game. That is, a title that can be played on a laptop one handed while sitting in a recliner and petting a cat with the other (dogs are an acceptable substitute). Its been awhile since a really good one has come along, but Solitairica fits the bill quite handily. With the right mindset, the game design is perfect for a brain cleanse or to serve as a half distraction while contemplating a more complex problem. The one thing holding it back is the pacing. Were an option added to resolve this, it would be a title to reign supreme among the cat game genre.", "date": "Bohn on September 28, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
