{"name": "Tower of Guns", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=76711", "text": "Somewhere out there is a giant tower packed with hundreds of ways to die. Gun emplacements spew dense walls of deadly projectiles, death-bots of various shapes and sizes float through the air and either charge at you in kamikaze attacks of throw endless streams of bullets your way, and even the halls and giant rooms seem downright unfriendly. (Except for the hugbots, of course, who only want to shower you with love and adoration.) The tower is a strange and unpredictable place, making it the perfect arena to go sightseeing with your favorite gun.Tower of Guns is a semi-randomized high speed FPS in the classic Quake style, mixed with a healthy dose of roguelike design. Youve got one life to get from the bottom to the top of the tower, and each run is a new experience even when you gain some familiarity with the rooms. At games start you pick a gun and a single perk, then scavenge what you can along the way in an attempt to be powerful enough to survive the upper floors. One of the biggest problems, though, is that the order of the rooms, the enemy layout, and the powerups you find along the way are all randomized. In addition to making Tower of Guns fantastically replayable, the randomization does its usual job of making every room and encounter a reaction waiting to happen. Knowing that theres a secret behind a false wall doesnt mean that the secret will be worth chasing. It might be three coins, it might be a power-up shop selling something you cant afford yet, or it might be a giant pile of gun-enhancing blue cards. From an enemy perspective, you might get a mix of buzzsaw-shooting turrets along the walls and rapidly-darting gunbots floating through the air, or it could just as well be a handful of spiked ball-shooting big-mouthed turrets and a few bombots to chase you around and explode in your face. A room that in one run has a few enemies hanging out might have the walls packed with guns throwing a giant barrage of shells your way the next.The result is an FPS thats about reflexes and adaptation. You go in with a gun and perk of your choosing, with more options becoming available at the games start as various goals are met. For guns youve got your basic zappy-pistol and another that shoots ricocheting saw blades, and quickly add a shotgun, rapid-fire pulse rifle, short range spiked-ball launcher, and a several others. Perks start off with the incredibly-helpful triple jump, expand to include immunity to various types of damage (fall, environmental, self-inflicted), and some other odds and ends. The only real complaint I can give the game is how hard it is to pass up the triple jump, because it makes exploring the arenas and finding much-needed power-ups not so much easier as actually possible to do. Still, mixing and matching guns and perks is a nice start for keeping every game feeling new, but the real variety in abilities comes in what you can scavenge along the way.Most enemies drop a goodie or two, usually in the form of health, gun experience, or coins. The guns start off at level one and can get far deadlier as they level up to 5 (or 6 with the right perk), but power is more than just damage. You can also find speed, extra jumping power (quintuple jump? Sure, if youre lucky), armor, damage, luck, gun mods, and even very rarely new weapons that arent available in the gun selection screen. The skills you pick up along the way determine the best play style, and its important to be able to adapt on the fly. A few speed boosts and the precision gun mod turn the shotguns tactics from crowd control into fast twitch-sniping, while the fire mod means the pulse rifle can pepper the walls with imprecise firepower that leaves behind a burning red dome of pain for anything it touches. Tower of Guns is already a fantastically solid bit of FPS shooting before lucking into a crazy-powerful gun, but with the right perks and mods you can feel like a gun-god even while the later levels are still fully capable of kicking your teeth in.
