Destiny 2 was released a month later on PC and ended up being the definitive version. Injustice 2 was released way back in May and ended up being fantastic. NetherRealm Studios continues to innovate fighting games as other fighting franchises have now incorporated story modes as they all continue to play catch-up with Mortal Kombat and the Injustice series. Players unfamiliar with the DC Comics fighting game can read our review of the console version in the link above for all the details. PC players may be more attracted to this game than normal fighting games due to its depth and structure, which raises the bar for fighting games.PC gamers are generally fans of collecting loot and upgrading armor in different types of games. Injustice 2 is the first fighting game to do this as fights manage to flow differently. Theres no fatalities or even kill shots as defeating an enemy in a fight simply drops them to their knees. Progressing through the story mode is only half the game as the story tells a solid narrative that even surpasses the recent Justice League film. The story mode forces players to play as different characters as doing so progresses the story. Injustice 2 will prompt players to choose a specific player for some fights as the idea is to find characters that fit you while telling a good story. The difference in Injustice 2 involves collecting different gear to upgrade your fighters. It adds a RPG aspect to the game as players will find themselves grinding for gear.While some gear is granted to the player when reaching certain levels with their profile or a specific character, the rest is obtained via loot boxes. With the current backlash involving loot boxes, this might not please some players who hadnt played the franchise in the past. There are five different tiers of loot boxes, but most of the time players will get a useful piece of loot. The grinding on this can be an issue with how its structured. Players may land loot for characters they dont use or high level loot that may never be achieved. The grinding process isnt as much as an issue as say Battlefront II, but its a work nonetheless. There are many different modes to collect points to get the loot boxes or even get other gear, but you cant work towards a specific piece of equipment in a store. What is given to you is completely random and selling the equipment doesnt grant that many points. Its honestly worth it just to hold on to the gear you get. The best way to grind for points and gear and raise the level of your characters is through the Multi-verse. An ever-changing environment that includes fights with different stipulations as it crosses multiple DC Universes will always keep things fresh. The game also features Guilds, which is basically a clan. There are bonuses provided for Guild Goals that are met. There is also a Legendary Multiverse for once players reach a high level to get even better gear. NetherRealm Studios wants you to get great at this game with the amount of grinding thats needed but from multiple outlets to keep you busy.Playing online on the PC version of Injustice 2 probably wont be the same experience as consoles with a much lower player count thus far. There are rooms and quick rank and unranked matches, one of which involves a best-of series. Hopping online also shows your opponents frame rate for their setup, which is the most important part of Injustice 2 on PC. Due to the lack of people, match-ups are an issue. There are too many times where being a low level involved battling with a high level opponent. The good aspect about this is that bonuses are granted for being competitive, but ultimately feels like a waste until you get your characters to a certain level. Injustice 2 is no slouch visually and this remains true on PC. With fighting games, however, a fast and consistent frame rate are the most important aspects. The minimum video card recommended for this game is either a GTX 1060 6GB or a AMD RX 570. This will most likely net you 60 FPS at 1080p. Anything less than that will not offer a good experience with the game. I ran a GTX 1070 8GB and was able to run all settings on the highest at 1440p and maintain 60 FPS. Jumping to 4K kept the game close to 50 FPS, but the game wasnt the same.Even on low settings, the game is a beautiful as facial textures look extremely realistic and the colors on everything truly pop out. Harley Quinns face and her gestures come off human. The visuals are a vibrant masterpiece that properly captures the DC Comics Universe, but it will take a substantial setup for the best experience. The requirements may be listed for lower specs, but its simply for the fact that a GTX 1050 will run the game. At least 8GB of RAM and an AMD Ryzen 5 1400 would be the other hardware needed to accomplish 60 FPS. Luckily, there is an in-game benchmark test thats fairly quick to make adjustments to then grade your performance based on the graphics options afterwards. Closing Comments:NetherRealm Studios has continued to evolve fighting games. Injustice 2 comes off as more of a RPG with the battle interface existing as a non-complicated fighting game. Its a great way to learn about characters in the DC Universe as well. There are a slew of characters here, but with the game being out for a while, charging $80 for the Ultimate Edition with the DLC is a reach. Add this to the lack of players online and you may be aiming for more of a single player experience. The PC version will require a decent setup as a consistent 60 FPS is the most important aspect. The PC version also doesnt lack or add to the console release from May, but it did take an extra six months to pump out the visuals. The looting structure might lure PC gamers who normally arent into the likes of Street Fighter or Tekken, but then again the loot box design could turn them off. Either way, the PC version of Injustice 2 is just as great as the console version, but currently comes cheaper on the consoles.", "date": "November 27, 2017", "grade": 4.0}
