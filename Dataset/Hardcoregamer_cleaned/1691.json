{"name": "Criminal Girls: Invite Only", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=132480", "text": "Many have criticized Sonys support of their handheld market over the years, but if theres one thing their platforms have always been full of its JRPGs. With such a massive amount available, it wasnt surprising that many stayed in Japan. One of which was an odd title by the name of Criminal Girls on PSP. This title didnt raise much attention in the Western gaming sphere back in 201o and was allowed to just pass on by. In 2013 the release of Criminal Girls: Invite Only did gain some press  and news of a release in North America. At this point, many individuals reacted negatively, but just as many were excited to finally get a taste of the series. Now that its finally available, everyone will be able to decide for themselves whether this JRPG is closer to awesome or tasteless.Criminal Girls takes players to Hell where the protagonist has just received a new job. His goal? Simply to save a collection of sinful souls from an eternity of suffering by getting them through the Redemption Program.These criminals will be able to leave Hell as reformed citizens if they can an survive all four challenges. Of course, each delinquent wants little to do with you, so along with trying to make it through the various underworld dungeons, youre also always at odds with them along the way. The most obvious implementation of this is in the unique battle system in which players cannot choose what moves are performed.Yes, you read that correctly. This is a JRPG where each team member has a mind of her own. Instead of selecting attacks on your turn via a list, you simply have to sit back and let each character offer up their own suggested move. Then youre free to select between the suggestion you like most and let them attack that turn. It might sound terrible, but in actuality the system isnt horrible. This is because each turn you are given at minimum four options, one from each girl currently in play, and can even switch another girl into the active team if needed. Along those lines each character is making semi-intelligent choices. If everyone is low on health, theyll offer up a healing spell (but this spell will basically never come up in circumstances where everyone is just fine). After gaining a new character its even possible to sway combatants toward offensive, defensive and other strategies.Its worth noting that the buildup of battles is strangely slow. Each girl is so opposed to being teamed up with you at the very beginning that they wont even attack. First you must gain enough points to Motivate any of them to actually attack. Thankfully, the basic attacks and skills are cheap so it doesnt take long to give each gal a few moves to work with. Getting enough points to unlock later types of moves, however, requires a ton of grinding. Again, you have no real influence over which shell choose in the heat of battle, but increasing their pool of possible attacks is a smart move. Players will find it especially useful once they recognize that elemental attacks can prove incredibly powerful against various enemy types.Motivation deserves a bit more discussion as it is this aspect of the game which drew the most contention pre-release. As the game tells it, you must whip, electrocute and drip liquids on each of the delinquents so theyll learn a new battle ability. This aspect definitely seems to pull from sadomasochistic fetishes, which are totally alright to have, although it seems a bit out of place here  and the only thing set to really set Criminal Girls apart from other games. Each Motivation sequence shows a CG of your chosen girl in a fanservice-y way, although even if you dig that itll be hard to really concentrate given the minigame playing over it. Basically, you must click and drag on the Vitas touch screen and rear touch pad in response to on-screen indicators. It starts easily enough but becomes challenging as you go. Honestly, having rarely used the rear touch pad, its a bit frustrating to accurately execute some of these moves.Outside of battles and Motivation minigames Criminal Girls seems tremendously samey. Dungeon crawling is expected in this genre but usually there is some way to mix it up. Here theres not really much to get excited about. Each area is shown from a top down perspective and the map is filled with fog until each section is explored. Along the way youll run through copious random battles and a few simplistic puzzles here and there. Usually story tidbits are included with puzzles although they feel pretty minimal in nature, giving you just a small taste of each characters personality. Considering the high stakes, no one seems all that stressed out. Along with enemy encounters theres also treasure to discover and some optional missions.Theres just so much grinding required to make it through the game without feeling like each battle is a tremendous struggle. Grinding is made terribly unfun (as if its ever that great) by making each turn take as long as possible. During fights youll have to sit through everyone taking their turn, EX moves firing off, and notification of all status and health changes. For example, if a huge blast hurts every team mate youve got to wait for each girls name and damage to be listed off because it cant all be shown at once apparently. If you could speed up battle animations or turn them off this would be fine but you cant! It all makes the already dull experience of grinding one that really grates on nerves. Then there are smaller issues such as super limited item capacity (max of 15 duplicates) which are unfortunate design decisions.Closing Comments:Criminal Girls feels like an incredibly average JRPG that just so happens to have a slightly strange battle system and fetishistic minigames at the helm. These facets, especially the latter, seem to have been included to make it stand out against competition. It does stand out initially, but actually dealing with these systems proves to be a lot more monotonous than one would hope. Although far from broken, not being able to specify which ability you want a character to use feels limiting  especially when you want to use a specific move. As for Motivating the cast, its up to each player whether they find it sexist or sexy, but one things for certain: it isnt any fun. Being forced to wade through a dull minigame every time you want a new skill slows down the pace. Then theres the battles themselves which drag on as if players really care about the second by second excitement of grinding. This is not to say that Criminal Girls: Invite Only is inherently broken; it certainly functions and offers over twenty hours of gameplay, but theres better JRPGs available.", "date": "February 2, 2015", "grade": 2.5}
