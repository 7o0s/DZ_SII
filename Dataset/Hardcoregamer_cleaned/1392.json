{"name": "Laserlife", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=169544", "text": "Gaijin Games originally made a name for themselves when BIT.TRIP BEAT blasted onto the scene. This heavily Pong-themed rhythm game set the precedent for what was to come by this developer in the next few years. Since the original BIT.TRIPs release, each new title retained an adoration for music and simplistic, totally compelling gameplay. With the launch of Bit.Trip Presents Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien, that chapter of the Gaijin Games story came to a close. They didnt stop creating, however. Instead, the team created a few new arcade-style experiences, published the work of other developers and rebranded themselves as Choice Provisions. The latest game from Choice Provisions is none other than Laserlife for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Initially announced in 2010, Laserlife has somehow managed to fly completely under the radar by all but the most diehard of Gaijin Games/Choice Provisions fans. After being shelved and revived, its finally out on consoles and PC  though many still dont even know what the heck it is. In many ways, Laserlife could be considered an on-rails rhythm game. Of course, leaving the description at that would completely undersell the experience one receives when actually playing through. Gameplay is fairly simplistic in that players are only required to move the two analog sticks on their controller and press shoulder buttons in time with musical beats. Yes, this does necessitate that you use a controller on PC, by the way (unless you happen to own an Intel RealSense Camera and want to engage in bodily motion-based play).There are three main phases to gameplay and each tweaks the formula in a slight way. First, players are treated to a lovely exploration of space where they must collect orbs floating toward the screen. Once the orbs reach a specific distance, players point the analog stick(s) toward it, moving one or both lasers onscreen. This ray is whats used to help capture orbs, though players must ensure they actually hit the triggers at the right time to grab it. Missing a couple isnt a huge deal, but if you fail to collect enough then the stage wont allow you to progress to the next section. The second section is basically a memory sequence where trippy visuals take hold and showcase an abstract version of someones memory (memories of visiting a park, having a pet dog, etc). In the third stage, your goal is simply to guide your lasers to safety as blockades appear on screen. The third stage seems the most obscure in attempting to relate to the hazily defined story of Laserlife.So, whats the storyline all about? Were first treated to an image of a skeleton in an astronaut uniform floating in space and given little other context. With this in mind, though, it makes total sense that we are working through the memories of this being. As such, theres little need for the game to be particularly realistic. Our journeys through the imagined galaxy and memories of someones life are incredibly gorgeous and set the tone for a very special experience. Visually, this game stands as one of the best on modern consoles simply for its bravery in being completely out there. Graphics are bold, futuristic, drug-like, and altogether psychedelically gorgeous. Space has never been depicted like this in a video game before, and it likely never will again.All of this is combined with a stellar electronic house music soundtrack. Each track fits well with the theme of the memories on display, and never feels at odds with the tone. Without this exact soundtrack, theres little doubt that the experience in Laserlife would be far less ethereal-feeling. Some have suggested the soundtrack is boring, which is likely the case if you despise the low-key, repetitive nature of this genre. For me, though, it was most certainly a joy getting wrapped up in the music and playing to the rhythm. Even after completing the game, this music is still worth a listen.With that said, there are design decisions which impinge the concept and ensure that it never reaches the heights it was nearly capable of attaining. First, theres the controls. Why is there no way to reconfigure or rebind keys? As it currently stands, players with smaller hands will find the death grip they need to place on a controller to rapidly hit triggers and simultaneously manipulate analog sticks to be quite painful after a few minutes of play. Luckily, only the first stage of any level requires trigger usage, while the latter two stages simply necessitate analog stick control. Its also possible to lessen the strain on your hands by playing on the easiest difficulty but fans who love to challenge themselves will find this a poor solution to the problem.The biggest issue, however, is Laserlifes continued reuse of the first stage in each chapter of memories. There are only three main chapters to speak of, all about wrapping up after just two hours of play. Given that this experience is so short, one should expect that at no point are stages reused  but they are. Youll be required to play the same level with the same exact song and visuals three times in a row before it changes in the next chapter. Perhaps it would have really utilized too many resources to make each unique, but its quite the unfortunate misstep to see so much reuse. Closing Comments: Laserlife had immense potential. Choice Provisions created a game that only they could make, but they did so in a way which doesnt feel complete. There is nothing inherently wrong with short games. Theres also nothing wrong with presenting an out there concept  in fact, its often the best choice. Where Laserlife disappoints is in its inability to be a wholly unique experience from beginning to end. With the reuse of visuals and music for the first level, as well as a very samey third level across all stages and chapters, the magic quickly wears out. Instead of being enraptured from the first to last minute, players will be left flustered by reappearing segments which sandwich the far more enchanting memory scenes. It feels like clutter, and in a two hour title, that leaves little time for truly magical moments.", "date": "September 29, 2015", "grade": 2.5}
