{"name": "The Everyday Tales of a Cat God", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=47053", "text": "The Everday Tales of a Cat God is one of the latest series to hit Western shores from NIS America. While there are countless anime in the wild, many of which never get localized  at least not on this level  its odd that NISA would put their efforts into such a humble, slice of lice comedy like Tales of a Cat God. But despite its unassuming approach, this series is one that is filled with plenty laughs and debauchery. But with the good comes some bad. How does it all weigh out?The Everyday Tales of a Cat God tells the story of Mayu, a brash god of the feline descent who has been banished to Earth after coming under fire for her various antics and mischievous behavior within the holy realm. Cast down to the mortal realm, Mayu has also been stripped of her powers, only able to use the stingiest of spells from her proverbial grimoire. However, because Mayu is the god of lost items and forgotten memories, her limited set of divine enchantments come in handy on more than one occasion, as those powers actually translate to a relative degree of practicality in the human world. Nevertheless, Mayu isnt the only god featured in Everyday Tales  in fact she surrounds herself with an entourage of various other gods, some of which are cats as well.The grouping of personalities is certainly one of Tales strongest aspects. Characters are lively and rambunctious, with physical appearances that expertly depict their personalities. By the by, the cast is eclectic and due to their clashing temperaments, provide more than a few laughs in their ridiculous interactions. And really, this is the heart of Tales viewing experience. Because the series is set up in a non-episodic manner, it lacks of a core central story. Consequently, each episode almost feels like an extended sketch where the characters have a conflict and must work together to find some kind of resolution. Throughout the process, they face an assortment of hurdles which act as backdrops for the light-hearted comedy to occur. There are plenty of gags, pranks, clowning around and general absurdity that all comes together into a brilliant concoction of humor that is at times laugh-out-loud funny. Some of the goofiness may only hit the slight chuckle level (and sometimes failing to hit the mark entirely), but by the by, the humor here is genuine and divvied out in hearty portions.Part of what makes the show such comedic gold is the wonderful translation work. Its been a while since Ive seen a subtitle job done this effectively. The writing is crisp with punctuation that makes line deliveries all the more humorous. An anime comedy can really go south if the localization efforts are half-hearted. Fortunately, that is never once the case with Cat Gods.Disappointing, then, is the fact that the silly nature of the show often overshadows other elements such as sound character development. The truth of it is the majority of the cast in Tales is grossly under-realized. With the exception of a few scenes that flesh out the human girl who Mayu lives with, Yuzu, there is hardly any type of real emotional connection to the lot. This ultimately makes the show feel more like a slideshow of funny scenes with caricatures as the stars, rather than rounded out personalities. As a slice of life series, however, this can be somewhat forgiven, but when put side-by-side with other like-series such as Galaxy Angel, Love Hina or even Sakura Diaries to a lesser extent, it pales in comparison.Nevertheless, the low-key tone of the show as a whole will be appreciated by those who arent looking for a series that requires much of a commitment. Because episodes are kept light and fluffy, and due to the lack of needing to understand complex characters, Everday Tales of a Cat God is an extremely easy watch. The breezy, dont-take-things-too-seriously pitch of the show makes it a good supplementary series, or show that viewers pop in from time to time, never in a rush to get to the end of its twelve-episode run.But The Everyday Tales of a Cat God is more than just its story. Its a rather pretty series with a color palette thats vibrant and lush. Line work is smooth and the clarity of picture is what weve come to expect of anime in high definition. The variety of set pieces all look wonderful as well with characters interacting with them frequently, making it feel like their actually part of the world theyre in, rather than just on some kind of stage with a host of props.So Tales of a Cat God looks good, but it doesnt aesthetically please like it does acoustically. The soundtrack, especially the closing theme, is incredibly bouncy and fun, adequately capturing the charm and spirit of the cute little show. Even aside from the opening and closing tunes, the music throughout is just all-around a treat to listen to. It isnt going to break new ground, but it surely will plant itself firmly in ones head for a few days. The audio outside of the OST is solid and remarkably crisp, too. There isnt an English dub in sight, but purists (who are probably the ones willing to search out this somewhat niche show) wont mind that.If consumers decide to pick up NISAs premium collection of the game, they will be treated to a few extras. For starters, theres an OVA episode that takes place post-series for those wanting a bit more of the story and characters. On top of that, there are seven mini-episodes for shorter viewing experiences. And lastly, theres a hardcover art book thats really quite beautiful. The book is arranged as if a scrapbook and is in full-color with plenty of sketches, images and a complete episode guide.Closing Comments:", "date": "July 6, 2013", "grade": 3.5}
