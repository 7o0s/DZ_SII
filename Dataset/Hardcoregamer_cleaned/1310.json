{"name": "Impossible Creatures Steam Edition", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=177311", "text": "Even as early as 2003, when Relics Impossible Creatures was first released, critics and gamers had started to complain that the gameplay mechanics of real time strategy games had become stale and overly familiar. The first wave of pioneering RTS games such as Total Annihilation and Dune had been succeeded by middle period masterpieces such as Age of Empires and Starcraft. By 2003  a year which also saw the release of Warcraft 3 and Rise of Nations  the tropes of RTS games had become ossified. With some minor variations, resource gathering, base building, structures and upgrades, unit types and unit movement were fundamentally the same in Starcraft, Age of Empires 2 and Rise of Nations. While the simple, 1:1, rock-paper-scissors relationship between enemy units of the first RTS games had been complicated by games with three or more factions, the idea of units and counter-units remained fundamental.A couple of games in 2003 challenged the ho-hum RTS status quo. Warcraft 3 introduced the idea of persistent hero units and Impossible Creatures made it seemingly possible to design and construct hundreds of different unit types from the DNA of animals found in the environment. Creatures lengthy single player campaign centers on an adventurer named Rex Chance, who is trying to find his missing father. Rex stumbles on the nefarious genetic research that his father had been conducting for a criminal mastermind, Upton Julius. Together with his female sidekick Lucy Willing, Rex sets out for revenge. The hokey names are an immediate clue that the story is not a serious one.In 2003, it was still relatively rare for an RTS game to feature a fully voiced and acted story, and Impossible Creatures is gifted with one that is generally well written, witty, and professionally voiced. Its all done in a campy, 1930s pulp fiction style, and the generally excellent, competently directed in-engine cut scenes are only marred by some pretty blocky, low-res character models. Even in 2003, they couldnt have looked great. Some of the humor strikes a politically incorrect note in 2015, but many of the jokes stick their landing. On the other hand, the repetitive nature of the disembodied narration becomes grating. Ok, we get it, our animals are being attacked. Impossible Creatures big hookthe ability to mix and match animal parts to create units that are unique and effective in battlecreates some interesting, unexpected units but thanks to the random element, also sacrifices the fine-tuned gameplay that comes from purposeful, developer-tuned design. There is seemingly much to consider when designing a creature, too. Even small tweaks (like choosing which head or tail to use) have an impact on stats. Despite this, animals are still grouped into basic typesessentially melee animals, area-of-attack animals, flying units, etc. Looked at this way, it suddenly sounds far less unfamiliar.While its undeniably fun to engineer a lion with a skunks tail and ability to shoot stinky clouds, or craft a giraffe with porcupine quills, the actual skirmisheswhether in the single player campaign or in multiplayer matchesare simply not that visceral or exciting. Whether its due to the aging visuals or the fact that the creatures just never really connect during battle, it just comes across as a great idea that wasnt quite fully realized, then or since. With so many reboots, remixes, sequels, and do-overs populating the gaming landscape, the core premise of Impossible Creatures cries out for a current gen treatment. Its just such a cool idea. In 2003, anyone who was remotely familiar with real time strategy games would have had no trouble picking up and playing Impossible Creatures basic, mainstream RTS mechanics. Selecting and moving units, creating unit hotkeys, gathering resources (really, only two) and building structures all follow the established rules. Rules, it should be noted, that are fundamentally the same twelve years later. The missions in the single player campaign are long and contain multiple, sequential objectives, but there is a repetitive element as well, as many inevitably start with an early enemy rush and the need to pump out some cheap, defensive units. Pathfinding and friendly unit AI is a little hit or miss. Both work most of the time.The Steam Edition looks sharp and runs great, and includes all the original games later, add-on content and a map editor. The multiplayer works fine, the excellent jazz-influenced music is still impressively jaunty, and with upcoming (rumored) Steam Workshop support, maybe someone will be inspired to reskin the whole thing. At only $5.99, there is a lot of fun to be had with the game, even if the feeling of appreciation is just a little muted by disappointment with the execution and aging graphics. Closing Comments:Limitations aside, Impossible Creatures still feels unique and is definitely worth playing. Fans of Spore will enjoy the creature building and younger players whose only RTS experience is the current Starcraft trilogy might appreciate the simple, straightforward and uncluttered gameplay. Of course, those who played  and maybe forgot  the original are in for a nice bit of inexpensive nostalgia.", "date": "November 14, 2015", "grade": 3.5}
