Mojangs simple little game has become not just a favorite among preteen gamers (and gamers of all ages), but a genuine cultural phenomenon, spawning dozens of respectful imitators and downright ripoffs. When FortressCraft appeared on the Xbox 360 in 2011, Mojang founder Markus Persson and FortressCraft developer Adam Sawkins had a contentious and public battle about how closely Sawkins game resembled Minecraft. There is certainly more than a passing resemblance, though four years later and now using the Unity engine, FortressCraft has evolved into much more of its own product.All the voxel block building games  just like physical blocks  tap into that primal human need to make something. Its just inherently satisfying to take simple raw materials and craft something cool, whether its a sand castle on the beach or a thousand piece Lego diorama, making the success of Minecraft or Space Engineer or FortressCraft is entirely understandable. And, since by now just about everyone has some familiarity with the block building genre, its probably just best to talk about how FortressCraft Evolved differs from or improves upon the formula, if it actually does. Although the game was highly successful on Xbox 360, moving to PC and the Unity engine gives FortressCraft Evolved all sorts of graphical upgrades from the console version when it comes to lighting and weather effects, draw distances, and texture complexity. Bragging about a bump in visual complexity and richness is a little ironic, considering that the original Minecraft was in part a post-modern reaction to the industrys obsession with graphical fidelity over gameplay. Stylistically, FortressCraft Evolved has a slightly sci-fi, definitely mechanical vibe, as one of the games biggest hooks is the emphasis on building machinery, conveyor belt-driven automated laser-firing ore extractors, and other sorts of cool Rube Goldberg assemblies. Another interesting feature allows the player to use the Workshop  the worlds central building hub  to craft a scale model of a building or room and then have the Workshop fabricate a full sized version. Just like that other Craft game, everything comes down to blocks, either mined and culled from the environment, unlocked during game play or specially created by the player. Eventually, once its systems are understood, FortressCraft Evolved allows a great deal of creativity and design freedom. A cursory perusal of YouTube suggests that there are many dedicated FortressCrafter-ers out there and theyve made some amazing things.Although one of FortressCraft Evolveds bullet point is an easy to use UI, in fact the game is anything but welcoming to new players and is downright offputting. The tutorial level is dark, hard to navigate and doesnt really explain game systems. Its all too easy to die of hypothermia while simply learning the how and why of simple operations. Of course with time comes the eventual understanding of how ore and other raw materials are converted to power, which then drives other more complex systems. The UI does become more familiar but many tasks involve multiple submenus and combination keystrokes. On PC, the game only partially supports the controller and is best played with mouse and keyboard. The official Wiki isnt all that helpful, either. Like Minecraft, Evolved can be played in a forgiving, death-free sandbox mode or in the new Survival Mode, where the player must contend with all manner of natural and unnatural forces and enemies, such as waves of aliens. Mining for rare materials to construct a series of defensive structures connected to a power grid adds a unique tower defense aspect to Survival Mode and is at its best when played co-op. Closing Comments:FortressCraft Evolved has moved from being a block builder clone to something unique, especially in Survival Mode, which can be played like a multi-faceted tower defense game. FortressCraft Evolved contains the seeds to nurture creativity and imaginative play, but its first few hours are abysmally confusing and its UI is in dire need of a do-over. Not an especially charming or friendly take on the genre, FortressCraft Evolved has a lot of depth and potential for the dedicated player.", "date": "November 19, 2015", "grade": 3.0}
