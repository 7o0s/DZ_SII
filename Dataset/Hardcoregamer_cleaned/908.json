As Target Earth, it became a bit of a sleeper hit in North America  and a game that helped set Genesis owners apart. If someone just had Sonic and the like, you know they enjoyed it on one level  while owners of Target Earth were known as a different breed of gamer. To just see someone excel at it was an accomplishment because it threw so much at you and all you had was your loadout and a shield to protect you. Now, the game has been rebuilt with a more modern control setup in mind and its astonishing to think of the game even being playable on a three button controller after playing it with a modern stick setup.Assault Suit Leynos tests your mettle from the beginning, but is far more forgiving now than it was 25 years ago. You have a tutorial to learn the ropes and youll want to make use of it liberally. Going in blind without even checking the digital manual is asking for a quick demise. While the idea of a game where you pilot a mech and shoot things may seem simplistic, theres a lot of nuance to it. You need to make careful use of your loadouts, and try to balance things out. Going for an offense-heavy setup might be okay, but leaving yourself more vulnerable than you have to is asking for trouble.Trial and error is going to be your most valuable tool in this game because you will have to fail in order to eventually succeed. However, you will learn quickly because even on easy mode, rivals dont give you much breathing room. Every level is a balancing act of offense and defense. Sometimes, you will need to deflect shots with your shield and then immediately fire back at a swarm of enemies. Other stages will pit you against enemies from above that force you to lock the gun in place before unleashing Hell upon your enemies. Locking its position allows you to move in any direction while still attacking  so if rivals are coming at you from the left-hand side of the screen, you can shift to the right and still attack them while moving around and making use of platforming skills at the same time. It takes a small amount of time to retrain your brain to shift from the usual left-to-right norm in gaming, but you do get acclimated fairly quickly. Youll need to adapt in order to take out enemies from above and then next to you one right after the other  you arent given time to rest.However, that doesnt mean the game is purely non-stop action. It is mostly that, yes, but there are smaller moments where you have to escort allies and think even more before you act. If they die, then you still fail as if you had died, so you need to figure out the right mix of escorting them along and also attacking enemies. Going on ahead may be a solid first instinct, but it can open the group up to more damage. Fortunately, NPCs usually assist in escort missions as well  generally taking care of one side of the action so you can handle the other. Its a solid system and one that helps break the trend of one versus all in gaming. Here, youre a very important part of the group  but that group still has your back when its able to.The default button layout is logical and easy to remember in the heat of battle. Your bumpers act as gun-locking and shield-usage buttons, while the face buttons attack and zoom you around with the dash feature. You can move with either the left stick or a d-pad, but we found that using a stick worked better given how many positions you can move your gun into. Everything is responsive and you can customize the layout to suit your needs if you want to. While the game itself is tough, the control setup is very user-friendly and ensures that every death will generally be your fault.There are times when the revamped graphics can be to blame though  at least to some degree. The revamped graphics are an overall improvement over the originals  which were sub-par in their day. Now, the graphics have been rebuilt and been given a huge upgrade. Details levels are much greater for allies, enemies, foreground, and backgrounds. The worlds actually look fully-developed now, with intricate background art. Explosions have become a bit too crazy though  with some practically filling the screen. This is fine if the action ever actually stopped, but it never really does. You just wind up with an obscured view and hope to either aim or block properly to avoid a game over. Other than the overly-frantic moments though, Assault Suit Leynos delivers the goods visually.It doesnt do that when it comes to its soundtrack, sadly. Everything has an action-y vibe to it, which is good  but none of it excites you. The Japanese voice acting with English subtitles approach is different for the genre, and one that works out reasonably well. The voice acting doesnt seem amazing, but there is great conviction to it and that does let you know that things are serious. The explosions and many blasting sound effects are the most important things for a game like this, and theyre done very well.Closing Comments:Assault Suit Leynos is exactly what a remake should be. It takes everything that worked about the original and improves upon it with modern flourishes. The original was fine for its time, but with greatly-improved controls and graphics, everything is more enjoyable now than it was then. Its also a far more user-friendly experience thanks to an extensive tutorial system and manages to remain extremely challenging because it never walks you through anything  it merely teaches you the ropes and expects you to remember everything.", "date": "August 9, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
