{"name": "Forward to the Sky", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=132656", "text": "Forward to the Sky is an adventure platformer that takes inspiration from The Legend of Zelda, but to make this review as painless (for the game) as possible, its probably best to not even make comparisons to Nintendos benchmark for 3D adventure platforming. Forward to the Sky takes place in some ruins in the sky, where a princess ventures forth with her hot air balloon to collect crystals and stop an apparent evil witch. Last year we shared our impressions of a very early build of the title, which was really just a game-engine test and not a real indication of what the game itself would end up being like. It had the mechanics and ideas on display at least, and it was just a matter of constructing some real levels and bringing it all together into a cohesive game.Not much has happened between the last build and this finished product thats now on Steam and playing Forward to the Sky will make you wonder if its is still in Alpha testing. Sadly, what you see is what the team decided was complete enough to end up on Steam and charge people money for. I respect aspiring game developers chasing a dream and creating something out of passion and games that were created with limited budget and resources. Examples of excellent games coming from small and green teams  and using little money  are quite plentiful now, which is why Forward to the Sky wont get any special treatment here.When one-man masterpiece game creations exist, its hard to go easy on Forward to the Sky despite it being paved with good intentions. Theres just so many better designed and produced content on Steam more deserving of the eight dollars that Forward to the Sky feels its worthy of. If someone thought that this was a complete video game, then so was Bubsy 3D by that logic.What youre presented with is a vague prototype of an idea for a game, something that a lot of people thought would be fit to be on Steam for purchase. Honestly, this Steam Greenlight system needs to be better regulated, but its not like Steam or Valve are responsible for what passes through. Its the people that decide to have the likes of Forward to the Sky and Hatoful Boyfriend get the Greenlight approval. Forward to the Sky is over before you know it, featuring just six short levels with the entire game clocking in at just under an hour. With some semblance of a level design and a new design gimmick in each level, theres some attempt at puzzles and platforming , but in the end theyre just thrown in without any effort to create something meaningful. Some puzzles and enemy encounters are just there for the sake of it, and you could just bypass most of the content and shoot for the exit. Theres platforming, switch puzzles, morphing platforms and some ideas that could have been used to create something cool, but instead it feels like each level is merely testing those ideas and mechanics.The sixth level serves as a boss battle, the one and only boss in a game that has the bare minimum variety of enemies that were thrown in without much thought. The enemies are all skeletal warriors  their placement sparse and far-between  and you almost dont have to deal with them. The boss battle against the witch follows a few interesting patterns, but the choppy and incomplete animations makes it an unsatisfying finale to a below-underwhelming experience.The whole thing feels unfinished. Theres weird glitches, collision detection issues and sloppy animations, but at least the camera and controls are somewhat functional enough to help you get through what feels like a short demo. The combat and mechanics work to some extent, but they feel too basic and stiff. There just isnt enough variety, and there is barely any fluidity to get around enemies, not to mention a dodge button thats useless given the strange hit-detection. Theres nothing entirely broken about the mechanics and systems, its just all undeveloped.The visuals reinforce the notion of Forward to the Sky being a prototype than anything else. There is little visual variety, the textures are bland and boring and only the main character resembles anything thats finished. The background music is somewhat decent at least, but the voice acting is anything but. Remember how in the old days when video game characters were dubbed by people hanging around the office or on the street? Thats the kind of quality voice work that Forward to the Sky has to offer.Closing Comments:Forward to the Sky is the prototype of an idea that ended up being released as a finished product. A lack of experience and budget in this day and age simply arent excuses to charge people money for something that is barely developed. Game development is becoming increasingly saturated, and there are enough examples to prove that greatness can be achieved if a well designed and polished title is made however limited it may be, but Forward to the Sky is unfortunately just a mere semblance of a video game and nothing more. Forward to the Sky may have wanted to reach for the skies, but it needed to dig out of the ground first.", "date": "February 3, 2015", "grade": 1.0}
