{"name": "Mousecraft", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=92943", "text": "Let me stop you right there; this isnt like Minecraft. No, Mousecraft is a different kind of odd. The self-described cheesiest game ever  get it  cheesy  mice  okay whatever  might not live up to that moniker and all it implies, but at least its not a building simulator with rodents. I imagine somewhere along the line the developers looked at other puzzle games that had success doing something simple with great execution and said were not going to settle for that.The goal of Mousecraft is to guide three AI-controlled mice across a level to some cheese by filling gaps and building bridges with a few select Tetris blocks. Simple enough. Well now you need to make sure they collect some crystals along the way. All right, a little deeper  I like it. Well now you need to do so while avoiding mechanical mice that explode on contact. Now were getting somewhere. Well now you need to blow up the right blocks using a limited number of bombs. While were at it, lets add in blocks that break a mouses fall, and blocks that blow up after contact and blocks that zap and kill mice on contact, and hey why not some water mice can drown in?It keeps going deeper. I did find ways to circumvent that depth, which was disappointing at first, but Mousecraft made up for that too. So much of this depth is added to make it harder to get the crystals. Smugly, I thought what do I care about those crystals if I can get my mice to the cheese without worrying about them? My hubris The game divides all the levels into four stages. Like a fee to Charon at the River Styx, crystals are the ticket to the next stage. Not enough crystals? Go back and try again. Sure there are several ways to complete a level, but only one right way, and Mousecraft succeeds in incentivising and coercing the player to find it.On the other side, though, more Hell awaits. Sneaky ferryman. Dont expect the game to get easier as it goes on; the constant addition of elements makes it impossible to get really good at playing within the rules, because the rules keep changing. Right after Mousecraft added the zapping blocks, I got to a level where I didnt even know where to start. But Mousecraft could have upped the ante with the crystal requirement for each stage. By the last stage, I didnt even try to get crystals sometimes because I didnt need them.Mousecraft is a substantial game. By that I mean its freaking huge. The game is 80 levels, many of which you need to scroll sideways to see entirely. This adds to the daunting appearance of each level, which makes it tempting to take the much easier path of shutting down the game, but we persist. It made me feel like one of the mice I was guiding, mindlessly heading toward the cheese without regard for my own well-being (and sanity).Back to the point about the cheesiest game claim. Developer Crunching Koalas may have something with that joke, in that they have the most cheese, and it starts out well introducing the cat scientist named Schrodinger, but that same humor didnt really get carried over for the rest of the game. Although the gameplay was enjoyable and challenging, the game itself was almost atonal, a disappointment for a game with such potential for comedy.Mousecraft puts you in the shoes of the Schrodinger cat so well that, much like a scientist in a lab, youll need to experiment with different possibilities to see what will work. What will happen if I lead the mice this way by putting this brick here? Why would the game give me exploding bricks to place? Since Mousecraft doesnt boot you back to the menu or cause a loading screen when you fail, restarting a level is faster than refreshing a page on the internet, so theres not much fault in killing a few mice to test out a theory.Closing Comments:", "date": "July 8, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
