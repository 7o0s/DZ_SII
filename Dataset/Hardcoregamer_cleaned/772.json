{"name": "Pixel Gear (PSVR)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=231570", "text": "The PlayStation VRs launch window lineup has been largely stellar  with a surprisingly high level of diversity and quality across the board. Some games, like Hatsune Miku, are an acquired taste  but theyre well executed. The PSVRs use of the Move controllers hasnt just led to folks dusting them off from the PS3 days, but also new applications of the technology. Batman: Arkham VR uses them to make you feel like Batman, while shooters can use them to provide more accurate-feeling gun controls. Pixel Gear does just that while providing PSVR owners the first wave-based shooter on the device.This pixel art-style game stands out immediately thanks to its graphics, but holds up over time thanks to its rock-solid shooting action. A single Move controller is all you need to have fun, and success is as simple as aiming your reticle and firing away. You want to be careful when you aim though, because your default six shooter does take some time reload. Accuracy ensures that youll be more efficient, and that can mean the difference between life and death when things get hectic. Its one thing to just aim and hope for the best  youll do okay with that strategy, but not for long.Headshots are the key to victory, and will be the only way to defeat armored enemies. Some also lob things at you, while small bats fly overhead with pumpkin bombs. Youll wind up wanting to take out the bats at just the right time so that their bombs fall on the enemies on the ground  freeing up a couple of shots for you to do more damage. Your playing field is fairly large and goes from whats right in front of you to areas off to your right and left. Enemies can creep up out of nowhere, so keep a sharp eye on your health bar. Ghosts can fly up with either coins, ammo, or hearts while angels are things you dont want to hit  and basically act as civilians would in an old light gun game. You will definitely hit them, but wont want to for score purposes. Fortunately, this is a highly replayable game. In theory, it would be a great one to spend a little bit of time on and then just go back to whenever you want  but Pixel Gears structure is a bit odd because you can only save after bosses. This means that play sessions that you intend to be only 15 minutes or so are suddenly in the 30-45 minute range and thats a bit much. Hopefully a patch is released that amends this issue. Doing well with the ghosts and netting a bunch of coins can allow you to get a slew of other weapons. Machine guns are useful, but rely on you also getting regular ammo pickups to do much good. Extended clips are an option, but not a guarantee after a stage. The grenade gun is a godsend and does a ton of damage quickly  but its short ammo count means its probably best served for bosses that have several weak points over a small area. The sniper rifle is a godsend for long-range, but can be a bit tricky to aim with the Move controller since youre also using your VR as a scope and its tough to keep everything aligned. Still, aiming as a whole is outstanding and it will be exciting to see some light gun-style games come to PSVR as time goes on.Pixel Gears use of 3D pixel art gives it a style that should allow it to age quite nicely. The execution is very similar to 3D Dot Game Heroes on the PlayStation 3, but with far less shading and lighting effects. This results in a slightly more bland look compared to that game, but this also allows everything to look clean on-screen and that makes it much easier to see everything going on. Colors are bright and bold, so you wont ever have to worry about enemies blending into something else in the background. Since you can move around your physical space too, you can also get a slightly better view and angle on enemies that may otherwise seem just outside your reach too.Theres a lot to like about the games overall presentation  and its gun sound effects are one of its best parts. Every gun sounds a bit different and the default six shooter sounds absolutely vile. Its a powerhouse shot, while the faster-paced guns sound less damaging  but do more damage at a faster rate of speed. The games chiptune soundtrack works very well and fits in perfectly with the art style. The voxel look and retro-inspired music combine to form something that works very well. None of it is all-time great music, but its enjoyable in the game and something that will have you humming as you play. Closing Comments:Pixel Gear is another bright spot in the PlayStation VRs lineup. This digital-only release gives players some of the best shooting action on the device so far and is great to break up RIGS play sessions for when you still want to do some shooting, but want something a bit more relaxing. This style of game is ideal for short play sessions  which is why its a bit odd that it doesnt save after every level and only does so after boss battles. Other than that issue, though, the core concept is well executed and the shooting is quick and precise. Its a must-buy for anyone who loves light gun games, or just wants something that really tests their reflexes.", "date": "October 21, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
