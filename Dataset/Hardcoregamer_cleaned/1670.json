{"name": "Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy+", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=135372", "text": "Bandai Namco Games released Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy on 3DS back in 2011, a remake of the PlayStation title Ace Combat 2. Four years later, the Japanese company updated the game with an entirely new release. However, unlike other incremental updates like Soul Sacrifice Delta or Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy+ brings very little unique content to the table and hits some considerable turbulence along the way.As Phoenix, leader of the Scarface Squadron, its your duty to deploy in various warzones throughout the world and duel the Allied Forces. Theres very little to the story, and it quickly becomes a generic, forgettable, and boring frame for the aerial combat youre there for. Voice acting helps to add at least a sprinkle of color to the proceedings, but terribly bland writing and frustratingly flat characters almost guarantee utter disinterest in the stretches of text between missions.Luckily, the game picks up significantly once you hop in the cockpit. Most missions require you to shoot down a certain number of enemy aircraft, along with the odd four-wheeled vehicle or boat. Thats great for awhile, but the lack of significant variety quickly makes the experience feel a lot less daring and lot more generic. Several times during the campaign youre given a choice between two different mission types, usually aimed at allowing players to avoid certain missions they dont care for, but even that agency cant rescue the games forgettable campaign.One of ACAHL+s greatest strengths is its environmental detail. Snow-capped mountain peaks look spectacular and sunny ocean views glisten beautifully, but the game is also plastered with some pretty unattractive textures. Youll rarely notice them while controlling the skies, but certain missions actually implore you to swoop near the ground, and thats when the ugly underbelly of the Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy+ comes into view. What appeared to possess some semblance of detail and depth from above is revealed to have nothing of the sort once you dip down to explore it, and it makes the few three-dimensional elements of the environment look jarringly out of place.Flying itself is great fun, and the games plane models are all perfectly articulate. Youll see your aircrafts engine heat up when you accelerate and tail flaps react to the movement of the circle pad; it all makes for a surprisingly realistic visual experience. The controls are well-tuned, too, and you really feel the differences between planes. The games combat takes a more arcade-like approach, thankfully removing the more tedious and frustrating elements featured in more realistic flight simulators. Victory is basically dependent on your ability to get behind an enemy, but the only really viable means of doing so is relegated to an embarrassingly easy quick-time event. It removes much of the skill, challenge, and fun of besting your opponents, and to make matters worse, the flashy flying cutscenes that set up your finishing blows largely dont even make sense in context. Theyre needless and overused, and kill any remaining satisfaction of pulling off a sweet maneuver. It would be one thing if you looped over your opponent in-game before blasting them to pieces, but the cutscenes actually take you out of the action, and thats a shame.Despite those issues, each mission in ACAHL+ still manages to feel at least slightly exciting thanks to the games stirring soundtrack. Most tracks are beautifully composed orchestral numbers, instilling tangible and desperately needed emotion into the action. The fights still feel repetitive, but the games sweeping, uplifting soundtrack really saves it from stalling mid-air. The experience is also enhanced while using the 3DSs stereoscopic 3D, which adds noticeable depth and detail to the battlefield. Strangely, however, I found the mission briefing segments consistently nauseating, a problem Id never encountered in a 3DS game before.Despite the titles added Plus subtitle, Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy+ doesnt really add or change much in comparison to the original. The most notable addition is the collection of Nintendo-inspired planes, which can be collected both in-game and by tapping amiibos on a New 3DS XL. The designs are admittedly sweet, but they dont quite justify repurchasing the game for those who played the 2011 original. The controls have also been tweaked to take advantage of the New 3DS XLs expanded button inputs, but they make little to no difference in the overall experience. Bandai Namco Games is really trying to pull a fast one with this release. Unless you simply must shoot your enemies out of the sky in the colors of the Big N, there really isnt any reason to revisit the campaign.Of course, that story might have been different if Bandai Namco Games added multiplayer to this updated version, but alas Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy+ goes begging just like its predecessor. Without it, the games 5-hour campaign feels considerably unsubstantial, especially as its completely unchanged from its 2011 counterpart. However, there is some considerable depth available for those looking to customize their aircraft. Completing missions and defeating enemies gains you experience and unlocks new planes, parts, and paint jobs, but while some players may enjoy tweaking their planes to their particular style, the lack of multiplayer means theyll never get a chance to test them against other players.Closing Comments:Fans of the Ace Combat series are destined to be disappointed with Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy+. Aside from some small control additions and swanky new amiibo support, the aerial combat game is largely unchanged from Bandai Namco Games initial 3DS release in 2011. The flying itself is decent, and greatly enhanced by the games outstanding soundtrack, but ultimately Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy+ feels like nothing more than a poorly-disguised cash-grab.", "date": "February 20, 2015", "grade": 3.0}
