{"name": "Orgarhythm", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=16545", "text": "Orgarhythm may sound like an item sold at MVC, but its actually an RTS/Rhythm game hybrid. It begins with one of the most beautiful credits sequences Ive seen in gaming with some awesome thumping music that will be stuck in your head for a while. After that bit of greatness, you can choose to either dive head-first into the campaign, take on some opponents in either local or ad-hoc multiplayer, change some options, check the in-game database for info, or partake in some tutorials.Unless youd like to be slaughtered immediately, start with that. The core game combines RTS mechanics with rhythm gaming  kind of like Patapon, but with a more traditional RTS 3/4 overhead viewpoint. As the God of Light, youll command your troops against the God of Darknesss many minions. Battle begins by tapping him, then choosing which of his three sets of troops youd like to send into battle. Each one is based on an element, with a rock-scissors-paper mechanic in place to determine who you should send in. If youre facing Earth-based enemies with yellow bars, youll want to send in the red-barred Fire troops, who are vulnerable to the blue-barred Water enemies. You can choose how many of the troops to send in by drawing a line. A short line sends one troop, while longer ones will send more out to do battle. If youre against just one enemy, you may not want to send in a lot of troops, but if youre facing a slew of folks, youll want to send in more.The battle mechanics may sound difficult to learn, but after some trial and error, they become second-nature fairly quickly. I havent played an RTS game in many years, but found Orgarythms battle system to be very user-friendly and easy to learn after only a few minutes. This handy trailer not only explains the battle system, but showcases just how rhythm plays a part in it and should put any doubts potential players have about the genre blending to rest.Pressing the God of Light, or issuing any command in perfect harmony with the music, allows for faster leveling-up. While a challenge in itself, the greatest feat (beyond the AI) comes from getting into such a groove that you can actually rattle off every command needed in a fraction of a second to get the jump on enemies and really boost your levels. Its one of the games most rewarding aspects and makes you feel like youve really accomplished something when you get the hang of it. Theres more to combat than just sending certain troops out against others; secondary support abilities to help against enemies when the God of Lights health has been depleted to its last third also exist. Carefully tapping a silver icon instead of the usual bright red, yellow, and blue ones takes a turn or two to get used to, but yields some awesome features. By taking your time, youll be able to increase your offensive or defensive capabilities, get some much-needed health back, slow enemies, or even BLAST THEM WITH LIGHTNING.One great thing about how Orgarhythms battle system is crafted is that audio cues dont have to be relied on to do well  visual cues are given for the proper rhythm. Each beat causes a circular pattern to appear around whatever needs to be tapped, slowly evaporating as the beat goes on. When that circle is completely gone, you know its safe to tap and still get an excellent rating. This is ideal for playing on a bus, or in a car, or any other setting where you get the urge to play the game, but still have to keep your ears open for something.Thankfully, when youre able to play it with the audio on, youre in for a treat. As one might expect from something with a rhythm theme (and a really awesome intro song), Orgarhythms soundtrack is really good. Its got a lot of tribal music, tons of drums, and even a bit of rock thrown in. Its pretty diverse and the intro music alone had me wish a soundtrack album was available to download on PSN. Unfortunately, the graphics dont quite stand out as much as the music. Theyre far from bad, but have a generic RTS look that just isnt very distinct. While a bright color scheme helps keep track of things in battle, environments can be a bit muddy when not masked by the great lighting effects.Closing Comments:", "date": "October 26, 2012", "grade": 4.0}
