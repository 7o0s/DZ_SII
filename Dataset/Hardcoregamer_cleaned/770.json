{"name": "SUPERHYPERCUBE (PSVR)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=231585", "text": "When you think of virtual reality experiences, what usually come to mind includes action-packed sequences and exploring expansive fictional worlds. As it turns out, the puzzle genre fits right in with VR. Anyone who needs proof only needs to take SUPERHYPERCUBE for a spin. Like all good puzzlers, this one provides a simple concept that proves both challenging and utterly engrossing. The big difference, of course, is that all this goes on within the PlayStation VR headset, resulting in one of the trippiest puzzle titles out there. Does it truly make use of this technology to make the game demand its VR exclusivity? The games basic premise revolves around the player turning and fitting a shape into a cutout within a wall. Initially, the shape players must work with is a single cube. After making it through the first wall, however, more cubes are added onto the base cube. What this results in is an increasingly complex amalgamation of blocks that the player must manipulate around to continue to fit through walls. One difficult part of the gameplay is that your shape quickly grows large, completely blocking an easy view of the wall. If youve ever seen the show Hole in the Wall, it takes that concept and amplifies it further due to the nature of your ever-increasingly complex shape. How do you see the wall shape coming up, then? Simple! Move your head around and the PSVR/camera track this movement to give you a clear view beyond your shape. Its an extremely simple concept that, as of right now, would not be easy to translate to 2D gaming. After all, what makes this concept so good is that its natural and easy to look around objects. The same would not be as true or immediate if you mapped the movement to an analog stick instead. SUPERHYPERCUBE is also just plain difficult as, the more complex your shape becomes, the tougher it gets to find the correct shape in a short amount of time. Boss walls move as you near them, requiring even more precision to safely pass. There are a few ways to ease the challenge of SUPERHYPERCUBE. This comes in the form of two special abilities. Once charged, the player gets the option of pausing time or using a bomb. The time pausing ability in particular just makes perfect sense. It provides a few precious extra seconds to think. Even so, the tension never lets up. Temporary respite from an impending wall only delays the inevitable failure, after all. If your shape is only slightly off the wall will graze off a few blocks for you. On the other hand, another mistake will simply end a streak entirely. Theres one aspect of the game that really sells it beyond its addictive simple core mechanics: the visuals. SUPERHYPERCUBE looks like some ridiculously cool retro futuristic realm youve jumped into, with neon colors everywhere, and music thats slick, simple and doesnt overpower gameplay. Graphically simple games such as this one also look better on PSVR. Because of the limited resolution and texture detail available, SUPERHYPERCUBE still looks absolutely stylish whereas more realistic titles end up appearing muddy in comparison. Closing Comments:Sure, you might not find a bevy of modes or other activities to do within SUPERHYPERCUBE, but thats not the point. The core gameplay mechanic of fitting increasingly complex cube-based shapes into wall cutouts is plainly enjoyable. Its also incredibly challenging as you move through to later levels. It might not be a game you play for hours on end, but rather one you come back to week after week. Most other PSVR titles will not have that staying power, as many are experiences you play through only once or twice. SUPERHYPERCUBE is simple enough for all kinds of players to grasp, but addictive enough to keep folks coming back.", "date": "October 21, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
