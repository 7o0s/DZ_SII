{"name": "Soul Fjord (OUYA)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=72377", "text": "When it was announced that Kim Swift would be working on an OUYA game, some were a bit baffled  just what would Portals lead designer craft on the system? As it turns out, she and the folks at Airtight Games can craft one hell of a roguelike that isnt just fun for fans of that genre, but makes for a perfect gateway game in the genre due to how accessible it is. Since Soul Fjord (pronounced like fah-yord) was first shown off about six months ago, the game has gathered a fair amount of steam within the OUYA community. Its become one of the most-anticipated games for the platform, and with a system starved for top-level content, that can be a double-edged sword. High expectations make it much easier to be disappointed  a fate that thankfully doesnt befall Soul Fjord.This oddly-titled game stars Magnus Jones  a fro-loving viking trying to get into Club Valhala. To do so, hell have to slaughter tons of enemies while gathering items and weapons to aid him on his journey. The core gameplay is a bit of an overhead Legend of Zelda-style action RPG with roguelike elements and a rhythm mechanic that can mean the difference between a swift victory or an even faster defeat. While roaming the world attacking enemies, youll get a typical press a button when its in line with an on-screen circle prompt. Pressing the correct button, then the correct series of buttons for a combo elicits massive damage compared to a basic shot. Youve got light and heavy attacks by default with light mapped to O and heavy mapped to U, and need to mix them up effectively to win.Just attacking without nailing the rhythm will do some damage, but its minor compared to what it is when you nail the timing  and youll need to get that right if you hope to make serious progress. Fortunately, youre given a shield to aid you, but just like your sword (or fro-wearing staff), it also relies on rhythm to be effective. Instead of pressing an attack button, you can press a trigger button to maximize your shield. Doing so with a left stick movement allows you to dash. That may seem like an odd mechanic to have in a roguelike/action RPG, but it comes in handy for the crazy teleporting, lightning-shooting grannies, and sections that are full of death traps since the only way to catch up to the former and avoid the latter involves dashing at the exact right time.The control layout is easy to remember, with the bumpers allowing for quick healing item usage and the Y button acting as an even more powerful attack modifier if the conditions are right. Everythings nice and responsive most of the time, although turning Magnus could be a bit easier  he tends to take a split second longer than youd like to move him, which will hopefully be addressed in a future patch as it can lead to some needless damage. The action is shockingly fast for a roguelike game, with a steady stream of enemies making things challenging, and the incorporation of rhythm ensuring that you need to pay attention to do well. You cant really be passive and expect to succeed here. If you get lazy and take your eye off your health meter, you can find yourself dead in an instant. While you can souldbind items for later use, that does cost you a lot of records if you want to do it for a variety of items since its five per item and theyre somewhat rare during the main game. Youll get some for beating a boss and find a few in ice and amber sculptures, you cant count on them being common. Gold, on the other hand, is fairly common and thanks to frequent item drops, you can always sell stuff thats inferior to a merchant and stockpile it for rare goods. Youll want to make sure to use your items wisely too, and dont be afraid to use an XP booster in a tough fight instead of a healing item  if you do well enough with the rhythm, youll get enough XP to level up and refill your health bar alongside a boost in HP, so sometimes, its worth taking a risk like that in order to survive.Soul Fjords free-to-play model is just about perfect since the only thing youre ever asked to buy is records, and those can be found in the game. Youre not going to get a ton of them, and it does make the game harder as a result, but you could in theory get through the entire game just by being smart with attacking and blocking and simply using the records obtained through normal play to unlock either super-powerful item chests or soul bind a few items here and there. Realistically, you should at least spend $2 to get 12 records, and then get a few in the first few stages to save a few items  or you can opt to just save a couple of items and then take a chance opening a chest for some good loot. The pay model is quite fair and you never feel obligated to pay. If you want a more accurate roguelike experience, you can just go with permadeath as your motivation, but if you want things a little easier, the option is there for those who want it. It makes the game very user-friendly and solidifies Soul Fjord as a perfect gateway game for those intimidated by the roguelikes.The visual presentation is largely good. The wacky 70s border around the screen gives the whole game a vibe of the era even when the levels youre in are more gaming standards  the border manages to give you a bit of that Superfly-funk all all times, but isnt distracting even though in theory, it might seem like it would be. The character designs look bold and have a ton of detail to them. The environments are also full of detail and feature some of the best-looking textures on the OUYA so far. Little touches like having the equipment change be something visible as opposed to left to your imagination add a lot of comedy, since imagining Magnus with a Link-esque tunic is one thing  but seeing him with it and a wacky parasol-style shield is another. Soul Fjord is a fun game to look at with a ton of life to the world and the animation, even if there are some little lighting issues that obscure Magnus behind the bright lights when going from room to room. Its a fairly minor rough edge and one that never gets in the way of gameplay.Soul Fjords music feels straight out of the 70s, or maybe more of a DVD menu theme for a 70s movie. Its fun to listen to in the game, but isnt so good that itll have you preferring it to the Superfly soundtrack. In a strange bit given the rhythm-centric nature of the gameplay, button presses in time with the music mean nothing. While its a probably a good thing given how this is essentially a real-time action game versus a glorified FMV sequence where theres a set pattern for everything, its definitely a bit disappointing. That is made up for to some degree by having really awesome sound effects play when you do land shots with the rhythm of the on-screen display, as the trumpets blaring makes each attack seem that much more devastating.Closing Comments:", "date": "February 3, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
