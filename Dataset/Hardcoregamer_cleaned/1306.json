{"name": "Moco Moco Friends", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=177584", "text": "Catch em all has gone from a phrase to a genre over the last two decades, what with countless games taking inspiration from  and sometimes blatantly cloning  the Pokmon series. A game can take aspects of another, draw influence from those before it, or even pay homage in clever ways if it wants to appeal to a certain audience. A not-so-quality game, however, pulls from those before it without ever developing its own ideas. Naturally, there are plenty of games that exist between the two polarities and thats where Moco Moco Friends resides: between something that is effectively reminiscent of, and takes great pride in mimicking, Pokmon, and something that is too familiar for its own good.Moco Moco Friends is a lighthearted adventure starring our aptly dubbed heroine, Moco  a recently graduated witch who has the power to command adorable, but equally violent creatures named plushkins. Moco is a bit of what one would expect from a whimsical JRPG that doesnt take itself too seriously: shes a bit naive and bumbling, but determined and perseverant. Her goal is to, of course, be the best witch the world has seen, and to do this, she seeks an item called the Stella Medal. Those looking for an involved, or even just a good, narrative wont find a lot here; Moco Moco Friends story is sparse and uninteresting for the most part. There are a few characters that get introduced along the way that are worth investing in  such as a talking cat staff  but theyre fairly few and far between. Moco herself isnt all that compelling a protagonist either. She lacks personality overall, but that which is there is often ugh-inducing with her tendency to fit the usual female hero trope. Even outside of the core characters, though, the plot isnt interesting at its core, and when it actually is there and doing something, it doesnt do, well, anything. It all too frequently feels either too shallow or like its merely spinning its wheels.Gameplay is more Moco Mocos focus. As alluded to, the mechanics are eerily similar to Pokemon. Some games can get away with this, or find ways to iterate on the formula in inventive ways (see Yo-Kai Watch, for example), this however does not do a lot of that. As mentioned, Plushkins are the creatures befriended in this creature collect-a-thon. They are explained to be cute but violent  a fairly accurate tagline in that these beasts look like titular plushies, but also are used to fight and tear each other apart in combat. Battling has some depth to it, a relief considering how basic many other features of the game are. The formula for all of this is fundamental: delve a dungeon, fight a bunch of baddies, go back to the one and only hub town, sometimes get some story segments  other times (read: most of the time) dont  then rinse and repeat. The dungeons themselves arent all that fascinating from a design standpoint, nor are they all that varied or aesthetically-interesting, but they serve their purpose well enough; which is simply to act as an arena for combat, the sole attraction here.Combat is turn-based as one might expect. Just like Pokemon, creatures have element types and possess sets of skills that can be learned and are then employed to topple foes. Thus, the real alluring part to the battling is of course trying to match the right Pokemon to the given situation. That, and of course, finding new Plushkins to recruit is the name of the game. There are 120 creatures to hunt down and make part of ones team, all of which have really great designs. They sometimes look a bit more dopey (but in a really charming way) than those seen in Pokemon, which have veered on the side of oddly deformed as the series has gotten older over the last twenty years. On the whole, though, their designs are really superb and are easily the strongest part of Moco Mocos offerings. In fact, character designs at large are excellent, all appearing cheery thanks to a bubbly aesthetic and bright colored attire.Frustratingly, those designs arent brought into the game via impressive graphical fidelity. Characters are especially jaggey and blurry; to make matters worse, there just arent enough of characters (outside of the Plushkins) to see. Monster assets are re-used too often, the aforesaid labyrinths lack any kind of character or discerning quality and the visual flair burns out quickly with only one hub town. The sound, too, is well done. The soundtrack never supersedes a cut above average, but those tracks that are at the top of its bragging list are bouncy and fun. Like the visual presentation, though, there just arent a whole lot of actual songs to be heard and what is there can feel too same-y. Where the presentation does excel is in its localization. The prose, grammar and editing aspects have been handled with care.Closing Comments:Generic is the word that best sums up Moco Moco Friends. It all feels like a been there, done that game. Better said, it feels like a Pokmon clone for only the sake of being a Pokmon clone. It never wants to be more than that. Its almost like its developers couldnt be bothered with making it anything more than that. What it mimics from Nintendos grand franchise is a collect-em-all feature and turn-based combat that is satisfying, if not particularly deep. The problem with all of this is that there are merely better games doing what Moco Moco Friends does. Nothing is inherently broken here, its just that the game lacks an identity of its own. The only ones that should give this a look are those who have exhausted all of the other games of this genre and are still clamoring for another traditional monster-gathering RPG.", "date": "November 16, 2015", "grade": 3.0}
