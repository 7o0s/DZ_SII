{"name": "Rpublique  Episode 2: Metamorphosis", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=85067", "text": "Rpubliques security camera conceit opens up interesting gameplay opportunities, but it also allows for some novel storytelling techniques. Episode 2 opens moments after the tense cliffhanger at the end of the last episode, with Mireille Prideaux lying unconscious on the floor and Hope pounding at the door to the dissection room. Checking the interrogation tape shows a traitorous Prizrak guard telling Hope that whats going on is a lot bigger than her, and that hell be back to get her, before locking her in the room. Of course, Hope still has her phone, which means she has you, and in short order you get the door open and shes back on her way to the Librarians office.Where the first episode mainly concerned itself with establishing the games oppressive setting, Metamorphosis is more focused on its key players. We learn much more about the mysterious Overseers (or Headmaster, as he prefers to be called) past, the origins of his insane philosophy, and the ways in which he fosters his cult of personality. The librarian, a former Spanish national, draws some less than subtle comparisons between him and Francisco Franco (with whom he is pictured shaking hands). We also hear a few snippets of his interactions with Hope, which take on some very creepy undertones, especially when you hear his speech on why Nabokovs Lolita should be banned. In a nice touch, all images of the Overseer  statues and photos included  are pixelated on-camera. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes indeed.The librarian too is given quite a bit of development, which is good because its more or less clear from the outset that he wont be appearing much in future episodes. Hes something of a mentor to Hope, along with another pre-cal student named Weep. He seems to be particularly interested in introducing them to old, banned literature, as indicated by a rather touching letter from Hope that you find in his study. The other staff of Metamorphosis dont seem to get on well with him, though its worth noting that the Overseer seems to respect him enough to let him voice dissent  to a point. Hes not nearly as radical in his objections as the lates Zager, whos revealed to be a journalist who snuck in from outside the surveillance state.The young Weep is sympathetic to Zagers cause, which stands in nice contrast to Hopes more basic desire to simply see what the outside is like. The pair engage in typical teenage shenanigans, like sneaking smokes from the librarians private stash, but its clear Weep is more ready to play the part of the rebel. You find notes and guard emails around the facility that indicate hes on the run, which might be part of what spurred Hope to attempt escape herself. It feels a little wrong to be poking into the lives of these kids, but its fascinating at the same time. You feel like a big brother to Hope in both senses of the term, and the game asks where you draw the line between protecting and educating her.The gameplay in Metmorphosis is largely unchanged from Exordium, which means all the praise and criticism I leveled at the first episode holds true here. There are a few improvements to the game dynamics, though, which go a long way toward making the game feel smoother and more tense. Hope has access to a full 3D map of the facility now, which aids in the metroidvania-style exploration and makes it much easier to figure out where you have to go. Actually getting there, though, is more of a challenge thanks to the new ARC Prizrak  special enemies with randomized patrol patterns who arent affected by Hopes Tasers. They add interesting wrinkles to constructed stealth challenges, and prevent backtracking from feeling boring or repetitive. Youre given a few more abilities to help you deal with guards  like predicting their patrol routes or activating distractions  but they dont change much.There are also a few new puzzles to be solved, though theyre more of a mixed bag. The first one sees you exploring the Overseers personal museum in search of answers to the security questions that protect his password. Its an inventive blend of environmental storytelling and gameplay, and I hope we see more ideas like that as the game progresses. On the other hand, the next puzzle is a mind-numbingly tedious exercise that has you pushing buttons in a specific order. It wouldnt be so bad, but you have to do it while avoiding the gaze of a patrolling Prizrak, which makes for excruciating wait times in between button presses. Its more of an annoying diversion than anything else. The last puzzle is really cool, but I wont spoil it for you  even if the developers sort of do that themselves with their obnoxious collectible game cartridges.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 14, 2014", "grade": 4.5}
