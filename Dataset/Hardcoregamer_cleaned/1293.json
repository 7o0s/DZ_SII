{"name": "Knee Deep, Act 2: Festival", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=178797", "text": "Back in July, a new episodic adventure game hit the scene. Knee Deep, Act 1: Wonderland arrived basically out of nowhere and lured in unexpecting gamers such as myself. Developed and published by Prologue Games, it shared a distinctive style rather than cribbing off the popular modern adventure framework of Telltales titles. Act 1: Wonderland introduced folks to a tiny town in Florida where the apparent suicide of a famous actor named Tag Kern had just taken place. As is common for small towns, this sudden surprising event brought reports of all sorts out of the woodwork. This included a popular tabloid blogger, a local newspaper reporter and a private eye writing up reports on the incident. As with most episodic games, Knee Deep, Act 2: Festival picks right up where the previous episode left off. As such, youre not going to want to read this review if youve not already played the first episode. After all, the basis for the events of this chapter weigh heavily on the big reveal at the very end of Act 1: Wonderland. It is worth noting that its not even possible to buy each game separately at the moment. In order to experience the story you simply must buy Knee Deep  Season Ticket on Steam. As new episodes are released, theyre simply added onto your copy and accessible via the main menu. Weirdly, youve got to click on the new game option and then navigate to a new episode. Its honestly a bit confusing considering theres also a continue button that seems like a better candidate to jump into new episodes. Knee Deep, Act 1: Wonderland ended with a huge reveal. As the dead body was being examined in the morgue, it was discovered that the man was not actually Tag Kern  he just looked incredibly similar to the star. This mysterious twist has been hanging over the heads of players for months now. Though we certainly arent about to get a complete explanation (or any) in Act 2: Festival, were definitely given a taste of even more dramatic twists and turns. It appears that Prologue Games are also getting better at pacing. Whereas there were some serious moments of dryness in the first episode, it seems that players are finally getting to the meat of the tale here. Now it feels that every moment is both an important stepping stone to furthering the storyline as well as more interesting to watch unfold.This chapter is framed primarily around our three protagonists as each is questioned by police investigators to get to the bottom of the most recent death at the end of Act 1: Wonderland (if you somehow forgot, its when the cult member falls from the tower in spectacular fashion). Although we saw the events unfold through Romanas eyes, it appears that the police believe something completely different occured. It might also be possible that what we saw wasnt actually real. Who can say? Knee Deep seems to be planting the seeds for multiple potential storylines so that the final, true reveal will shock players. With that said, the shocking moments that do occur in this chapter dont feel all that surprising. This is compounded by the silliness of the crowd gasp sound effects which accompany these moments. Yes, I know, the whole thematic element for this game is that its a big stage play, but theres still something a little overbearingly campy about it. It might be because its been a while since Act 1: Wonderland, but Act 2: Festival also happens to feel a lot more controlled, leaving less room for players to do much of anything beyond watch. To be fair, you never could actually directly control any character. The gameplay for Knee Deep is incredibly simplistic and friendly for many types of gamers. Your primary control is choosing dialogue options for characters to say. There are also a multitude of minigames which task players with mostly simple goals. Unlike the introduction which featured a fair amount of both, here theres far less room for players to exercise their choices or skill. Hey, at least theres yet another huge twist at the end again to keep folks hungry for more.In many ways it simply feels like this is the result of having less time to put Act 2: Festival together. I have no clue if this was the case, but the episode feels incredibly truncated at just an hour and a half long. Sure, thats about the length of the first one, but with less time to actually interact with the game, everything feels like it speeds right on by. Those darn minigames, what few there are, have also begun to feel more tiresome than enjoyable. None are quite as frustrating as the final wire puzzle in Act 1: Wonderland, but the ones displayed here adds very little to the action. One early puzzle revolves around a simple game of copy the pattern while another has you piecing together fingerprints in the least exciting fashion possible. With such dull sequences, it might honestly be better to have them removed outright. Luckily, the visuals were not hampered in any way with this latest release. Just as before, theyre incredibly stylish with cool noir coloration and excellent framing. The coolest upgrade for Act 2: Festival is that it now features full voice acting. Now every strange member of the town, as well as our main trio, are voiced effectively. Its a bit jarring at first to hear the protagonists speak after creating my own mental voice for them, but they definitely grow on you. The developers even went so far as to retroactively add voice acting to Act 1: Wonderland for folks who are just stumbling upon this game now. Closing Comments:Its hard to call Knee Deep, Act 2: Festival either a success or failure; it does well in some respects while others fall flat. The best part of the series is still the tale of three folks who have gotten caught up in small town suicide/murder insanity. The visuals and play-like presentation also stand as neat additions, but it feels like this chapter whips by far too quickly to actually enthusiastically enjoy it. With even fewer points at which to interact, it also feels more film-like than game-like which may not please some folks. If you played and enjoyed Knee Deep, Act 1: Wonderland then theres little doubt you will also dig this latest release. Just dont expect to learn much more about the whole situation before this episode wraps up.", "date": "November 23, 2015", "grade": 3.5}
