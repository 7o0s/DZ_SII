{"name": "Moebius: Empire Rising", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=81910", "text": "Stiff and unnatural; those descriptors come up a lot when discussing the animation in 3D point and clicks, but until now, Ive never seen a game embody them in its every aspect. From its title to its art direction, all the way down to the building blocks of its code, Jane Jensens Moebius: Empire Rising by Jane Jensen is perhaps the most awkward point and click in recent memory (which is saying something considering the competition). As a writer, Im positively thrilled to be able to sum it up in a single pithy phrase. As a gamer, Im less than ecstaticMoebius stars Malachi Rector, an antiques dealer who is clearly a vampire. Obviously, the name is a giveaway, but hes thin and gaunt, reflections dont seem to work right around him, and you could put your eye out on his shoulders. At one point he very expertly threatens a womans neck with a knife. The biggest tell is that he moves like a reanimated corpse doing a substandard mime of a real person. Some might argue that hes a ghost because he can phase through a number of objects in his ineptly pre-rendered surroundings, but I chalk this up to his mist form.Malachi is, at all times, a wholly unlikeable asshole, whining about everything around him and condescending to everyone he meets. He seems to be going for the whole Im so smart Im beyond reproach Sherlock Holmes bit (right down to the constant drug use), but whereas Holmes and derivatives like Dr. House have redeeming qualities, Malachi is just a complete dick. Rent a substandard room for him? Youll hear about it. Dare to have bad fashion sense in his presence? Prepare to go home crying. This is understandable, however, because he must be starving.Every last human in Malachis world seems to have been replaced by an unconvincing doppelganger not unlike the pod people from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The difference is that these are more plant-like, looking as though theyre made of wood with all the features painted on. Since their veins are coursing with chlorophyll rather than the lifeblood that sustains our undead protagonist, he acts like a jerk to spite them. This is the only conceivable explanationOh sure, you could dismiss them as just being terrible character models, but what gives them away is their faces. They all have a dead-eyed, thousand-mile stare, they blink using their lower eyelids instead of the upper ones, and they cant seem to open their teeth beyond an inch apart. They give the overall impression of a mutant nutcracker. These freakish abominations cant even talk right. The problem isnt so much that the lips dont move in time with the words (although they dont), but rather that the entire face spasms along with them. Its as though the effort of mimicking human speech causes them immense physical pain. Sometimes, in the middle of a particularly difficult sentence, their entire body will freeze up into a t-pose for a few seconds. I suspect this may be the key to stopping them.Obviously, this vampire/body snatching plot is of my own invention (and Im accepting script options, Hollywood). Coming up with it was quite a bit more entertaining than playing Moebius, though thats not to disparage the games plot. Its quite an intricate thriller that blends historical facts with topical, modern-day issues, and the core premise could easily be built into a sprawling franchise like Assassins Creed. Jane Jensen is very talented at world-building and writing lore  the success of Gabriel Knight is a testament to that. Unfortunately, she cant write scenarios or characters worth a damn.The games cast doesnt help matters. Malachi doesnt so much encounter characters as broad, lazy, somewhat offensive stereotypes. He outsmarts a sleazy conman in an Egyptian bar (who cheats at darts, of course), catches a vain heiress cheating on her husband with the pompous butler, and uses his hot bodyguard to distract a stuffy, sex-starved librarian. Im not exaggerating, those are literally the descriptions puked out by the games psychological profiling mechanic (more on that in a bit). With content this generic, you barely have to put any effort into writing or acting. Amazingly, the game still manages to fail on both counts.Almost every exchange is peppered with awkward expository details. Even when the dialogue begins to approach something a human being might actually say, the awful scene blocking tanks it. At one point, Malachi shoos his assistant out of a conversation and closes the door behind her. Three lines later, he opens it back up and tells the man hes speaking with to go talk to her. In one puzzle, Malachi picks up a wine glass and carries it over to the hostess of a party. In another puzzle at the same party, he casually tucks a slice of chocolate cake, plate and all, into his jacket pocket. Moebius is littered with these sorts of inane inconsistencies.On top of all this, Moebius might well be the single worst-built adventure game Ive ever played. Im not talking about the puzzle design, per se  its boring and forgettable, but at least its not frustrating or offensive (except for the part where you seduce a woman and then threaten her with a knife). Rather, its the very funamentals that the game gets wrong. Every menu in the game, from options to inventory, takes more clicks to navigate than it needs to. When you start the game, the credits play, and then youre dumped to an entirely separate intermission menu where you have to click another button actually play the game.The game does everything wrong when it comes to item management and interaction. To access your inventory, you have to click on your active item at the side of the screen. This only allows you to change which item is active, though. To combine, examine, or look at (yes, those apparently needed to be different actions) you need to click icons at the side of the menu first. This commitment to inconvenience carries over into the core gameplay in the form of a verb coin. Weve stopped using these for a reason. Unless your game has some kind of unique mechanic, all of its interactions can more or less be boiled down to some variation of use/talk and examine, which can be conveniently bound to the two mouse buttons. If the designers had just used a normal drag and drop inventory menu, all of this hassle could have been eliminated.Of course, that would still leave all the other hassles in the game flow. Malachi stubbornly refuses to pick up items unless he can see a use for them, which more or less means backtracking across several screens whenever you encounter a new puzzle. Every. Single. Time. It almost descends into self-parody when he has to excuse himself from a visit for a few minutes and fly to another state and back because he didnt bring booze for the hostess. When you add in the time it takes to walk between objects, the six second load screens, the molasses-slow animations for every interaction, and the three second pause Malachi takes before doing anything, its utterly interminable. Oddly, the game does let you teleport (but only when walking) by double-clicking on the ground, which ought to be a genre-standard feature. Its one of the games two good design decisions.The other good decision is the profiling mechanic, which lets Malachi analyze both antiques and people based on various physical aspects. Its a cool way to emulate the deductive reasoning in things like Sherlock, and the one interesting wrinkle in an otherwise substandard game. Unfortunately, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The characters you profile just arent all that interesting (though there are a lot of fascinating historical details mixed in), and there isnt much game in the game mechanic. There are no hints as to how many data points youve picked correctly, so if the answers arent obvious (or your choices are too similar) it devolves into a frustrating guessing game.Closing Comments:", "date": "April 19, 2014", "grade": 1.5}
