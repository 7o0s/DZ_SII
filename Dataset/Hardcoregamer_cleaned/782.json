{"name": "Driveclub VR (PSVR)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=231030", "text": "The original Driveclub was released amid a sea of controversy two years ago and completely killed its ability to gain traction. Fans who were excited about it were left with a great game  but a sour taste in their mouths while those wanting a chance to try it via the PS+ Edition had to wait far longer than expected. Driveclub still delivered a top-shelf racing game, though, and one of the best photography modes of any game alongside some of the best graphics ever seen in a racer. The foundation was clearly there for something more and Driveclub VR is here to breathe a bit more life into the franchise.Driveclub VR is a natural evolution for the series, which had an incredible first-person view anyway, and VR makes for a fairly 1:1 transition for racing games. Theres no wondering about how things will be in VR because you know it will be a first-person perspective and for a genre that already has that, its an easy mental transition. Actually playing the game offers up for more excitement in VR than one can anticipate going in. In the heat of the action, you get a far better view of where your rivals are in relation to you and you will get sucked into the scenery far more than you would expect. In a way, maybe it shouldnt be such a surprise. After all, the original game was a stunner and put a lot of detail in the little things. Gauges in your car could be easily read and you could see far into the distance. Now, you can do all that while looking around in real-time and it will lead to a few crashes. Im not ashamed to admit that I lost my first few races just because I wanted to stop and stare at the water as the sun hit it  or just take a look and see as far as I could into the distance. Once that led to one too many losses, I decided to get serious and kick some ass in the game  and then everything truly clicked into place.As someone who normally isnt into a first-person view in racing games, this game provided me with the first experience where I felt like I could easily see where not only my enemies were in relation to me, but also the environment. Sure, there were still a few nicked corners  but my performances got better and better and didnt take long to do so. Going from last place, to fifth, to first in only a few races felt fantastic and will lead to me trying out more first-person racing experiences. The key is to see just how many of them can truly compare to what Driveclub VR offers. The environments are stunning and the thrilling crashes are far more visceral than before. Normally, an in-game crash is a huge deal in its own right now. When you factor in what is almost sensory deprivation into it where youre actually in this world with the outside world blocked off, however, it leads to more of a reaction. You feel the crashes more if youre in them and hear the metal crunch even louder. If youre near an accident, you have to react with split-second timing because you now that hitting the crushed car is going to render you SOL and possibly force a restart. This makes you race slightly more cautiously when things are crowded, and that is generally going to improve your overall play. Closing Comments:Driveclub VR is an outstanding showcase for PlayStation VR. As the lone racing game available for it, it stands atop a short mountain  but its core foundation being so well-crafted bodes well for it working as a showpiece for quite some time. Anyone who loved the original game should check it out, while those who always wondered what was so good about it will find out in the best way possible by experiencing it in VR.", "date": "October 17, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
