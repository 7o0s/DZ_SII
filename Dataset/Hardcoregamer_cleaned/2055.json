{"name": "The Wolf Among Us: Episode 5", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=94442", "text": "As this review covers the last episode of a long series, its more or less unavoidable that the following text will be spoiler-laden. If youre still not sure whether The Wolf Among Us is worth purchasing, then yes, it absolutely is. Whether youre a fan of narrative games in general or the Fables universe in particular, this is one title you cant afford to miss.For all their fantastic huff (and puff) and bluster, Fables arcs have a tendency to end on decidedly mundane notes. Power shuffles around, people cope with loss, and eternal life goes on. Such is the case with the final chapter of the Wolf Among Us, which opens on a tense standoff between Fabletowns Sheriff and its most vicious mob boss, and ends with a quiet goodbye between friends  or, depending on your choices, a less quiet one between enemies. At the end of In Sheeps Clothing, we finally met the insidious Crooked Man. In Cry Wolf we find that, true to his name, he is a twisted man in both mind and body. At first, he tries to win Bigby over with fine words and gifts. Then he offers the wolf a scapegoat for the brutal murders that started this whole mess. It was pimp Georgie Porgie who beheaded Faith and Lilly, but it takes just one look at the snivelling coward to know hed never make that move without The Crooked Mans go-ahead.When talks inevitably break down, the villain declares he doesnt care much for negotiation anyway. Why negotiate when you can just decide? Bloody Mary steps out of a mirror, the goons bear down on Bigby, and in short order all hell breaks loose. The wolf is unleashed  though how far hell go is ultimately up to you.This is the climax The Wolf Among Us has been building up to, and boy, does it ever pay off. Scene after action packed scene flashes by, each more intense than the last. Along the way, every loose thread of the mystery is tied up: the nature of the curse that kept the Pudding and Pie girls quiet, the reason Faith and Lilly ended up dead in the first place, and who it was that left Faiths head on the woodland steps. Each villain gets a satisfying conclusion to their respective arc, with the exception of the Jersey Devil and the Tweedles. Georgie and Vivian serve penance for the harm theyve done to their girls, though you ultimately get to decide whether theyve atoned with the truth. In a pulse-pounding battle, Bloody Mary shows herself to be a formidable destructive force  and is subsequently blown away by the force of nature that is Bigbys true form. For fans of the comics, its a treat to see the full fury of the Big Bad Wolf unleashed.Instead of fighting you, The Crooked Man tries to twist himself out of trouble. Bigby can choose to end it then and there, or drag him back to Fabletown to stand trial. In front of the Witching Well, the denizens of Fabletown conduct a tribunal to determine his guilt in the murders, and in corrupting their community with his criminal conduct. He tries to turn every one of your indiscretions against you and sway the people in his favour  Telltale games love confronting you with your worst choices, after all. Depending on the path youve taken through the game, youre given a few options for how to deal with the crook, though naturally none of them will leave everyone satisfied. We also get some closure with some of the games supporting cast. Mr. Toad and his son are shipped off to The Farm, along with Colin depending on your decisions. TJs final farewell to the woodlands and Snow White prove that Melissa Hutchinson can tug at your heartstrings in just about any child role, warts and all. Lastly, Bigby has words with Narissa, who thanks him for all that hes done for the girls of the Pudding and Pie. There are hints that she might have history with the Wolf, and the games final decision regarding her is interesting, especially given Bigbys current standing with Snow in the comics.Theres clearly a wide variety of ways this last chapter can shake out, and the decisions youve made over the course of your investigation can drastically alter the potential outcomes. Telltale has made good on their promise of a dynamic, branching narrative, and the various outcomes promise to have knock-on effects in future episodes. If I have to guess, Id wager that the next season will focus on the denizens of The Farm, and Bigbys behaviour toward Mr. Toad and Colin in particular will shape the course of his future adventures. Of course, thats assuming that the next season doesnt cast us as a different Fable  perhaps one whos actually allowed on The Farm.Closing Comments:", "date": "July 16, 2014", "grade": 4.5}
