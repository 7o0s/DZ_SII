{"name": "Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=264066", "text": "It was nearly seven years ago that Square Enix released an MMO of disastrous proportions. While they were able to create a fantastic experience in the form of Final Fantasy XI, they somehow missed the mark by about a mile with XIV, a game that cost the company an exorbitant amount of money and didnt know what it was doing. Its a miracle that the Japanese publisher was able to salvage the situation, not only reworking the entire system for A Realm Reborn, but creating some of the best MMO content on the market. Then in 2015, Heavensward came out to critical acclaim for venturing outside of the box and telling a more neatly written tale, one that felt grittier and down to earth. Cut to 2017 where the Final Fantasy XIV fanbase is only expanding and the second major expansion, Stormblood, is finally upon us and its a doozy. With new trials, dungeons, areas, level caps and so much more, tied in with a reworked job system, Stormblood has the potential do to great things for Final Fantasy XIV as a whole.Story is undoubtedly an important aspect to Final Fantasy XIV as, while it ties in many references to past games (not to mention taking a lot from Game of Thrones), it has its own uniquely designed plot that has its ups and downs. A Realm Reborn could be a slog to get through that even now we wish was cleaned up of all the trivial filler quests and dull scenarios. Heavensward itself spiced things up, telling a more personal, isolated and political tale that didnt really have much to relate to the Scions. Right off the bat, one of the biggest frustrations with the plot of Stormblood is Square Enixs unrelenting refusal to let anyone go from the story. While were not here to spoil anything, there are characters who are in critical condition, and some are meant for death, but that is never the case. Even now, the reminder of the final story mission prior to Heavensward lingers over the story where theres a certain emotional attachment to characters that feels stripped away because you know theyll be fine no matter what. The stakes feel artificial, especially considering the allies you do lose in the story mean little to you because they are introduced and are barely fleshed out. Theres even one moment in the campaign where a member of your team is captured randomly off screen that triggers what feels like an artificially forced attempt of a rescue and excuse to progress the liberation of Ala Mhiga. Outside of that, though, the plot itself is a still strong. While its more of an uplifting tale of liberation and freedom, it lacks grit and the political nature Heavensward established perfectly. Fortunately, there are tons of likable individuals spread throughout the plot of Stormblood, with a ruthless and compelling antagonist thats hard to rival. If anything, he needed more screen time as every moment he appears, you knew something exciting was going to take place. But regardless, there are some fantastic new areas youll be able to traverse, namely an entirely new continent of the world.With that, the biggest disappointment with Stormblood, by far, is the lack of Kugane content. For those who dont know, Kugane is the big new central hub that Square Enix has been promoting so heavily with its appealing Eastern aesthetic. The city itself is fantastic as its condensed into one central area, instead of being broken up into multiple district, so its easy to navigate as everything is roughly within walking distance from one another, and when its not, the crystals allow players to jump across the map. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of quests here, with the vast majority of the game taking place outside of Kugane. As much as we enjoy Rhalgrs Reach, Kugane should have played a more significant factor.Kugane isnt the only disappointment, though, as swimming is a wholeheartedly underutilized feature. While Heavensward introduced flying, Stormblood added swimming, and unfortunately its barely used. Theres one area in the game (The Ruby Sea) where theres a few missions that require you to swim around, but as soon as you leave this one location, it basically disappears from the expansion (outside of one immensely small moment near the end of the story). Fortunately, Spear Fishing has been added, which is a nice variation of your typical fishing abilities, just underwater and with a new off-hand weapon. It will most likely play a role in at least one beast tribes quests, but as of this extensive expansion, its nothing short of underwhelming. Easily one of the brightest and most entertaining portions of Final Fantasy XIV are the trials. These serve as multi-staged boss fights that, especially in end-game content, relies on a team to be properly coordinated. There are three in Stormblood and each one is not only unique in their own right, but exhilarating. The first is Susano, and it starts off like a typical boss fight where players will be dodging AOEs and stacking on specific allies. Its only halfway through when things really kickoff as youll feel your heart racing at the sheer excitement of the events. Its definitely a good first Trial for Stormblood, even though its not the most difficult fight. The second is much further into the story and is closer to the final Trial than it is Susano. The goddess to the Ananta, a new upcoming beast tribe, relies heavily on the new mechanic of popping quest-specific abilities on the fly. Outside of this mechanic, though, the fight isnt all that memorable with the exception of the fantastic music playing in the background. These two fights are great on their own, but if you try and face their Extreme versions, theres even more fun to be had (or frustration) as they add new layers of mechanics that will find most with a wiped party in no time.Finally, the big baddy of Stormblood sends things off with a bang as this multi-arena boss is no joke. If your team isnt on point and dont know what theyre doing, youre going to have a difficult time as this relies heavily on teamwork, much more than the others Normal versions. While the other two Trials are relatively straight forward, this will challenge any partys abilities and skill. The only real problem with these Trials is really the formulaic layout of how the story ties them in. Its always two Primals that are worshiped by a Beast Tribe and then one final boss. While the phrase If it aint broke, dont fix it, comes to mind, it still would have been a nice to see the writers think outside of the box. The dungeons in Stormblood are hit or miss, with a couple of stages hitting some absolute highs, but quite a few hitting sinking low. For starters, the final story-related dungeon completely falls apart, not only being laughably easy but just boring. The first boss is a throwback to one of the best Final Fantasy games ever conceived, but outside of that its a letdown. Doma Castle has a very similar problem, despite having a much nicer Eastern aesthetic. Fortunately, the first three dungeons happen to be very memorable, with The Siresong Sea being a fantastic opener to Stormblood. The best dungeon of the bunch is most likely Bardams Mettle, as one of the bosses forces you to play a series of mini-games to beat it, instead of engaging in your typical Tank and Spank engagement. As for the post-game dungeons at launch, they arent anything to get excited over. The Temple of the Fist has a final boss thats a healers nightmare, and Kugane Castle just has a fun, and familiar final boss. Really, its the first three dungeons of Stormblood that left an impression on us, with the rest being passable adventures.Similar to Heavensward, Stormblood features a couple of new jobs. On paper, you may be disappointed that theres only two this time around, but its more quality over quantity in this case. Red Mage is a personal favorite as its primarily a distance fighter, with some abilities that bring the rapier-wielding character in close for some devastating blows. While theres no new healer this time around, the Red Mage acts as a hybrid, not only being having strong magical attacks, but having some healing, as well. Having an extra buffer for curing allies is incredibly handy, especially if a healer dies in a dungeon or trial. No longer is it a wipe situation as the Red Mage can now resurrect them. Next is the Samurai, who is more of a typical DPS class who fights with style. He shares similar traits and gear with the Monk class, and it shows as Samurai focuses primarily on self-buffs than anything else. Like any job, its all about rotation, but Samurai is all about stacking abilities on top of one another in order to perform specific attacks and deal out high levels of damage. We can definitely see his appeal, but he holds nothing to the Red Mage in terms of versatility. Overall, both classes offer vastly different DPS capabilities, and while it seems strange to avoid Tanks and Healers, two classes that only have three offered jobs (compared to nine DPS jobs), it will certainly help fill up the 24-man raids. Closing Comments:Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood is an exceptional expansion that unfortunately refuses to take any risks. Were not talking purely about the progression of dungeons, trials and leveling, but Square Enixs unwillingness to try anything new or audacious with the story. They also refuse to commit on specific plot elements, turning Stormblood more into a fan service anime rather than a deep and meaningful adventure. It doesnt help that both the city of Kugane and the swimming mechanics both feel underutilized, especially considering how much of a highlight they were leading up to the expansions release. I may sound like Im beating on Stormblood quite a bit, because there are a few missteps, but in reality, this is a fantastic expansion that introduces some meaningful changes to jobs and helps establish an unknown part of the world. The primal fights are memorable, both new jobs are entertaining to play as, there are plenty of new and refreshing characters, and the story can be uplifting at times. This is aided by one of the best antagonists the game has seen in a long time. It may not be as revolutionary of a step as Heavensward was to A Realm Reborn, but Stormblood is still a fantastic entry that will have players hooked for countless hours.", "date": "July 3, 2017", "grade": 4.0}
