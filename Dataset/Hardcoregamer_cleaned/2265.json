{"name": "The Last of Us: Left Behind", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=74509", "text": "The Last of Us was without a doubt one of the best games of 2013, and its got numerous Game of The Year selections to prove it. Naughty Dog is certainly no stranger to Game of the Year awards, but one thing they arent familiar with is single player, story driven downloadable content. All of the DLC for the Uncharted games consisted of multiplayer add-ons such as maps, character skins, or cooperative scenarios, and the DLC thus far for The Last of Us has all been multiplayer related. The Last of Us: Left Behind was announced during the launch event for the Playstation 4, and likely stands to be Naughty Dogs last single player production on the Playstation 3, which is obviously a system they have produced many fantastic games for.When it was initially announced, Left Behind was presented as being the story of how Ellie initially became infected, and you may be surprised to learn that is only half true. Left Behind is actually framed in two distinct locations and time periods, switching between the two as the story progresses. It begins during winter, just after Joel was injured, and basically aims to show how Ellie saved Joels life and got the two of them from the college campus to the mountain village. Not long in, the game cuts back to Boston prior to the start of the main game and gives us a glimpse of Ellies life in the quarantine zone. Its here we are introduced to Riley, Ellie best friend, and taken with the two on an excursion to a mall.These two stories have nothing to do with each other, but there is a thematic through line that provides some interesting context to Ellies actions to save Joel and her attitude for much of the main game. The framing seems a bit odd at first, but as things progress it becomes more understandable, and the spots they chose to jump back and forth feel absolutely perfect. With that said, the Boston sequences are much more interesting from a story standpoint, with the winter sequences serving much more of a gameplay function than a story one. The story that does present itself during the winter parts unfortunately doesnt tell us anything we really needed to know. Sure, it clarifies details that were missed when story jumped from autumn to winter in the main game, but theres nothing revelatory here. The Boston sequences, on the other hand, seem much more essential, and more importantly feel distinct from any any moments in the main game.There is no combat during the prequel portions of the DLC, but there is certainly gameplay. Left Behind features several new mechanics, the majority of which are used once and never returned to. A minor complaint many had about the core game was the re-use of some mechanics such as palette puzzles and moving ladders, so the variety of mechanics employed over this fairly short bit of content is very welcome. Its not just the variety of mechanics, but the fact that they all serve to give substance to and further establish the relationship between Ellie and Riley. Due to a perfect combination of outstanding dialogue, top notch voice and motion performances, and smart implementation of player input, the relationship between these two characters feels believable and genuine, and is really the highlight of this DLC. You really get the feeling these two know each other better than anyone, and they truly come across as best friends.If youve played the main game, and remember some specific dialogue in particular, you know exactly how this story ends, but that works in its favor. Compared to the main game, the tone of Left Behind is much lighter for the majority of the story. You may actually find yourself smiling, something that didnt typically happen during The Last of Us, and much of it consists simply of two friends enjoying each others company and having a good time. Youd think knowing that it goes bad would diminish this, but instead you want it to last as long possible. You know things are going to go just about as bad they could, so you revel in their happiness while they have it. Of course, thats only half of the DLC, and the switch back to Ellies solo struggles in winter serve as a harsh reminder of whats in store for her, and that this night is likely the last opportunity shell have to just be a kid and have fun.While the Boston half of Left Behind consists of very little of what would be classified as standard Last of Us gameplay, the winter portion is basically nothing but that. While the core of what defines the gameplay hasnt been drastically changed, there are certainly some improvements, the biggest of which is the addition of combat encounters that involve both hunters and infected. The lack of these types of encounters was one of the very obvious missed opportunities of the main game, and honestly its somewhat surprising to them finally implemented here. For what must have been a very difficult AI challenge, one wouldnt expect this feature to miss the main game but make it into DLC, but the addition is welcome regardless. These encounters give you many more options in how you approach combat, and taking advantage of the situation as the two groups fight each other is very satisfying.The winter segment of Left Behind is an interesting evolution on the core gameplay loop of The Last of Us, but this whole portion of the DLC comes off feeling non-essential. Pretty much all of the story takes place in the other time period, with Ellie never even talking to anyone during winter. Its not as though winter is bad, it just sort of feels like it exists to make room for combat without breaking the story and to stretch out the running time on the DLC to a length that would sit better with players for the price. Its by no means unpleasant to play, with the high production quality, ridiculously detailed environments, and tense combat youd expect of The Last of Us, its just not as engaging as the other part of the DLC.
