{"name": "Metrico", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=96912", "text": "The PlayStation Vita is home to an eclectic collection of some of the most bizarre games available. From visual novels featuring robot bears to highly sexualized collectible card games, there is plenty for even the weirdest gamers to enjoy. The Vita is the go-to console for the quirky, the unorthodox, and the straight up odd. Independent developer Digital Dreams has somehow managed to out-weird essentially every game in the Vita library with Metrico, one of the most creative games the industry has seen all year. There are times where Metricos innovation will break your brain and blow you away, but unfortunately its best elements are often overshadowed by a number of downright obtuse mechanics. This is what can happen when creativity goes too far.Metrico takes place in a highly-stylized 2-D world filled with charts, graphs, variables, and constants. Players take the role of either a male or female single-colored human who remains silent throughout the roughly five hour campaign. Every action tends to have some sort of consequence that affects the world. Perhaps moving left will raise a platform, while moving right will lower it. Jumping might build a bridge across a previously massive gap, allowing for easy advancement. Respawning at one of the various circular retry points might completely eliminate one section of the area. Every action matters, making Metrico feel removed from any previous puzzle-platformer. The jumping mechanics lie somewhere between floaty and tight, but thats not whats important here. Sure, Metrico is a puzzle-platformer, but its heavy level of environmental manipulation essentially takes platforming skill out of the equation. This is much more of a game of mental gymnastics than physical dexterity, as precision never truly has to be worried about. Instead, the focus is placed heavily on experimentation, a key staple of the best puzzle games. Every inch of every area could have a game-changing effect, so players need to fool around in order to progress. Puzzle-solving tools are constantly inserted into the equation as the game progresses, meaning that the level of experimentation constantly increases.These puzzles start out brilliantly, as they are entirely based upon character movement. Using a combination of running, jumping, and even dying, players have to maneuver a number of platforms to get to the next side of the screen. Every action during the first section uses the D-Pad and the X button, so its easy to get immersed in the action. The gameplay is subtle, allowing Metricos outstanding electronic soundtrack to permeate the fibers of ones mind. Its worth mentioning that Digital Dreams suggests that Metrico be played with headphones plugged in, as immersion is the name of the game here. While the mesmerizing visuals, atmospheric soundtrack and unique puzzle design starts out wonderfully, it quickly turns into an obtuse monster the likes of which weve never seen. Metricos second world introduces a shooting mechanic and various spinning enemies, upping the difficulty slightly. Not only does one have to worry about his or her positional movement, but a handful of new variables as well. Platforms may react to the number of shots fired, number of enemies killed or not killed, amount of times each enemy is hit, and whether or not shots hit certain platforms. The puzzles begin getting stranger here, as players will find themselves getting stuck at various points. The key to advancing in Metrico is to try every learned mechanic until stuff begins to happen. Unfortunately, the shooting mechanics require maneuvering ones finger around the rear touchpad to aim. This is an insanely curious choice, especially considering that the right joystick is never used for anything in Metrico. This mechanic slightly breaks the immersion Metrico so desperately tries to create, since players have to willfully consider where their fingers are at all times. Enough games use the right joystick to where gamers can use it intuitively, never having to think about where they are aiming. The number of games that require players to accurately maneuver their digits across the Vitas rear touchpad is far far lower, as one would expect. Aiming this way is mildly obnoxious, but its actually acceptable compared to some of of Metricos more ridiculous control mechanics.Once motion controls and the Vitas camera come into the equation, Metrico enters dangerous territory. You see, just because a mechanic is creative and innovative does not mean it makes for good gameplay. Metrico manages to completely shatter any sense of immersion it hopes to create the second it requires you to platform upside down. Thats not a typo, Metrico will occasionally require you to play completely upside down. Remember how the game asks you to plug in headphones immediately? Try being fully immersed when a cord is dangling back and forth in front of the screen. Playing with an upside down Vita is childs play compared to the puzzles that force you to spin your handheld in circles while paying attention to your characters position. The worst mechanic of all? Putting your Vitas camera up to a light source and tilting it to manipulate how the light hits it. Certain platforms may only move if your Vita is positioned a certain way in relation to the rooms light. This is essentially one step away from having to toss your Vita in the air repeatedly as if its a baby enjoying a fine game of Rocketship. Metrico consistently dances back and forth between amazing and migraine-inducing. Some of the games best moments come between worlds, as players have to solve a door puzzle to advance to the next area. These puzzles make use of a number of the games mechanics, including some of its most annoying, but their use of online functionality is fantastic. After a player enters one of the doors on the screen, a pie chart appears detailing what he or she chose compared to his or her peers. These door puzzles are some of the most immersive moments in the entire game; theres no explanation, story, or reasoning for why they exist. Its simply fascinating to see whether ones choice is the most or least popular for the sake of curiosity.There are some occasional framerate issues that, again, break the immersion Digital Dreams tried to create. When the framerate slows to a crawl between individual stages, it calls into question whether or not the structure should be different. Constantly moving from left to right makes everything feel unified, but these stuttering moments break up Metricos flow. If structured like Thomas Was Alone, for instance, it might run more consistently. Mike Bithells narrative-heavy, shape-centric platformer treated every stage as its own unique area, but still managed to group them together in chapters. It could be played in short bursts or straight through and the message remained the same. A short black screen between each stage in Metrico would have been more visually appealing than the stuttering drops that consistently pop up throughout the campaign.Closing Comments:", "date": "August 5, 2014", "grade": 3.5}
