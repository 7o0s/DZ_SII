{"name": "Ragnarok Odyssey: ACE", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=80445", "text": "When Ragnarok Odyssey was released back in October of 2012, it was met with mostly favorable reviews. Of particular note were its customization options, accessible hack and slash gameplay and overall graphical fidelity (which allows it to rank in at the top of the Vitas most aesthetically-pleasing titles, by the way). But, here we are, some 18 months later and we are getting an updated version of RO under the moniker Ragnarok Odyssey: ACE. As an enhancement package, its sometimes hard to find relevancy when the original, base game from which the complete version is built, is still fairly fresh in the minds of gamers. Thus, were ultimately left with a simple question: how exactly does ACE stack up against its source title?From a gameplay standpoint, the core mechanics here have carried over from the original Ragnarok Odyssey. In fact, in this department, everything remains unchanged. After all, this is simply an enhancement of content, not a shakeup in design principles. As such, ACE plays smoothly, combining a wonderful pace with action-RPG systems that feel rewarding and challenging simultaneously. Its a system that is akin to others in its genres  titles such as Phantasy Star Online/Universe and Monster Hunter immediately come to mind. Although, we should note that ACE is not nearly as deep as those games, but the fundamental action goes down in virtually the same way. To that end, ACE feels like more of the same, really, especially for those who played the first installment. So while on one hand thats a glowing endorsement, on the other it means we get a game that is riddled with bugs and glitches that have somehow not been addressed in this expansion title.In terms of the positive, though, RO:A delivers on what worked so well in the original entry. That means the six character classes are back and feel generally well-balanced. Better still is the fact that each plays independently enough from the others to feel exclusively unique in terms of playstyle. This ultimately equates to an experience that is diverse, at least to the point of extending replayability by a good number of hours, since mastering the classes will take some time. And then of course, theres the combo system that is very much so worth discussing, as its one that has enough variety to keep the enemy juggling aplenty, making sure that folks can hack and slash their way through aerial combinations and entrancing change-ups that look dazzling to the eye.Naturally, for folks who played the first game, they can transfer over certain basic physical features (such as name, face and job classs  but not clothing) as well as some of their items to ACE. Unfortunately, however, not everything will carry over, but the game does at least allow Monster Cards and Weapon Cards to be imported as well. Sadly, jumping right into the campaign isnt as easy as we had hoped, since returning players will have to start the campaign over from the very beginning, which is something sure to make some people groan with disappointment. Speaking of the campaign, nothing has been added to the titles core story  know that now. In fact, all the new content that ACE brings to the table is post-game stuff. The biggest enhancement is the new narrative that revolves around the Tower of Yggdrasil. After completing the last chapter of the campaign, players are informed that a massive hole has sprung up in front of the mythological Nordic tree, Yggdrasil. Once learning of this information, players are whisked off to the tree and are asked to delve the humongous dungeon in search of answers as to why this turn of events is happening in the first place. Regrettably, the narrative surrounding the enormous tree is less than interesting on the whole, with text block upon text block of flavorless dialogue delivering the key story points. But even so, and just like the base game, RO:A is more focused on dishing out an adrenaline-pumping gameplay experience than a quality, character-driven drama.Speaking of Yggdrasil, its worth talking about what exactly it offers in terms of content. After purchasing Yggdrasil Drops from an NPC in town, players are granted access to the trees sprawling innards. Once inside, folks will have the opportunity to battle their way all the way to the top, which in this case is a couple hundred floors. Sounds massive, right? Well, it is, though, its not nearly as exciting as it should be. With reused enemies and assets, and a host of new bosses that simply dont have the same amount of personality and challenge as those of the original, Yggdrasil itself sometimes feels like a chore to play. Sure, its a great way to grind and put to use the rock-solid gameplay mechanics, but trouncing the same baddies over and over again can only sustain ones attention for so long. Thankfully, the trees randomly generated trials, dubbed Ordeals of the Valkyries are a nice break from the inevitable combat repetitiveness, as they are specific challenges that reward players with higher-tier loot, attribute improvements and various other enhancements. All in all, the largest chunk of new content in ACE ultimately feels like a bit of a mixed bag.But theres more to RO:A than this massive labyrinth. Players can now utilize the new ACE Skill system, which is an arsenal of powerful new moves that can be unlocked when enemies drop Proof of Expertise items. These special attacks are, if nothing else, fantastic to watch as they are usually enormous in scope and damage; better still is the fact that each feels so strong that using one is both a fairly rewarding and empowering experience. The ACE Skill isnt exactly a game-changing mechanic in and of itself, but its a nice addition, and one that adds another layer of depth to combat engine. The final addition to ACEs new content is the inclusion of a dozen AI mercenaries to take into combat. Folks who prefer to go at things alone, without the company of others in a multiplayer setting, can now recruit any two NPC mercenaries to fight alongside them. AI mercenaries are available for hire in various classes and in both genders, so players can pick and choose companions that offset or support their own character. Its a fun feature, really, and one that ensures a complete experience for those unwilling to take the fight online.Speaking of online, the multiplayer in ACE feels even better than it did in the first title. Because of the incorporation of ACE skills, classes seem more balanced overall, making each player feel equally valuable in the group, which merely serves to enhance the quality of group combat situations in general. Sadly, we experienced more than a few bouts of lag in our time online, though the experience was mostly a smooth one. Still, the intermittent lag spikes certainly could put a damper on the fun.Its worth mentioning that the visual fidelity of Ragnarok Odyssey: ACE truly depends on which system players are using to play the game. Since its launched on both PS3 and Vita, it will be up to each person to decide which is the best setup for them, however, we will say that graphics were generally slicker and more impressive on the Vita. While the game at large felt and controlled better on PlayStation 3, the aesthetics simply lacked any kind of merit there; textures were ugly and the low poly count for character models was abundantly more noticeable on the big screen. Still, both games performed practically the exact same, which is wonderful considering the games framerate rarely dipped, if ever. And much like Rangarok Odysseys soundtrack, the OST in ACE is hit and miss, with some tunes truly standing out as triumphant favorites, while others disappeared into the background, unable to really capture our attention due to lackluster arrangements.
