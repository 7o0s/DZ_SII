Its a game far too many missed upon its initial release on Wii back in 2012, and an adventure absolutely worth experiencing. With Shulk back in the spotlight thanks to Super Smash Bros. on Wii U and 3DS, Nintendo has given Xenoblade Chronicles another shot at the success it deserves. And, just as it was on Wii, its the utter definition of a system-seller.The world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is made entirely of water, save for the bodies of two titans frozen in time. Its on these dueling figures that all life exists, organic on the Bionis and mechanical on the Mechonis respectively, and like their titanic homes the opposing life forms are locked in an ageless struggle. Equipped with the mysterious Monado, an ancient blade said to have been wielded by the Bionis itself, Shulk journeys all over the ancient hulking frames with his companions in seek of revenge against the Mechon menace. Its a captivating premise, and one that only becomes more intriguing and impressive as the story unfolds.The world really is the star of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D. Its hard not to be awed by the enormous halls, vast landscapes and incredible variety throughout the game, an effect bolstered by the fascinating lore of the Bionis and Mechonis. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D tells a story of war, loss, love and friendship, and while it may indulge in a few tropes  an orphaned boy with an all-powerful weapon  it largely treads fresh narrative ground on its way to the JRPG hall of fame. Its just a shame the visuals cant live up to its incredible premise, or equally marvelous soundtrack.Despite muted colors, fuzzy textures and jagged edges, however, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D manages to retain most of the beauty and grandeur that defined its original form on Wii. The art direction, architecture and enemy designs all still look incredible, a testament to the design and detail at the core of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D  a confident, unique and inspired take on the tired JRPG. Its not a perfect port, though. There were a few occasions when the notably brilliant soundtrack and voice acting cut out completely, replaced with ugly intermittent screeches and distorted audio. There is also significant slowdown when too many enemies appear on screen at once and occasionally while running through particularly impressive environments, but those instances came and went before they could affect the experience. For the most part Xenoblade Chronicles 3D runs beautifully on New 3DS, an impressive display of the systems boosted processing power.In fact, the adventure is actually perfectly suited for handheld consumption. The luxury of saving at any time means its easy to hop in for quick sessions, and it also implements the New 3DSs additional inputs, particularly the C-stick, to wonderful effect. The systems flaunted stereoscopic 3D, however, goes largely unnoticed, merely adding a hint of depth to the odd cutscene or enemy encounter. The handhelds touchscreen capabilities are also completely ignored, instead relying solely on traditional inputs and leaving most of the of the lower screens real estate bare. Those design decisions dont remove anything from the experience, but they do rob players of the ingenuity and polish of Nintendos other recent 3DS ports. On the bright side, Nintendo added a jukebox and model viewer to the title, a gesture sure to be welcomed by returning fans, but hardly generous.Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a long game, clocking in at over 60 hours, but unlike so many other JRPGs it never feels bloated or drawn out. Its pacing is near-perfect, shaving off the tedium so common in the genre; frequent fast-travel landmarks and simple quest completion means theres hardly any instance of forced backtracking, and by doling out experience after battles, quests and even discovering new areas, theres rarely a need to grind. These simple changes to the traditional JRPG formula make for a much more pleasant and accessible experience, rendering enjoyment of its incredible story substantially easier.Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is supremely supportive of wandering off the beaten path as well, however. It actively encourages, inspires and rewards exploration, always prepared to serve up another side quest or secret area, and thanks to the refreshing experience system and perpetually breathtaking world, seeing whats on the other side of that hill never feels like a waste of time. Theres a fantastic sense of scale to the adventure; standing on the thigh of the Bionis and seeing its leg sprawl down into the ocean below, then looking up to see the sword of the Mechonis extend into the distance is positively breathtaking, and those periodic doses of perspective really help emphasize how far youve come on your journey.The combat is incredible too, turning confidently away from the turn-based standards of the genre and adopting an action-based format more akin to an MMO. Its a complicated tango of action, angles and forward thinking, and while it can be a bit much to digest at first its a deeply engaging system once youve found your rhythm. Additional folds like premonitions of enemy attacks or significant new abilities are introduced periodically to maintain the excitement and challenge at the systems core, assuring the experience remains superb. Not only that, but the characters constantly fire off remarks, encouragement and all sorts of banter to each other throughout each fight, emphasizing their humanity and unique personalities.One of the most infuriating elements of JRPGs is often the implementation of random battles, but Xenoblade Chronicles 3D intelligently dodges that pitfall and manages to make its world leagues more immersive in the process. Hundreds of wondrous, menacing and beautiful creatures are seen throughout the journey roaming freely in their natural habitat. You can choose to keep a wide berth and pass by unscathed or charge head first into battle, and that distinction makes the entire experience feel substantially more organic. Each beast appears like a wild, natural resident of its territory instead of a trial devised to test skills and patience, making players feel like explorers as much as warriors.While battling enormous beasts and exploring the worlds almost infinite caves and crevices, its also important to monitor the relationships between the characters. Increasing their affinity reaps significant benefits in battle and character development, so theres plenty of reason to go out of the way to keep everyone happy. Its not a requirement, of course, but those looking to get the most out of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D will likely lose themselves in the deep and rewarding relationship system without a second thought. It also helps that each character is masterfully crafted in their own right, bringing uniquely compelling motivations, perspectives and humanity to the events of the game. Its simply one more level of complexity in the massive, ambitious cocktail of Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, an adventure that fires on all cylinders and manages to deliver at every turn.Closing Comments:Xenoblade Chronicles was an incredible experience on Wii and it has transitioned beautifully onto New 3DS. Some compression concessions were made in the process, but the underlying quality of the narrative, setting and mechanics ultimately mean the cosmetic blemishes make little difference. Once again cementing its status as a JRPG masterpiece, Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a game you owe it to yourself to experience.", "date": "April 10, 2015", "grade": 4.5}
