{"name": "Octodad: Dadliest Catch (PS4)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=82178", "text": "Note: Portions of this review appear in our PC review of the game.You wouldnt expect much of a freeware title built around a single terrible reality show pun, but the original Octodad proved itself to be a funny and slightly heartwarming little number. Following the games success at GDC, some of its student developers teamed up to form Young Horses Inc., and the newly-minted studio got to work on a bigger, better sequel. With more levels, a more involved story, and one more terrible reality TV pun in its title, Octodad: Dadliest Catch made waves when it hit Steam late last year. Our own Lee Cooper hand plenty to say about that version of the game, and I more or less agree with his assessment (though Id have scored it a little higher).The PS4 version is more or less the same game with slightly different controls, and while using a controller does make a bit of a difference, (easier to walk, harder to use your hand) its not enough to merit writing the same review twice. Instead, since this port is for Playstation, Id like to compare it to Sonys own awkward dad simulator, Heavy Rain. Because thats super topical these days. Which of the two is better, and why is it Octodad? Read on to find out.Octodad: Dadliest Catch is the strangest slice of gaming pie since Mister Mosquito. Youre a family man  I mean, mollusk  with a loving wife, and two semi-beautiful children. Although that in itself is a medical mystery best left to the Japanese and their research of tentacle erotica. You see, despite your nervous burbles, destructive tottering through the assorted environments, and whatever eventual assault you accidentally launch on some innocent bystanders, you mustnt break character. After all, thats the fundamental goal in Octodad; remain undetected while you perform your fatherly duties. Thankfully, the inhabitants of the town you live in are a chromosome away from wearing floaties in the shower, which makes being stealthy about as necessary as stilettos on ice.The minute-to-minute duties arent as easy, however. In theory, theyre the simplest tasks imaginable. Things like shopping for frozen pizza, mowing the lawn, flipping some burgers, exploring an aquarium with the family and walking litter the list. Nothing particularly daunting, right? In reality, however, as a gummy-creature of the ocean, these puzzles youre required to complete involve moving your limbs. And thats not something an octopus can easily do on land, it seems. Octodad isnt about meeting expectations, though. There are no groundbreaking gameplay mechanics at work, either. In the end, its all about dexterity.Its not surprising, then, that controlling that squishy sack of innards is tricky; especially when those wandering suction cups attach themselves to any inanimate object that crosses your path. One input controls one leg, while another controllers the next. Another button switches to your free arm, which can then be used to grab and move different objects in the environment. Its a seemingly simple control-scheme thats gloriously difficult to master, and occasionally an exercise in frustration. Octopussy-footing around a level can feel a lot like dragging a wet plastic bag full of marbles through a puddle of jelly, but its always hilarious to witness and incredibly fun  until youre tentacle is trapped in a crevice as you waddle helplessly.Nevertheless, thats not what makes Octodad the weird game that it is. Its inexplicable nature does, and the lack of an obvious genre helps, too. Its not quite challenging enough to be a puzzle game, with most stages demanding a task as simple as plugging a leak with a stuffed animal, or escorting your son through a jungle-gym of kelp and kelp related obstacles. As a platformer, it also fails due to its lack of an intuitive infrastructure, and exploration is usually rewarded with dissatisfaction. But thats not to say that Octodad isnt good. For that matter, it can be great; especially if youre a Laurel and Hardy fan, and part of that greatness is owed to its on-purpose awful controls which, for better or worse, will consume a majority of your time.On the contrary, the story is mostly insignificant. Theres a sushi-chef that can smell your true fishiness, and hes determined to put a stop to your charade  no matter what it takes. Your wife suspects something is amiss as well, and theres the whole youre an octopus business that comes naturally with such a premise. Its nothing mind-blowing, but it is a source of some hilarious moments, especially in the comments youll hear throughout the game. Oh, that family of yours and their silly, silly comments.The banter is possibly the most charming, amusing and often downright engaging part of Octodad, too. There are even some feels to be had here and there. One such instance has you struggling to wobble up a running escalator while your daughter  too scared to be alone  motivates you with some strangely endearing phrases. Shell also spout nonsense about monsters raising her if shes abandoned, and becoming a jellyfish that produces honey  normal little girl stuff. Regardless of how often the quips and phrases are reused, theyre almost always a joy to hear. While there are plenty of awkward slapstick gags, references and jokes across the short adventure, I found it was my family and their silliness that made the intermittent floppy levels worth drudging through.Closing Comments:", "date": "April 22, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
