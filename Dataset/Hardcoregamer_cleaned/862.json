{"name": "Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=225383", "text": "Once upon a time, licensed games were known to be utter garbage. Luckily weve moved beyond this era (for the most part) and now regularly enjoy games based off television shows, comic books and cartoons. The anime Psycho-Pass first aired in 2012 and drew its fair share of attention. Since then, the franchise has proliferated in all manner of ways  into a manga, novel adaptation and video game. In North America, Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness is available on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita (sorry, Xbox One owners!). Unlike most who will end up buying the game, I wasnt a fan of the anime beforehand. In fact, its a show that never even crossed my radar until the impending release of this visual novel rendition. As such, the perspective reflected in this review comes from someone who was not already aware of the concepts, characters and world of Psycho-Pass prior to playing.This perspective is actually worthwhile due to the fact that Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness does not simply retell the storyline from the anime. Instead players are introduced to some brand new protagonists in a tale which occurs basically in tandem with the show. These new characters include the two playable protagonists of Takuma Tsurugi and Kugatachi Nadeshiko. Tsurugi finds himself fueled by the disappearance of a childhood friend. As his search becomes more dire, he somehow finds himself in Tokyo enrolled as an Enforcer with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) As for Nadeshiko, her storyline begins in far fuzzier fashion. She has suffered almost complete memory loss as the result of a tremendous accident. Despite having basically no knowledge of her past, she immediately leaves the hospital once discharged and reports for her first day of Inspector work at the CID.Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness is the sort of sci-fi tale that takes a 1987 approach to the future. The Criminal Investigation Department isnt just a far-flung future version of the police. Instead, this group is closer to the FBI in that it has the power to monitor citizens in frightening ways. The most disconcerting of these insights is the Crime Coefficient. Somehow, science has managed to figure out what exactly makes people criminals. As such, each person is monitored from the moment of birth to death for their Coefficient. Rarely, someone may be predisposed to crime from the get go. Mainly, though, changes are triggered via mood which is monitored by a Hue meter. If someone becomes angry or depressed long term, their hue will eventually dip and become cloudy. These are warning signs to take action before someone becomes a criminal. Its on this dangerous teetering point that the CID gets called into action on a variety of cases.The incidents that the CID investigates are the antithesis of feel good storylines. Right from the very start players are presented with all manner of unpleasant and disturbing incidents to try and resolve. For example, one of the earliest chapters details infant abuse. What makes this all the worse is that players are given a powerful amount of control over how the investigation progresses and ends. Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness features a great deal of choices to make throughout a playthrough. In each chapter, youre typically provided multiple dialogue choices that directly decide what your team does next. Should they perform more research or intuit the criminals next move instead? How should you approach the scene, and who is on your team? Each choice feels weighty, especially with the lives of people in truly unfortunate circumstances on the line. Resolutions that feel like failures are taken as an acceptable course of action, which hammers home the effect of these stories on you. At first, having no knowledge of the Psycho-Pass universe provided an issue while playing. Although the game features its own glossary, the immense speed with which sci-fi terminology was thrown out became nearly overwhelming. The good thing is that this quickly subsides once newbies get a feel for the backdrop. Its certainly convenient that these themes of mental policing have been around for decades. Existing fans of the series should have no trouble jumping in and enjoying the new characters alongside concepts theyre already well versed with. In any case, the storytelling is such that you want to know more. Theres a strong urge to keep playing despite the depressing incidents consistently brought up. This is thanks in part to an excellent translation and a storyline that never lets up.Folks who come into Psycho-Pass from the anime may be at least a little let down by the visual presentation. Yes, it has some awesome anime-style sprites, but theres hardly any animation to speak of. It would have been exciting (and impressive) to have the game more closely mimic its anime version, but that probably wouldve made the game much larger. There is full Japanese voice acting included, at least. Visual novel fans, on the other hand, may ultimately be annoyed by the lack of features. Its impossible to set the text to progress automatically at a set speed when voiced lines occur, for one. Luckily, like most visual novels, it includes a tremendous wealth of save slots. These are imperative to have in case players wish to see how different choices play out in each case.There are no differences from a gameplay perspective between the PS4 and PS Vita edition. Thats not to say one version is not better than the other. When it comes down to it, there are a few things to keep in mind when choosing your version. The PS Vita release is handy, but all text feels quite small. This is when compared to other visual novels on the handheld. Most is still readable, but the Hue meter might as well have a font size of two while the glossary is similarly tough to read. In comparison, text feels a lot more readable on PS4. Finally, there was no means at the time of this writing to sync saves between both versions so dont get excited about playing the game both at home and on the go with ease.Closing Comments:Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness brings an established franchise into the visual novel world successfully. The storyline and characters are utterly compelling, regardless of your awareness of the source material. In fact, the story was effective enough to convince me to give the show a watch. The game does, however, end up missing a few of the convenience features expected from many other modern entrants in the genre. It also feels that the lack of text resizing done for the Vita leaves this version feeling a little iffy at times. Still, theres nothing that beats the feeling of actually affecting a narrative in serious ways. Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness provides a successful entry into an awesome series as well as a new storyline for existing fans to consume.", "date": "September 10, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
