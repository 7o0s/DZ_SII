{"name": "Mega Man Legacy Collection (3DS)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=194792", "text": "The existence of Mega Man Legacy Collection has been incredibly ironic. Despite whatever Capcom claims sparked the release of the title, its clear it was meant as a way to take the wind out of Mighty No. 9s sails, the unofficial spiritual successor from series creator, Keiji Inafune. After all, some might find it hard to purchase an untested Mega Man mimicry when they could have the original six games for only fifteen dollars. Hilariously, however, Capcom didnt even have to play spoiler as Comcept and Inti Creates did a fine job sabotaging themselves when the game was delayed from its original September 15 release date. Mega Man Legacy Collection still came out as scheduled on August 25 and faced little competition. Capcom clearly didnt want to let their fan siphoning plan go, however, so announced that the collection would be released physically on on February 23which just so happened to be around the time Mighty No. 9 was delayed to. Amazingly, however, Capcom again didnt have to bother as Mighty No. 9 was again delayed to an unspecified date. At this point, Capcom would be best served to just sit back and do nothing as Mighty No. 9 has clearly become the Jeb Bush of the video game world.Regardless, Mega Man Legacy Collection has now been released physically on PS4 and Xbox One and debuted for the first time on 3DS.Though there are numerous gamers out there that havent experienced the core Mega Man titles before, it seems silly to try and explain the premise of six games that are over two decades old. Sure, I could explain how every game has a series of robot masters that players have to defeat in any order (though theres always a couple of logical paths that have become accepted as the norm in each case), and defeating each one grants players powers that will make their lives easier over the course of future stages, but what fun would that be. If youve stumbled onto a review of a collection of Mega Man games, chances are you know what Mega Man is all about. Whats more important here is the value that potential consumers are getting for their dollar, as spending one-fourth the price of a full retail game gets you hours and hours of world-class gameplay and a number of awesome extras that make Mega Man Legacy Collection feel lovingly crafted. While Mega Man Legacy Collection largely comprises of straight ports of Mega Man 1-6, which many would argue are the premier games in the longstanding action-platforming franchise, this isnt necessarily a bad thing. Sure, it would have been nice for some of the slowdown that this series is known for was eliminated, as the Dark Master stages in Mega Man 3 are notorious for the sheer amount of framerate drops they feature, but some would argue that Mega Man wouldnt be Mega Man without this so-called flaw. After all, there are countless speed-runners that have utilized slowdown in their pursuit of time-based greatness, and to deny those who have played these games dozens of times the chance to run through six titles the way that they are accustomed to sort of feels wrong. The thing is, there isnt anything technically wrong with these ports, likely because theyve been shifted to other platforms for years now, so those looking to get a history lesson in the foundations of gaming will still find a great amount of joy here.The original Mega Man games are known for being notoriously difficult, and while there arent any options available for players that want to dial down the punishment, there is one notable inclusion that should make everyones lives easier. The inclusion of a manual save slot for each title in Mega Man Legacy Collection shows that Capcom didnt just want to fart these games onto a new generation of consoles. Password saves are very clearly a thing of the past, and while theyre present for those who want to have the true experience that gamers in the late eighties and early nineties had, those accustomed to modern save mechanics will feel satisfied. In case you were wondering, yes, this does mean that you can manipulate save files in order to progress through each game in a simpler manner (like so many people do with Virtual Console titles). The inclusion of a dedicated music player and a Museum of artwork for every game turns Mega Man Legacy Collection from mere compilation into the definitive place to go for your early Mega Man desires. Its my humble opinion that the background music for Magnet Mans stage in Mega Man 3 is one of the greatest video game songs, and the fact that this collection gives me the opportunity to listen to that track through my television while I make dinner inspires a level of joy thats pretty tough to put into words. Everyone has their favorite Mega Man song, and the fact that every single entry is included in one playlist is something truly special. While the concept artwork in the individual game Museums amount to little more than a enemy sketches and their names, this feature cannot be understated. Its abundantly clear that there are going to be younger players who will keep a walkthrough of every game at their side throughout their time with Mega Man Legacy Collection, and being able to see every enemy in one place will have a subtle, but meaningful effect on player strategy. Sure, this isnt a feature that the vast majority of people will actually care about, but its guaranteed that there will be gamers out there who will eat these Museums up. Consider the inclusion of concept artwork and sketches the cherry on top of a phenomenal package.Arguably the best part of Rare Replay was its Snapshot feature, in which players were given the chance to play through bite-sized challenges that featured a number of Rares early titles. These NES Remix-style gameplay snippets were absolutely wonderful, but Mega Man Legacy Collection finds a way to improve upon this feature in every conceivable way through its Challenge Mode. Capcom has come up with a number of challenge playlists that each comprise of a number of short segments from various Mega Man games (all grouped thematically). Everything from a Boss Rush playlist to some of the toughest parts of each individual title are included in Challenge Mode, and while those playlists that jump from game to game can be jarring, theyre all still a joy to play through. Yes, its confusing to choose abilities when you are looking through Mega Man 1-3s minimalist menus, and not immediately knowing whether you can slide or charge your Mega Buster will cause problems, but this is a small price to pay for an outstanding feature. Its worth noting that a vast majority of Mega Man Legacy Collections achievements are based upon Challenge Mode, so those looking to up their Trophy Level or Gamerscore will likely find themselves diving into these time-based, medal-awarding playlists.Mega Man Legacy Collection is largely the same on 3DS as it is on PS4, Xbox One and PC, which is just fine considering how successful it is on those consoles. By far the most exciting option comes way of the Collectors Edition which includes an exclusive gold Mega Man amiibo. The amiibo is not only easy on the eyes, but it also unlocks eleven fan made challenges in-game. The core games themselves play exactly as they do on consoles. Sadly no 3D is used (which although probably wouldnt have done much to enhance the experience, has been proven to be effective with classic games with SEGA) and the bottom screen simply displays key art from whichever of the six games is being playing. The museum has also been refreshed with some new art and history pieces which are nice to look at, but naturally dont add much to the experience. Unfortunately, the graphical filters found in the console version are missing here, but they wouldnt have done anything notable on such a small, low-res screen anyways. Closing Comments:Mega Man Legacy Collection is just as fulfilling on 3DS as it is on consoles and PC. Theres nothing new of note added (amiibo support) or removed (graphical filters) to make any serious difference. The biggest downside to the release is the fact that it has an MSRP of $29.99 (or $49.99 for the Collectors Edition) when last years digital version was a mere $14.99. It does include four stickers and a digital soundtrack sampler, but that combined with the case and cart do not make for $15 of added value. Still, classic collections like this are great on handheld consoles as they can easily be played when multitasking, in short spurts during lulls or for hours when stuck on a plane. Those who already own the release on consoles have no reason to double dip unless they want to play it on the go, but for those who prefer the portable experience, Mega Man Legacy Collection is a winner on 3DS.", "date": "February 24, 2016", "grade": 4.5}
