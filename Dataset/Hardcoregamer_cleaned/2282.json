{"name": "Consortium", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=72460", "text": "When you talk about the defining aspects of a role playing game, the common topics are things like a level up system, loot, or stat based combat. One thing that is often missing from role playing games is the ability to actually play the role of a character however you desire. Sure, there are plenty of RPGs that allow you to really role play, but for the most part the genre has come to be defined by level ups and loot more than true role playing. Consortium is an indie role playing game that focuses squarely on narrative, giving you a role in story with the ability to affect the way things unfold. The first installment in a planned trilogy, Consortium is a game with grand ambition on a limited budget, and that ambition shines through at every turn.The year is 2042, or is it 2014? The core premise is that a tech company has developed a satellite with the ability to communicate with an alternate reality that is 28 years ahead of our own. Not only can we peer into this futuristic parallel Earth, but we can use this satellite to inhabit individuals on the other side and alter the course of events. For all intents and purposes, you play as yourself, because the creators of the satellite have chosen to implement the technology to control individuals in the parallel universe into a commercial video game. This means the game acknowledges that you are controlling a character by playing a video game, and it uses this unique premise to great effect.Things begin with you logging into the satellite, and from that point forward everything takes place in the parallel universe. You control a member of The Consortium, a privately funded peacekeeping organization with cutting edge technology and a chain of command based upon chess pieces. Pawns are basic operatives, Rooks are experts in a specific discipline and oversee the Pawns, Knights are the highest ranking field operatives with authority over a single team, and the King and Queen lead the entire Consortium. You play as a Bishop, who are elite combat operatives that are each assigned to a team of Pawns, Rooks, and a Knight. The entire game takes place on a Consortium airship called Zenlil on a mission over Bulgaria, and the events that unfold are heavily shaped by your choices and actions.Being a game with a limited budget and modest scope, Consortium is only about 4 or so hours long, but the small scope allows for a large degree of variation over how things play out. The core mechanic of the game is a dialogue system, and its pulled off quite well. Every time your character is given an opportunity to speak, you get a minimum of two options, usually more, and you always have the option to say nothing. Whats great about the dialogue system is that you have a lot of control over how you engage with the other characters. You can choose one of the options available to you, choose to say nothing, or simply walk away from the conversation. You are never forced to do anything, and the game keeps moving forward no matter what you do. The dialogue really stands out due to the nature of the choices you are given, and you can shape how the crew of Zenlil see Bishop Six in a number of different ways. There are dialogue choices that a Bishop in this world might say, but also choices that a 2014 video game player might say. Whether you stay in character or choose to reveal your true nature to the other characters will shape how they react to you, how much they trust you, and how certain events play out.The first half of the game is mostly getting acclimated to the ship, getting to know your crew mates, and getting up to speed on the situation at hand. Things move slowly here, but how you interact with your crew mates will determine the course of events later in the game. Each character has an affinity rating towards you, and your words and actions have the potential to either negatively or positively change this rating. Though much of the game consists mostly of conversing with your fellow Consortium officers, it remains engaging due in large part to the excellent writing and solid voice acting. Every character has a unique voice and personality, and getting to know each of them is engrossing throughout. The way they respond evolves as their affinity towards you rises or falls, and overall there is a lot subtlety in how your actions change things in addition to the large story turns you can influence.Around the middle of the game some major events transpire, which is one of the few sequences in the game with the possibility of combat. Its entirely possible to talk through this scenario, though its not a situation where you simply pick a good or bad dialogue choice to choose talking or fighting, but a subtle result based upon your approach in several preceding conversations. If you do find yourself getting into combat, youll find the weakest aspect of the game. The combat plays like a first person shooter, but its not very engaging. The weapon handling isnt great and their isnt much visual feedback on enemies. Compounding the lackluster combat is an inventory system that isnt self explanatory and feels needlessly complex. Instead of using weight or inventory slots, the game using a confusing energy system which makes dealing with weapons, ammo, and items more of a hassle than it should be.After about the halfway point, the Knight tasks you with solving the murder of a member of the crew. This part of the game evokes classic murder mysteries, ticking every box on the checklist to create a compelling mystery. The large cast of characters, any of whom could be the killer, are all trapped in an enclosed space (the ship) with no possibility of escape, and your character as the outsider is tasked with uncovering the truth. Several characters have motive, many have secrets, almost all of them have opportunity, and a shockingly large number of them have no solid alibi. This leads to some fascinating dialogue, but what makes this so interesting is that, unlike most games that task you with solving a murder, you can completely fail to do so. When the credits roll, its entirely possible, and in fact likely that you were unable to identify the murderer, with the consequences set to pay off in the next game in the series.The biggest disappointment about Consortium is the way it ends, largely because it concludes at a point that feels like the game is just getting started. The story doesnt come to a major conclusion but instead begins a set up for what appears to be the next sequence in the game but is actually the set up for the next game in the planned trilogy. Its especially disappointing because the story is incredibly compelling, and youll desperately want to see it continue. The short length is certainly mitigated to a fair degree by the variability of the story. You can easily play the game a second or third time and have things play out different enough to make the experience feel quite distinct. Youre still going to hit the same broad strokes, but the way events play out and the arc of specific characters will be quite different if you take a different approach to the game.Despite its many strong points, Consortium is not without its rough edges; the presentation is hit and miss. As mentioned previously, the voice acting is solid, but the visuals leave something to be desired. Its got a fairly strong art style, but theres no getting around the lack of detail in the visuals. The game also has its share of technical issues. There was a very recent patch that appears to have cleared some of these up, but prior to it we encountered several crashes and scripting issues that prevented some side quests from being completable. The final element of the presentation, the music, is very good. The music was done by renowned video game composer Jeremy Soule, and its up to his usual high standards.Closing Comments:", "date": "February 2, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
