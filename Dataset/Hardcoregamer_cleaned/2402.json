{"name": "Pokmon X and Y", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=61289", "text": "I know what youre thinking, Why did it take so long to write a review? But I have a legitimate excuse: I was too busy playing Pokmon. Now, youre like, Okay, that makes sense. Im off the hook now. Pokmon X and Y are so huge I needed nearly a month to experience everything. As a fan of the series since Pokmon Red and Blue I couldnt just blow through it all without catching them all and paying close attention to detail and we wanted to experience every facet of Pokmon and let our lives be saturated with it before giving a proper review. Let me begin by saying this is the best Pokmon game Ive played in all my years. The 3D modeling really gave the series much needed depth and after years of routinely traveling through a pixelated land, this update came at the right time. Pokmon has spent five generations using the same graphics and mechanics. There have been advancements, yes, but with the 3DS we can see all our favorite pocket monsters in surprising new angles. Since the main draw of the franchise are the creatures, it was necessary to enhance interaction between trainers and their Pokmon.Each trainer is different. There are some who grind nonstop for the right stats and others just want to have the cutest party possible. Many have bonds with their Pokmon that are stronger than relationships with real people. Thats not a bad thing, theyll just become a better Pokmon Master than you. The Pokmon-Amie feature allows you to interact with your Pokmon like never before. In Pokmon HeartGold and SoulSilver you were allowed to walk with any of your Pokmon and even talk to them, just like you could in Pokmon Yellow with your Pikachu, but Pokmon-Amie lets you pet, feed and play with them. Not only is it fun and cute (watch what happens to Durant if you poke it too much, so cute), but there are benefits to having a strong relationship. The more you play games, pet their faces and feed them Pok Puffs, the more advantage you gain during battles. As your Pokmons affection grows you can land critical hits, hang on with 1 hit point left, find items after battles and get cute little comments saying how much of a connection the two of you have. These events can occur during any battle as long as its not against another player, so AI opponents better watch out. You can pet your Pyroar during battle to let her know shes doing such a good job, yes she is. If youre the type of trainer who works on powering up your Pokmons stats to form the toughest team, theres also the Super Training mini game. Pick one of your Pokmon to shoot soccer balls at a gigantic balloon in order to level up your stats. And you can knock around a punching bag for your stats to increase. If you add this on top of EV training against wild Pokmon your stats will exceed the average and you could increase it even more with other modifiers. Its not as interactive as Pokmon-Amie, but its just as helpful.Pokmon X and Y knows how to keep the game going. Everything happens at a quick pace. Leveling up Fennekin to a Delphox occurs in no time. You can turn on the Experience Share which gives experience points to all the Pokmon in your party, even engaged in battle. The one who did most of the work received more points in past Pokmon games, but now each one of them gain the same amount. Many trainers made it up to the Elite Four in a matter of hours because its so simple to reach higher levels. Even saving your game data take a mere two seconds at most, literally. I have no idea how they did it, but they made one of the series most annoying aspects take up the least amount of time. Its amazing, now theres really no reason to have to wait in the car while your family is already inside the restaurant ordering their meal. Now, you can sit down while your Pokmon rest comfortably in the vehicle.Generation VI bridged a pretty wide gap when it came to connecting players with each other. Remember when Game Freak wanted you to trade and collect via link cable? When Pokmon first started online modes of play, its wi-fi settings were confusing and clunky. Since the 3DS comes with built-in internet connectivity, all you do is connect and youre able to battle, trade, send gifts and more with complete strangers. Anyone online can challenge you or initiate a trade. The Friend Safari is another reason to find more friends and register their Friend Code. Ive spent more time in the Friend Safari than anything else. Once you register someone, youll be able to enter their safari which is just a small grassy area with the chance to catch three Pokmon. Each person has their own type (mine is Rock), so youll find three different Rock-type Pokmon if you enter my safari. The reason why this is a fun place to be is its the complete opposite of past safari zones. You can battle the ones you run into, its a nice place to level up some of your weaker Pokmon. Youll find somewhat rare Pokmon, even starters and others you cant catch elsewhere. My favorite feature of the Friend Safari is the chance of finding a Pokmon with its Hidden Ability. In the last generation it was only obtainable through the Dream World, but now its much easier. Graphically, the game is unparalleled to its predecessors for obvious reasons and is the first to stray from its pixelated past. Movements are smooth and Pokmon are detailed down to the tiniest effect. Sableye cant stop twitching, Snorunt are always shivering, Kirlia move like ballerinas and Gulpin eat Pok Puffs in one bite. Its enjoyable and always surprising to see these monsters characteristics visible in-game. Their cries have been reworked as well. At first I didnt enjoy their voices being changed  its like changing history  but after listening to a few I realized how cuter and fitting many of them became. The old cries from the first games were just noises, now they actually sound like creatures. Attacks look better than ever. Pokmon actually move to attack like they should and some attacks take up entire cutscenes. The game looks and sounds great, its really a dynamic change. As good as the game is, there are a couple of crucial aspects holding it back. As many fans have been aware, there are not many Pokmon to choose from in this generation. Only 69 new creatures are available to choose from making this generation the smallest. New Pokmon are what the fans want and while the quality is there it doesnt make up for it. Mega Evolutions are a nice feature giving some old favorites more incentive, but why only pick a few? What made them choose that handful of Pokmon? Another reason this game isnt all there is its storyline. Pokmon Black and White had a much deeper story involving all the gym leaders, the professor, your friends  all kinds of people. In X and Y, you walk in to some towns and theres nothing happening and they have no idea whats happening elsewhere. The story it does tell is a bit clich someone wanting to destroy the world and you must stop them. It would play out like numerous cartoons and movies if no Pokmon were involved.Perhaps there was insufficient memory to incorporate as much as previous titles, who knows, but I feel strongly that Pokmon X and Y will be the franchises premiere game for a while. The 3DS allows the capability of downloadable content and has been virtually hack-proof. If Nintendo chooses to capitalize on DLC it will make discovering new Pokmon easier, allow for the storyline to expand and give us trainers more value even after catching them all.
