{"name": "Wolfenstein: The New Order", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=85619", "text": "The year is 1946, and the Fuhrer is dead. Theres no slowing down the Nazi regime from pushing through Allied forces, and despite one hell of a fight, theyre no match for the worlds most advanced technology. The Nazis are taking the war. Naturally, and in a typical 80s action flick manner, brick-wall hero B. J. Blazkowicz isnt in the business of bowing to the Third Reich, and decides to assault their base of operations despite impossible odds. Theres a turret involved, some bombastic progress and a handful of mini-victories, but enough shrapnel in the face will drive even the grittiest, manliest, most absolute Nazi-killin machine into a 14 year mental slumber. And so it did.From the very onset of Wolfenstein: The New Order, its clear that Blazkowicz is, without a semblance of doubt, a 90s video game character. Theres no painful recollection, insightful realization or character moment in which an emotional roller coaster rushes through the story. Theres only a grunt, and some grungy whispers about destroying Nazis. Once the prologue runs its course, things pick up in a mental institution. You need to escape, and thats essentially the long and short of your objective. Of course, walking out of detention unscathed is a breeze for a man whos coma hasnt deteriorated a sliver of his physical condition, and in a seemingly stronger than every fashion  and much like the classic titles of yesteryear would have it  theres no name taking as you reach the bits-and-pieces of resistance that remain in existence.With much of the game revolving around the killing of Nazis, developer MachineGames patched the road less traveled, offering various playstyles that can be employed without consequence. Each approach, while different enough from another to feel authentic to the experience, isnt restrictive in the least. Youre never penalized for teetering between options, and it mostly boils down to personal taste. Stealth, for example, will have you speed-crouching behind unsuspecting Nazis, tossing throwing knives and taking a back seat to much of the explosive action. On the other hand, the assault approach is appropriately hazardous, with plenty splodin body parts and dual wielded assault rifles to liven the mix.The shooting mechanics are, for better or worse, simple. Weapons have weight, sound unrealistically violent, and are as satisfying to shoot as they are to carry  and youll be carrying them all, as theres no loadout limitations in Wolfenstein. Mixing and matching is encouraged by enemy variety, which ranges from massive, hellish robots that demand a different  somewhat tactical  approach, to hordes of bullet-sponge Nazis whose meat falls from the bone like an SS chicken wing. While taking the stealthy approach is often the most attractive option  and also the one I opted for in most cases  its also the trickiest to commit to. I found that there were too few moments in which stealth was MachineGames intended form of play, and it was often wiser, faster and more enjoyable to kick a door down and blow Nazis into a bloody mist of guts and triumph with a rocket.Theres ample reason to stay focused and keep to your choice of guns, though. Perks, Wolfensteins primary source of character progression, are earned by completing objectives in any order of the various playstyles. These upgrades will permanently enhance Blazkowicz, improving things such as magazine capacity and headshot strength. You could, in your self-tailored experience, never amount a single perk without so much as noticing the difference, but the requirements are rarely more complex than kill so and so amount of so and so, making them both useful and easy to earn.Its clear that Wolfenstein isnt about dealing with Blazkowicz breakdown and subsequent struggle. Theres a grittier approach in its classic folds, and despite featuring many subtle  and less than so  mechanics of modern shooters, theres very much an oldschool, fist-shaped heart at its core, chock-full of health and armor kits, over-the-top action and a narrative that could easily accommodate the acting chops of Dolph Lundgren. Its not just its near-lack of a regenerative health system that keeps Wolfenstein from shaping into a Call of Duty clone, however. Its the story that, in the end, positions the game a slice above its adversaries.Where it succeeds beyond the basest point is in its execution of characters, particularly Blazkowicz himself, who offers no more depth than porta potty but somehow manages to shine as leading man. Humor peppers the script, and genuine moments of struggle keep the serious tone of a world ruled by Nazis in check. While most characters will slip in and out of the story, collapsing much of their weight on the outcome, theres a sense of placement that trounces much of the cheesiness, resulting in a game that does its lack of multiplayer proud, as its clear where extra time was invested.In its tradition of remaining true to form, Wolfenstein doesnt baby players, either. Despite taking place in a series of narrow hallways and closed arenas, theres occasionally a befuddling lack of direction. Indeed, theres always a reticle to follow, and theres always a place on the map which will shift the story forward, but its just as easy to get lost in its dark, bloody corridors, heightening the tension and leaving much of the exploration feeling at home with the horror genre. Likewise, theres a plethora of secret pathways and rooms, encouraging drifting from the course, and offering an overwhelming amount of collectibles that unlock various goodies on the main menu.Visually, Wolfenstein is dark and dreary. Its clear, from the banners and prison-like constructions that somethings not quite Reich with the world. Theres plenty of grey in the palette, and while the prettiness of it all is boasted admirably, much of it can look unrefined at times. There are other missed opportunities that hold Wolfenstein from true greatness, too. These issues become more apparent as you progress through the story, and while theres certainly nothing wrong with it on any fundamental level, much of the late games enjoyability is heavily determined by your love of shooters.At some point in the 15 or so hour campaign  somewhere between your first perk and some striking set pieces  the introduction of newness halts, and everything dwindles back to formula. Its then that, regardless of its best merits, Wolfenstein begins to feel like just another FPS. While the experience itself doesnt stale in most regards, it simply begins to pander, making its simplicity a slice more obvious. Thankfully, theres enough variety in both the sci-fi-esque aspects  riddled with robot dogs, space travel and moon-base operations  and the more grounded, shotgun to the head gameplay.But perhaps the most disappointing missed opportunity happens in the first act of the game, where youre offered a choice that seemingly determines the outcome of certain events. While its inclusion is appreciated, and the altered collectibles thatll appear throughout the game encourage replay, theres something cheap about its overall effect on the experience. Theres not much of a difference, and the only folks thatll willingly jump back in are diehard fans of the genre.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 20, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
