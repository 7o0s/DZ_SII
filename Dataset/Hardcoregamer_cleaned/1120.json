{"name": "Knee Deep, Act 3: Boomtown", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=196419", "text": "Episodic games usually come to us from Telltale Games these days. Of course, there are many indie developers out there who look to this style of release as well. One of the most ambitious indie episodic releases in recent memory has been Knee Deep by Prologue Games. Knee Deep, Act 1: Wonderland launched in July 2015, with Act 2: Festival following up in November. Again, with just about four months of development completed, theyve brought forth Act 3: Boomtown as the latest free DLC update. When Act 1 first launched, there was no way to know if the developers would ever complete their episodic plans. After all, we have more than enough examples of companies which close up shop after a single episode. Luckily we have now seen that the series was able to be followed through to its conclusion which means it is now time to discuss how well or poorly it all came together.Before we begin, please note that this review is focused toward folks who have already played Knee Deep up to this point. While it may help to point out gameplay features that newcomers should know about, there will also be very obvious spoilers from the previous two Acts. Given that this series is focused so heavily on storytelling, it would be a shame to learn about its various twists during a simple review. Those curious about this episodic story as a whole should probably instead check out my review of Knee Deep, Act 1: Wonderland instead. With all that said, lets dig into the whole immense cliffhanger that Act 2: Festival left players with. You might recall that at the very end of the previous episode that our trio of heroes (four if you count the dog  and you should) were in a fairly dire situation. Not only had basically all the bad guys revealed themselves, but K.C. Gaddis, Romana Teague, and Jack Bellet were all captured just as their investigation was heating up. How the heck could they get out of this situation? I admit to being quite concerned at the end of the previous Act. As it turns out, though, this dramatic conclusion just seemed to exist for the purposes of a good cliffhanger. I say this because the whole fear of what their entrapment means is basically extinguished immediately and in an incredibly eye-rolling way as well. Chances are youll either laugh or be seriously put off when the deus ex machina appears. Given my stance in the latter camp, it only provided an early annoyance with the narrative choice.Things just really seem to get out of hand in Cypress Knee in this concluding act. Even once our heroes make their ridiculous escape, they almost seem to fall into the background as previous background characters take center stage. Crazed gator-obsessed guy Jefferson Dean Gallant is suddenly propped up to a much more important role, as well as others who you may not even remember the names of. The thread of what sinister happenings were occurring with The Church of Us, the upcoming election, and Golden Cypress development all finally tie together as well. Sort of, anyway. The way that everything just suddenly reveals itself is a bit too fast to get a clear notion of whats going on with everyone, as well as their motivations. Then again, the characters in Knee Deep have always had a sort of single minded determination about them which fit in with the theater style presentation.The best part about Knee Deep, Act 3: Boomtown is the fact that all those choices made throughout the game appear to finally have an effect. Theres something weirdly exciting about seeing the notification that something terrible or awesome occurred because of your specific choices. With that said, I dont personally know what alternate routes exist but the choice results I received felt mostly fitting with the overarching storyline. It would be nice if there were an easier means to tweak past decisions in order to check out the differences between segments, though. Also, it is still super confusing to have to select New Game in order to continue off with your existing save into the next Act.Unfortunately, it seems that puzzles only got worse as Knee Deep trucked along. Maybe they ran out of ideas for fun mechanics? The two main puzzles in this chapter are absolutely useless in that they do not require the player to think at all. Instead, they act as artificial gatekeepers that take up a bit of time simply due to the process of interacting with them being slow. Perhaps this attempt to extend the gameplay length was due to the fact that this last chapter clocks in at just about an hour long. Sure, the series has never been particularly lengthy, but it just doesnt seem to make sense why these puzzles were even included otherwise. In any case, the rest of the tale manages to be strange and interesting enough to make you temporarily forget about these stumbling points. Voice overs continue to be a welcome addition to Knee Deep, though this time around they have a sort of echo-y quality. Or, at the very least, it sounds as though theyre talking in a completely empty room instead of whatever set the characters are shown within. Im not sure if this was an intentional design choice, but it comes across as a little bit cheap-sounding as a result. Visually, the series has always looked pretty cool with its sharp angles and strong color choices. There are some scenes in this Act specifically which make great use of the unique design style, but beyond that, theres really nothing new to remark about in the graphics department.Closing Comments:The question at the end of the day is whether or not this series was worth the time. All in all, Knee Deep clocks in at around four hours and showcases a strange Florida town filled with weirdos and secrets waiting to be uncovered. The secrets prove to be quite offbeat in keeping with the weirdness of everything else presented throughout. While the story kept my interest, it was not one that I would go out of my way to recommend to others. Those looking for backwoods-focused tales with a stylish presentation and weird circumstances/people would probably do better to play something along the lines of Kentucky Route Zero once its finally completed. Knee Deep is unique, but in the end fails to capture its potential into a truly memorable experience.", "date": "March 7, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
