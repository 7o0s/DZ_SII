{"name": "Lost Marbles", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=69738", "text": "When it comes to indie games, the puzzle platformer genre is extremely well represented. However, most indie puzzle platformers are 2D games with a typically retro art style. Lost Marbles is a rare indie puzzle platformer that takes place in a 3D space with polygonal visuals. The game is stated to be a cross between Marble Madness and The Lost Vikings, combining the marble based platforming of the former with the three character puzzle solving of the latter. While half of the developers stated inspiration is the arcade classic Marble Madness, the gameplay actually more closely resembles the game Marble Blast Ultra. Like Mable Blast Ultra, Lost Marbles is a 3D platformer that has you guiding marbles through increasingly difficult levels. Unlike Marble Blast however, Lost Marbles has puzzle elements in addition to the traversal obstacles.The first thing that will jump out at you as you begin playing is the way the game controls. If youve played Marble Blast or any of the Monkey Ball games, the physics are going to feel a bit wrong. In those other games the physics and handling feel how you would think a ball or marble would actually behave. However, in Lost Marbles the marbles dont maintain momentum the way you would expect and, aside from rolling down slopes, they behave more like a character in a third person game than actual spheres. Now, thats not to say the controls are at all bad, in fact once you stop expecting the marbles to behave like a ball would, you realize you have pinpoint control. You can stop on a dime and dont really have to worry about losing control. As you come to some of the tougher platforming sections, youll be glad the game isnt accurately modeling rolling physics, because those sections would be much more difficult if it did.The game has three different types of marbles, and begins with you controlling the rubber marble, which has the ability to jump. Not far into the game the paper marble and metal marble are added to the mix, and this is where the puzzle elements begin to present themselves. Aside from having slightly different handling models, each of the marbles also has unique properties and a special ability. Being the one capable of jumping, the rubber marble is mostly used for platforming but can also absorb electricity and float in water, though it will be destroyed by other types of hazards such as fire. The paper marble can shrink in size, but it is also the most vulnerable. It can be thrown about by wind and will be destroyed by every type of hazard. The metal marble moves the slowest, but also has the ability to boost. The metal marble can destroy some obstacles and is immune to all hazards, but is limited in its traversal ability.For the first 10 levels you only control a single marble per level and most of the challenge is in traversal. In the next 10 levels you control two marbles per level and can switch between them at will. This is where the puzzle elements become more prominent as you often have to hit switches or open areas with one marble to allow the other to proceed. The final 10 levels give you control of all three marbles, and this is where the games true potential comes closest to being reached. The last section of levels are where the most challenging platforming sections as well as the most complex puzzles reside, and these levels are quite good. The puzzles arent overly difficult, but they do get you thinking a fair amount and are well designed.The biggest shame about Lost Marbles is that the game doesnt really feel like it has truly begun until the last third of the game, and before you know it youve finished it. It definitely feels like there is room for a couple more sets of 10 levels that increase the challenge even further, but sadly that is not the case. While absolutely the best the game has to offer, the last section of the game sort of feels like it is introducing the concept of using all three marbles at once while holding back on the real challenge for future levels which dont exist.Closing Comments:Lost Marbles is certainly a game with a modest scope, though it doesnt make the most of it. When the game finally gets going, its excellent, but more than half the content feels like preparation for the real game, and just as things start getting good the game is over. The game controls very well and has some really well designed levels, but there is simply not enough of it. Lost Marbles feels like a great proof of concept, but not a full featured game. Whats here is absolutely worth playing, just dont expect to get much more than an hour or two out of it.", "date": "January 14, 2014", "grade": 3.5}
