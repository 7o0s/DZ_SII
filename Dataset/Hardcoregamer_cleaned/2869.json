{"name": "Operation Darkness", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=31171", "text": "Operation Darkness starts like other any video game based on World War II: you play as part of a division of heroic Allies (British, in this case), and end up in a unit that specializes in behind-enemy-lines operations. You start taking the fight to Hitler, and get to hear lots of really old guns firing, bombs going off, and fighter planes flying overhead. Pretty basic stuffyou may as well be playing Super Call of Duty RPG.Then a few missions in, everything changes for the awesome. Zombies, vampires and living skeletons start popping out of the groundand that unit youve been fighting with? They werent what they seemed, either.Seems what really happened during WWII is that Hitler got control of the undead, and was using them to turn the tide of the war in his favor. Fortunately, on your side are a clan of werewolves, and what pretty much amounts to the Occult League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Fireballs and wolf claws join machine guns and rocket launchers, and a good time is had by all.Take Advance Wars and Fire Emblem, toss them in a blender, add much bigger maps than either of those two titles, and a way cooler premise than either series has ever come up with, set the whole shebang on puree, and you have Operation Darkness. (Heck, after Days of Ruins story made me roll my eyes out of their sockets, this was so much a breath of fresh air for me its not even funny.) We had to write up the official strategy guide for this thing, which usually means playing a game until were sick of it. To ODs credit, that didnt really happen here, though Lord knows we came awful close on many an occasion. (Occupational hazards, dontcha know.)This is because OD has a lot to love about it. Its presented in a different way from most strategy games: that is, up close and personal. Theres no way to see the entire map from a top-down view, and thats because, for an SRPG, these maps are absolutely hugetheyre battlefields in the truest sense. Instead, theres a lot of theatrical camera work going on as units attack and defend, and lots of motion blur on impacts. It has a large selection of WWII-era weaponry, along with just enough magic on both sides to make things interesting. All of these armaments are used well, such as the implementation of cover that grenades can be thrown over, the abundant and very satisfying use of sniper rifles, or the, uh, ability to punch or slash a tank to death. Fine, so two out of three isnt bad.Every battle is epic, and rare are the moments where you will have any sort of upper hand. Its to the point where you have an auto-revive ability just to deal with the amount of times your characters will inevitably get one-shotted by tanks. Its also to the point where a new and novel strategic hookthe preemptive-action-manipulating Cover systemwas implemented so that your party system could better get the drop on the hordes of enemies that come towards your meager party. Picking off armies of German soldiers with sniper rifles before they even get a chance to take their turns is one of gamings most cathartic experiences, let me tell you.What Im trying to say here is that this game does not play around, but it makes sure that youre having fun when you do. Between the games star power, the over-the-top story (seriously, one of the later boss battles pits you against Hitler himself, who has dark wizard powers and calls forth *giant freaking dragons*) and the solid play mechanics, therell be a lot to keep you busy and hooked.It also throws in something novelcooperative play over Xbox Live. You and up to four friends can play in bonus missions that are unlocked as you play through the campaign. Your reward for victory is a German weapon (usually one that can only be obtained in limited quantities by looting corpses in battle) being unlocked for purchase back at your home base in the single-player campaign. Its a shame the entire campaign isnt co-op, but whats here is still great to play, and those rewards are really useful. So hats off.And now, the part of the review where I talk about how no game is perfect!There are a few nitpicky issues in OD that may affect full enjoyment of the title. The greatest of these is the graphics. They are, quite simply, original-Xbox caliber. True, some of the 360s power is used for the gigantic battlefields which stay on-screen in real-time, but those character models and territory textures are *old*. The camera is also of issue, though not quite as much as you might have heard. Once a player gets the hang of selecting units with the bumpers and trigger buttons, and using the camera only for quick surveillance or line-of-sight, then the issue is moot. Play smarter, not harder, kids.The last issue is the difficulty. OD is by no means unbeatable, or even unfair, but as mentioned above, it is tough as nails. Much like its presentation, its game mechanics are set up in stark contrast to other strategy games, where solid defense tends to win the day. In OD, youve got to go in hard, fast, and explosive, making sure to kill as many units as humanly possible in every turn you take, because youre always so vastly outnumbered. People who die (at least, the ones who dont trigger an instant mission failure when they bite it) stay dead, and once you take an action, even simple movement, theres no way to undo ityoure committed. Towards the end of the game, your adversaries get astronomical speed boosts, such that level-grinding (though fortunately not *too* much of it) is mandatory. This will all prove jarring, but youll get used to it.Closing Comments:", "date": "June 24, 2008", "grade": 3.5}
