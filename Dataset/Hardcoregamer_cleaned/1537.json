Its not just folks in the west creating such titles either, as doujin teams or individuals in Japan are hard at work on their own. Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon is one such product that comes to us from desunoya and was published on Steam by Sekai Project. Yep, those now incredibly well-known visual novel publishers have added another non-VN to their library (next to RaidersSphere4th). The question is whether or not this flirtation with other genres results in successful Steam releases or not. Really, it all depends on how good Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon is.The gameplay provided is surprisingly simple. Playing as Tobari, players must trek through increasingly challenging 2D stages, fighting monsters, flipping switches, avoiding projectiles, and taking down end-stage bosses. As far as all thats concerned the game doesnt seem particularly inspired. Where Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon distinguishes itself is in a focus on magical powerups. At the start of any stage Tobari is just equipped with her standard melee weapon to whack enemies to death at close range. But sometimes, upon killing wizards or other enemies, a spell orb pops out. If you grab one then itll be added into her weapon slot. As long as she doesnt get killed herself before the end of the level, magical attacks become a new means of fighting back.Spells come in a great variety of types, from simple flaming fireballs to electric balls that travel straight along curving pathways. Sometimes, magic feels overpowered, and at other times is completely annoying. Take, for example, the lightning bolt. Its great at stopping enemies both on the ground and in the air but does no good to creatures hiding underneath platforms. The bolt simply wont pass through solid objects, leaving you to clean up the enemy by hand if desired. Learning the pros and cons of each magical skill will probably even lead to inadvertent death a few times. If for whatever reason youre left spell-less before a boss, usually you can hit up a strategically-placed store and purchase some means of assistance right beforehand.Unlike a lot of actual classic platformers, theres also a storyline to be found in Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon. It plays out with anime sprites and text boxes a lot like a visual novel. However, these sequences only come around the end of levels and are pretty uninteresting. Obviously, the strength of this title is meant to be its platforming play, not storytelling. Its fair to say that folks arent playing for the visuals either. Sure, its not a totally hideous game or anything, but beyond the anime girls and cute little enemies backdrops leave tons to be desired. Ah well, they serve their purposes as stages well enough, despite much creativity in that regard.The biggest issue at play is simply that controls arent quite there yet. When going through a platformer you usually tend to expect some form of precision from the controlled character. In Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon, theres a bit of wobbliness involved. Until you finally get a hang of Tobaris quirks, youll likely face a few completely avoidable deaths due to misjudging jumps and sliding off platforms. Without those user-controlled mistakes, the game isnt actually too ridiculously challenging. Its just a new platformer which introduces magical skills into the equation. To be fair, the three heart life bar might prove difficult for some players to manage, though. Just try to play it slow and only hit heart pickups when one is actually needed. If its grabbed before hand itll be consumed despite being useless.So what happens when you have a cutesy game but average range gameplay? Basically, it fails to keep one compelled for particularly long bursts of gameplay. Although there are six main worlds to clear, theres no clear hook to make your way through them all. Only completionists may feel the need to do so, especially given the fact that there is an EX world, not to mention other secrets to discover. Finally, speedrunners may appreciate achievements targeted at clearing challenging worlds within a short timeframe (not to mention with a limited amount of deaths as well).Closing Comments:Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon offers cute anime characters, magic and adequate platforming in a serviceable package.Even with a few high points, however, theres not much reason for 2D platforming fans to give this one a look. There are all sorts of platformers available for the same price or cheaper which offer greater value (in regards to length, challenge, creativity, or all of the above). Mostly, this is a purchase for those who are willing to show their support for doujin creators. Tobari and the Night of the Curious Moon is a mouthful of a title that isnt as magical as desired.", "date": "May 28, 2015", "grade": 2.5}
