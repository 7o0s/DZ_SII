{"name": "Runers", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=101328", "text": "Do you happen to be searching for a new roguelike to play? Or what about a game with lots of crafting? Neither of these buzzwords seem to generate much attention anymore. Its a real shame because seriously cool titles are being passed up due to simple oversaturation. If youre still reading this then heres a suggestion: dont overlook Runers. Yes, its a game with roguelike elements (and crafting!) but in ways that make perfect sense. Unlike a fair bit of other modern roguelike titles, it also brings a serious challenge to players.Runers may have just landed out of seemingly nowhere but it hit the ground running. Of course, you might not be able to tell much from the screenshots. Visually, it doesnt appear much different from other pixelated top-down dungeon crawlers. Its only once you get past the average aesthetics that you realize the gameplay is tremendously fully featured. At the very start of a game you get to choose between twenty distinct races and twenty classes as well. After reviewing all of those its finally time to go on a dungeon run. Thats when the game reveals that those forty different initial stats and skills are only the beginning.Gameplay seems pretty simple at first. In twin stick shooter fashion the character runs with WASD while they can shoot in any direction via mouse. As for now theres no built in gamepad support. Each player starts with one measly attack fired with the left mouse button. This doesnt last long. Some enemies drop runes and these usher in a wealth of crafting options. At any point players can check their rune inventory and combine them. By combining two or three (alongside other boosts) you create new attacks. There are nearly 300 spells to create in all which means characters can be tailored pretty damn well. Although there is a tutorial theres still a few crafting aspects that feel unclear. Even so, after experimenting for a while its easy to create powerful new spells.Spells themselves get docked to the left or right mouse button as well as to a couple hotkeys. Holding down both mouse buttons at once is a great way to inflict heavy damage wherever you go. Keeping up a strong offensive is important thanks to rooms being absolutely packed with enemies. Did you think Runers would go easy on you in the first few dungeons? Nope! Almost immediately the game flanks players with a cavalcade of creatures. After a while handling teeming masses is just the norm. That doesnt make it any easier but you do eventually start to strategize for mob control. As is expected of roguelikes, dying forces players to start over with a fresh build. Thankfully any attempt can be saved and loaded once meaning you dont have to play for hours straight once you finally get a good run.Although creating new spells is a large part of the game thats not all there is on offer. Youve also got traits to choose from upon every level up. Currently theres fifty of those available. Alongside regular dungeon rooms theres also event rooms and boss sections. Event rooms focus on accomplishing a specific goal, such as surviving in a room with multiplying monsters for forty seconds. If you tend to like these challenges theres a special challenge mode available as well. Here you can complete and unlock more special rooms whenever. As with everything else, theres a ton of challenges available.Closing Comments:", "date": "September 2, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
