{"name": "XIII", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=393108", "text": "For all the continuing, growing success the PS2 was creating for Sony around the turn of the 21st century  and all the intrigue offered to Microsofts Xbox as the new kid on the console block  its easy to forget that even if still carrying the mantra of a first-party machine, Nintendos then newest piece of hardware, the Gamecube, was still host to opportunities to look beyond the companys own earnest ensemble of IPs. Even if some were not entirely tied down to the platform alone, games like Burnout, Super Monkey Ball, Soul Calibur II, Tales of Symphonia and Ikaruga were diverse and successful enough for those tied down to a Gamecube to feel anything but deprived of third-party options. When talking specifically about those that were exclusive to the little purple box (least for a time), the Gamecubes library from launch up to the mid-2000s was, to put a positive spin on things, an interesting time of experimentation, eccentricity, grander concepts and treading of ground Nintendo themselves may not have dared cover.Some proved successful with titles like Eternal Darkness and Viewtiful Joe breaking from out the perceived, traditional, family-friendly Nintendo mold; some like Killer7 garnering a cult following that still holds to this day; then there was the likes of Geist and P.N.03, different they may have been, not working out in the long-run. An adaptation of previous, established material it may have been, XIII  inspired by the Belgian graphic novel series of the same name  was another one of these games that fell into the occult middle-ground of diversified ideas that may or may not have worked well for everyone on a commercial front. But it was the games cel-shaded stylings coupled with its FPS premise that, despite a middling reception, attracted enough for it to be far from one of the many lost causes in the Gamecubes still-respected library of third-party releases.Indeed, as far from substantial a property it may seem  a far cry from the Final Fantasys and the Resident Evils of our world  the news of a modern-day remake of XIII, if not one to set the world on fire, was sufficient enough to intrigue those who still remember the original 2003 adaptations novel comic book-like stylings. Complete with panel-set cut-aways and onomatopoeia captions. Some of those familiar, visual quirks are here to be found; in much the same way, the cel-shaded coating to your player-characters hands and weapons are quick to proclaim their presence in a game whose linear set of levels and erratic shifting from one set of weapons to wield to the next, are relatively unchanged. Even still, as little fanfare or commercial visibility XIII initially held, there was still an interest to see how this cult-garnering Gamecube release could stand in 2020. If youve even skimmed already-published thoughts or caught even the slightest wind at some of the developers own responses post-release, rest assured you already have a fairly rounded conclusion at how things have, sadly, turned out in this case. 2020s XIII remake is bad; terrible in fact. But its only when you go into a little more detail that you see just how far off the mark PlayMagics envisioning of a cult favorite really is. The word terrible might not cut it in fact. The best (if one can even denote it as such) place to start is probably with the performance; charitable it might have been to not hold as much disdain for it on consoles, XIIIs quality on PC is bafflingly all over the place. Far from demanding the remakes simplified aesthetic and near two-decade old retaining of level design is, 2020 XIII struggles to find a sense of consistency in this department. Dipping wildly to below even 30FPS at the most unusual of moments and set-pieces. Moments that youd assume were not distinctly cut-off or separate from anywhere else; trudging through one of the many linear corridors of such, suddenly halving your frame-rate to then return to some semblance of normality just as quickly. Even with this taken out of the equation, the remakes general treatment of its production and of the delivery of cutscenes in-between missions  or even just to fill out part of the story  seems shockingly dismissive on top. Theres an unflattering, compressed quality to several moments of the narrative. So much so it feels like youre watching a low quality stream of what the game actually entails when in realitynothis is what the game deems satisfactory. Its not the first instance and its certainly not the last in what feels like a remake not so much disrespecting, but rather mistreating its source material.Perhaps theres an argument to be had that the originals design philosophy is itself out-dated; that PlayMagic are essentially in a lose-lose situation here. Whereby appealing to those who want the remake to play out as the original did means an unflattering level of innovation. There possibly is some truth to that  that a lot of XIIIs level design and geometric rigidness or reliance on corridor structure does eventually show its age in countless ways. But it doesnt excuse the sheer sloppiness and shallow effort placed in the other parts  parts that cant be shrugged off as a victim of age or something thats come before. And if its not the exact same, minuscule bundle of sound effects used for all manner of enemies, bad guys and grunts  of varying factions you meet along the way  its the lifeless way in which rag-doll animations play out from first confrontation to said enemys inevitable demise. A demise which, laughably, looks almost as if its playing out in its own, pre-determined frame-rate divorced from that of the rest of the game or your own preferred settings. Much like the visually-compressed cutscenes, XIII feels all the more cobbled together with little cohesion, let alone care, for whats going on all around. Credible a mentality it may be to try to be faithful to the original, all it does is make the many technical glitches and hapless examples of enemy intelligence  and all the bad cases of animation that pop up  stand out even more. Enemy AI, in moments of implied stealth, struggling to spot you from point blank range; in others, even more bizarrely, dramatically returning to some form of normality having entered an alert state not a few seconds later. And of course, enemies so willingly to turn a corner so you can blast them straight in the face, one after another. Thats something that cant be put down to or waved away at trying to keep faithful to one thing or another. The number of times one can get in and out of a fire-fight with little concern to ones health, even if against those wielding something like a shotgun or a long-range rifle. Enemy AI is non-existent in this respect; where Left Alive last year felt like a case of AI possessing seemingly inhuman, supernatural reflexes and awareness alike, XIII is the exact opposite in this regard. Hostiles who just stand about in a gameplay system that appeases neither shooter fans nor those looking for more stealth and strategy.Providing of course that the gunplay is actually worth investing here, which it sadly is not. Beyond just the blatant lack of punch and responsiveness that weapons have in your possession, you can get away with taking enemies out with your handgun  without ever aiming down the sight  all the while the exact same audio files play out to denote a crying/dying goon. Its a dull, stale, uneventful slog whose choppy enemy collapsing and dying animations and gunplay become so quickly mundane and tiresome to listen to, the amateurish delivery of such moments arent even laughable. Many of the remakes attempts to deliver a set-piece tinged with tension or dramatics or even just having to tactically stealth your way through an area fall by the wayside. One instance of infiltrating a base  making sure you take down enemies before they can activate an alarm  even on regular difficulty are pitifully easy to counter or deal with. So much so you could storm in guns blazing (still firing from the hip may I remind you) and foes will offer more than enough leeway for you to still succeed. Call it a lack of knowledge on what makes a good stealth sequence or worse, a near-offensive underestimating of a players ability, but moments such as these only heighten the tedium that XIII brings. That tedium is only baked further into some of the less-bombastic moments. Moments that should be as basic and as straightforward as they get and yet still find the time to come off as annoying. The animation on unlocking a door requires you standing in a specific point for both animation and action to register together. Reload animations for weapons like the handgun looking too indulgent and over-the-top than for their own good (despite the shotgun seemingly getting straight to the point). Even the appearing/disappearing assets that happen many a time throughout your travels. These can all be read, to some, as nitpicks but added up on a technical level, XIII is far from polished or presentable enough to be considered fluid.Then of course  perhaps the biggest culprit to players and notably fans of the original release  you have the undoing on some of the cel-shaded aesthetic for this remake. Namely in the character models and how they dont mesh. Again, it might be a case of PlayMagic having written themselves into a corner  how do you remake cel-shaded techniques when cel-shading is a practically ageless visual technique? The answer seems to be to remove it entirely and replace it with an art direction that, if anything, makes the remaining cel-shaded assets feel isolated and even more disjointed with the rest of the game. Closing Comments:With the brilliant heights that remakes of Resident Evil 2, for example, achieved last year, it felt inevitable that a remake like XIII would stand as the exact opposite result in that regard. Whether or not youre the type to maybe excuse some of the failings as unanswerable solutions to an aged approach to game design, it doesnt take away from just how little care and effort PlayMagic have placed in the other departments. Enemy intelligence thats practically non-existent, an overuse on what seems like a meager, hurriedly-compiled assembly of audio and visual assets. On top of a gunplay premise that looks, sounds and feels objectively worse than that of the 2003 Gamecube original. 2020s XIII is a broken, buggy and boring rendition of a game long-time fans deserve a better interpretation of.", "date": "November 30, 2020", "grade": 1.5}
