Since the original NES, gamers have excitedly pushed themselves to rush to the end of a game, all to beat a length of time and earn their place on the leaderboards. YouTube videos of gamers playing Super Mario Brothers, Banjo-Kazooie or Goldeneye 007 at a frantic pace have become common; in a way, the speed run has always been a concept of gaming athleticism. That precision, however, has made the speed run inaccessible to many, mostly due to the ideas limited range for error. One tiny missed jump can mean the difference between first place and second; every bit of time, no matter how small, matters in a speed run.10 Second Ninja is what happens when you base an entire game around the idea of a speed run.10 Second Ninja is a platformer where each level requires you to defeat all enemies within a tiny ten-second-long period. Your ninja character has two main moves: a slashing melee attack and a shuriken projectile. Though the melee attack is unlimited, the shuriken can only be used three times until you run out of ammunition. In addition to the attacks, enemies come in different forms: some are tougher and require multiple hits, while some can be taken out instantly, even from a distance. Environmental hazards like stalactites and falling platforms offer more indirect ways to attack enemies, and new tricks like the shamelessly Valve-inspired portals allow for projectiles to attack from a longer distance. Your ninja is relatively well-equipped to take out enemies, but your biggest enemy will always be the clock. Finding out the best way to set up each collective kill is a puzzle of sorts and many of the solutions have a flow to them, a smooth motion for the best offense. The game also doesnt start the clock until you move or attack, so as long as you stay still, you can plan your tactics for as much time as you need.Depending on how quickly you complete a stage, youre awarded stars, with the most stars earned with faster completion. The games incentive to earn a better time might be interesting, but one huge problem makes the game a long, arduous trudge: progression in the game requires a certain amount of stars. You will not be able to reach the next stage until you have obtained a certain amount of stars; if you happen to complete every stage with a one-star ranking, you will not be able to progress. While the game clearly wants you to nail a tighter time, there are many times where a three-star ranking is mandatory to continue; you cannot complete the game unless you get at least a few perfect three-star rankings. This is an extremely demanding quota, when even an okay time is simply not enough to move on to the next level. To make matters worse, since this follows the speed run mentality, even the smallest misstep can change a two star to a one star, requiring you to start over and retry the stage again. This means that there is absolutely no room for messing up. A single missed jump can mean the difference between getting a speedy time for a required three stars, or a so-so time for a two-star ranking and not having enough to stars to unlock the next stage. The total lack of leniency makes the game less exciting and more frustrating. In many situations, the game locks you out of the next stage and says you werent fast enough. Do it again.And really, the game isnt very long or complex. Despite some changes in aesthetic or environment, the game is a very repetitive experience. Repeated retries might have flow with extremely fast respawn rates and tight controls, but youll almost always find yourself trying over and over until you make a pitch perfect time. Your success can come down to the smallest millisecond; the margin of error is unfairly miniscule, like any speed run, but in this case, the pressure doesnt come from working toward the top of the leaderboards. The pressure comes from simply beating a level. 10 Second Ninja doesnt have much content either. Unlockable stages and funny boss fights are good, but 40 challenges for $10 US is very paltry when compared to other similar games like Super Meat Boy, which has hundreds of challenges to complete.The presentation is stylish at times, but there are a ton of moments that simply dont have any personality. The cutscenes featuring main antagonist Robot Hitler (which is just a floating robot head that looks like Hitler) and his minions are funny at times, but the dialogues tone becomes tiresome and predictable after a few levels. Its simplistic to an almost absurd degree; 10 Second Ninja has the design of a browser flash game or a mobile title. Music has some okay Eastern-inspired ninja tunes, but its still bland and rarely gives off any kind of distinctive style. 10 Second Ninja, from start to finish, is just too simplistic for its own good, topping off the messy design with a very problematic approach to improvement.Closing Comments:10 Second Ninja is a game made for speed runners and no one else. It captures the rush of making every motion count, while bouncing around stages with ninja-esque precision and flow, but doesnt present any sort of leniency from that idea. A single millisecond of error can lock you out of progression, requiring you to play the level again just to trim a second or two off your time. Its a finicky design that breeds repetition at almost every turn. While the levels do offer some new tricks and the controls are quite solid, 10 Second Ninja forces players to improve instead of coercing them to. You never feel like youre improving your time out of personal ambition; instead, youre improving your time because you will not be able to progress any further without shaving off a few milliseconds, even if that means another thirty tries to do so. If you love the idea of speed runs and like the thrill of making every move count to beat the clock, then 10 Second Ninja might be for you. For everyone else, though, 10 Second Ninja is a repetitive and dull game, one whose philosophy on improvement is player-hostile for the entire ride.", "date": "on April 4, 2014", "grade": 2.0}
