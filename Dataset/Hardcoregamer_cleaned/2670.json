{"name": "Johnny Impossible", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=22087", "text": "Johnnys had a busy year in 2012. Hes been in LCD and beat-em up adventures, had Western shootouts, and now has to do the impossible  stop Dr. Wang from unleashing his giant laser upon the world. In order to stop a laser-guided doomsday, Johnny becomes a spy and goes through a variety of levels with a slew of gadgets at his disposal. Grappling hooks, night vision goggles and magnet gloves are just a few of the items youll use to progress. The core game is basically an action-platformer with a few minor twists thrown in.One is a time limit. Like Johnnys first adventure, theres only a short period of time to complete the game, making replaying stages a must so they can be moved through as efficiently as possible. Theres a lot of trial and error involved as stages must be moved through stealthily to avoid being seen by either robots or detected by lasers, and the only way to avoid them is to use the gadgets well and combine them with some puzzle-platforming. If theres a robot with a giant flashlight on patrol, youll need to duck into a door, wait for it to not face you, hop out, then blast it with your stun gun to move past. Moving past a laser trap might require using the grappling hook carefully to stop right before a point where a laser will eventually shoot out, and then making sure that theres enough time left on the item to complete the task.Every gadget found has a little meter attached to it and cant be used when it runs out. For some items, like the grappling hook, this works fairly well, but it seems to drain really quickly for the magnet gloves, and even faster for the night vision goggles. Not using them means theyll only be a small pocket of light around Johnny, making stages much harder to traverse when shrouded in darkness. It also ironically means that youre more open to being seen, and if youre detected, death is a near-certainty unless a door or entrance/exit is nearby. Being hit by anything takes two seconds away, and at about the halfway mark, a robot comes after you and snatches you like that giant hand in the Batman: Animated Series episode.Outside of the things that are different, Johnny Impossible feels like a Kim Possible game  a theme furthered by the spy theme and music, but it doesnt play as well, or even look as good as KPs GBA adventures. Much of that is due to the controls, which are functional, but not quite as precise they should be. Jumping is also a bit stiff, and having to press up to get out of a crawling position seems a bit needless. Jumping off of the grappling hook is also a pain  sometimes youll go where you want to, but many times you wont. The controls as a whole just feel off and constantly give a sense for how much better they could be.Visually, Johnny Impossible looks fine, but doesnt impress in any way. The graphical style is true to Johnnys other games, but the limited animation doesnt work very well for a platformer. Johnny Impossibles animation is incredibly limited and the game itself doesnt look as good as it could. Everything looks fairly generic, including Johnny since hes just out to look like Bond, and the environments are your standard genre fare too. Theres little to separate it from the pack aestetically, and thats never a good thing. Similarly, the music sounds like B-level Kim Possible background music, and while that fits the genre, it isnt very memorable while playing the game, let alone outside of it. Theres nothing here youll be humming later.Closing Comments:", "date": "December 27, 2012", "grade": 2.5}
