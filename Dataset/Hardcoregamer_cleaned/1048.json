{"name": "The Walking Dead: Michonne  Episode 3: What We Deserve", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=204041", "text": "And so weve reached the final episode in Telltales little side story, The Walking Dead: Michonne. Throughout this whole adventure with the comics most badass character, I was hoping that we would be building up to some epic conclusion, something that would really throw a curve ball at the player. And finally, it was about to be delivered. Near the end, Michonne was in a negotiation with Norma, the big bad of the game, and thanks to some prior choices I had made, we were about to end things peacefully. Norma was keeping her word, and despite some walkers in the area, it looked like our gang would get to stay behind peacefully. Indeed, it was shaping up to be a neat subversion of the sort of violent standoffs between groups of survivors and dictators found in this franchise, and in zombie stories like this in general.Then a loud, audible whine was heard. It turns out it was the developers, saying Awwwww, but we worked so hard to create an epic action scene that ensues when things go south! And now you just want to skip it? Nuh uh, screw that. And so they pressed an override button, and the next thing I knew, one of the characters in the negotiation did a very contrived thing that set forth a chain reaction of contrived things, and suddenly things had been forced to go south and lead to an action scene. Any hopes one may have had for this game standing out from its predecessors and doing something unique died right there, all for the sake of a QTE-filled climax.Look, we all know that Telltale games  and several other games based around making choices, for that matter  still have set paths that need to be followed, regardless of how much they emphasize the supposed impact that your choices have. Typically, though, its easy to overlook such an illusion of choice if the story is still extremely well-written and presented. Such a case of blatant railroading, though, cannot be ignored. And it doesnt really helps that it leads to a major pacing imbalance. The first half of the episode is spent wandering around the household Michonne and company are currently staying in, performing a few tasks, then for the second half its basically a QTE-fest, switching gears all of a sudden.Speaking of which, even the action sequences here feel a bit toned down. Michonnes sheer badassery that made them such a delight in the previous two episodes doesnt appear to be on display as much this time around, so things feel a tad more generic, with standard gunshots, stabbing, and moving heavy objects. Theres not much point in talking about the look and sound of the game as well, since its exactly the same is it was in the previous episodes, so you can just cut and paste what was was said in the last review. Its still all well done (and Samira Wiley is still a treat), but really, there isnt anything new at all here, not even a new location by the end.So is there anything in the final episode thats truly worth it beside the usual stuff, you may ask? Indeed there is! While the plot taking place in the games reality sadly takes a nosedive in terms of interesting content, Michonnes hallucinations over her missing children continue to haunt her. We finally get some resolution regarding that dark chapter of her past, and the conclusion to it is quite moving indeed. Sadly, it ends up also being tied into a completely ludicrous moral choice, but it does provide some more insight into Michonnes character, which is definitely welcome.Closing Comments:By the end of What We Deserve, Michonne and her companions find themselves basically right back where they started, right before the credits roll with a song that actually fades out before all of the names even finish rolling, creating an uncomfortable silence. Yes, this episode almost literally goes out not with a bang, but with a whimper. It is still competent, at the very least, but that doesnt excuse the weak story. I hate to sound like a broken record, but The Walking Dead: Michonne should not have been episodic, as things are over still too quick and feel stripped of the more interesting gameplay bits from before to help support it. Suffice it to say, the tale of Michonne deserves a much better ending than this.", "date": "April 27, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
