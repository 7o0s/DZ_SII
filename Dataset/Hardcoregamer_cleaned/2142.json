Launched on XBLA in 2009, the supremely simplistic platformer drew attention due to its high level of difficulty. Since then it has launched on PSN, Android, iOS, and Windows Store. Finally, Steam players are getting their shot at the game as well.With a name like The Impossible Game it has a lot to live up to. Once players take the first level for a spin theyll likely feel it really is impossible. The 2D platformer autoscrolls and ask that you simply jump over obstacles or refrain from jumping in certain circumstances. Being armed with a jump button and nothing else makes this a platformer in the purest sense. Yes, there is a flag function to set up checkpoints, but that serves as a friendly retry function rather than an element of gameplay.Games in the runner genre have grown increasingly complex over the years, which makes The Impossible Game a refreshingly simple one. Thanks to the simple and precise keyboard controls, any mistake is all on you. If you wish to succeed then your full attention must be devoted to playing and, eventually, memorizing stages. Some jumps dont require pinpoint precision, but others do. Being aware of what comes next is integral to timing these types of jumps as well as psyching yourself up for impending super tough sections.Practice mode allows players to drop a checkpoint flag at any spot in the stage. Once they screw up, theyll be returned to the flag instead of the beginning. This is a great way to practice on tough sections before trying a non-practice mode run later. Just be careful with where you drop the flags! Its very easy to accidentally drop a checkpoint at a bad spot, making it useless.At first, players may be disappointed by the fact that the game only includes four levels (five if you count the original stage). In comparison to other platformers it definitely seems to be lacking in this department. However, each stage is long and difficult enough to make completing them all a very long process indeed. At five hours in, I still find myself struggling to complete any one stage without using practice mode liberally. However, its hard to put down because you want to prove the experience is not impossible.The Impossible Game succeeds where other purposefully difficult games fail. By offering precise, simple gameplay it is able to lure players into believing they can beat it if theyre persistent enough. Missed jumps and timing feel 100% your fault. At least, thats the case with keyboard controls. For whatever reason the Xbox 360 gamepad jumps feel a lot less precise. Sometimes it seems jumps dont even register or will cause two jumps instead of one. Definitely opt for non-gamepad controls unless you must use a controller.Unlike many modern platformers, there is little focus on creating gorgeous visuals. This one has a very simple aesthetic of colored shapes and a barren backdrop. It doesnt live up to the standards that have been set by its plentiful successors, but at least there are no distracting visuals to screw up platforming. The music is pretty excellent, although official stage tracks stop playing once you enter practice mode. Instead, a soothing new track plays the whole way through.Once you do complete the included stages you can try out the level editor. This included editor allows the player to create stages alongside their own music. Creative (or sadistic) players will definitely enjoy making superbly difficult stages. Once created, user stages can be shared with others. As of right now there is no Steam Workshop support, though. There may never be Workshop support because any copyrighted songs would be transferred along with the new stages. However, users are still sharing creations in the Steam Community and on fansites.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 14, 2014", "grade": 3.5}
