{"name": "Shadow Complex Remastered", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=199854", "text": "Saturday morning cartoons used to be the world to me. Somehow Id regulate my sleeping schedule to wake up at 7am, something thats only gotten harder as an adult, and bungle downstairs to curl up in blankets with the latest installment of Fox Kids. Nowadays the cartoons dont seemingly pack the same punch and its been awhile since Ive had that feeling. Shadow Complex Remastered has reminded me what an episode of Action Man used to do because it feels like one of those Saturday morning cartoons. Its also reminded me why I slowly faded away from them.Shadow Complex is a 2.5 dimensional action-adventure platformer. You exist in a 3D environment but movement is limited to the x and y axis. Exploration is confined to these rules, but enemies can move into the background which requires you to shoot outside your available plane of action. You move your character with the left analog stick and aim with the right analog stick. Its a sidescrolling game so you dont have access to a crosshair, but you do get a laser pointer attached to your gun. This allows you to line up a shot before pulling the trigger and gives you the necessary perspective to land precision hits from far away. Its all fine and dandy until an enemy appears in the background. This happens with frequency and youll soon find yourself aiming up to hit an enemy behind you only to completely flub the shot by aiming directly above your avatar. I never quite figured out the best solution to killing enemies in the z axis. There is an auto aim feature that lines up shots in the background, but the issue isnt solved when battling multiple enemies. Youll attempt to set priority on killing a background enemy, but the game will assume youre just shooting at the enemies in front of you and vice versa. Its frustrating to not feel in control when youre losing health.Head shots are normally awarded with all sorts of confetti in other shooters, but when its a 2D sidescroller it especially feels like an achievement. Combat isnt all shooting, though it is fun to nail an opponent in the head from afar. You can also do melee takedowns when up close and personal that zoom the camera in to see all the glory. Some of the most enjoyable moments come after donning the famous suit because then your punches send enemies flying in rag doll goodness. The flourish of music that swells after all enemies are cleared in an area is a satisfying signature to engagements in Shadow Complex.The story centers around an underground base thats home to a terrorist organization whos preparing to take over San Francisco and ultimately ignite civil war in the United States. You play as Jason who discovers the complex when his girlfriend Claire goes missing during a hiking trip. The beginning narrative is interesting enough and creates a sense of foreboding thatll drive you to dig deeper into the plot. Jason stays consistent throughout which is great because hes the main character, but unfortunately no other character holds any weight and thus the story falls apart in the second half.Youre drip fed information from guards in the game  la Metal Gear Solid where youll find yourself in a vent eavesdropping on a conversation. Other than those few story beats, youre mostly going back and forth with your girlfriend who never really takes center stage as a prominent character. The game does try to initiate a villain late in the plot, but his introduction is so sloppy and underwhelming that he never feels threatening.The plot could get away with this simplicity if it wasnt for the basic dialogue youre bombarded with halfway through that continually ramps up to reach a muzzled climax. There was a specific boss moment that I had to play over and over that caught me off guard as to how subpar some of the writing is. The moment that solidifies this comes later down the rabbit hole and will make your eyes roll.Shadow Complex is clearly inspired by Super Metroid and Castlevania. You explore a web of hallways and rooms as you unlock new abilities and collect new upgrades. There are plenty of secrets hidden throughout, perhaps even too many, but there isnt one good boss fight to be found. Sure, there are some boss encounters that will require you to use a new mechanic or recently acquired weapon, but none of them feel like a significant triumph. Rather they feel like annoying bullet sponges, some of them even unfair.The Remastered additions are nice, but none of them change the game for better or worse. Theres new melee takedowns, achievements and challenges that will give you extra content to playthrough if youd like. Theres also the up-rezzed graphics, but they dont really do the trick and the visuals still end up looking dated. It is pleasing to learn that the eventual PC release will feature customizable controller options and key bindings. Closing Comments: The thing about Saturday morning cartoons is that theyre packed into thirty minute segments. Yes, theyre often shallow subplots, but luckily they resolve before overstaying their welcome. Shadow Complex doesnt do that. It draws out a weak narrative and rarely rewards the player for continuing on. From a gameplay perspective the bosses speak for themselves; theyre bland and muddled. Looking back there is fun to be had sprinkled throughout, but the finale is so sour that its hard to see those moments.", "date": "March 29, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
