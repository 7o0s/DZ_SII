Hasnt everyone played through an Ace Attorney game and wondered what it would be like to play as Gumshoe? While we may never know, Jake Hunter: Detective Chronicles presents a pulpy alternative.The game is a generally straightforward adventure title, where the player guides Jake through three cases. The cases can be played in any order, and are all unlocked from the startit really feels like a collection of detective novels, and plays similarly.Jake Hunter works like a point-and-click adventure game, with the player visiting locations relevant to each case, questioning witnesses, and gathering necessary clues. After a player exhausts his options, he can always head back to the office and take a break. Jake will reflect on the days events, and will present the player with a quiz based on the information gathered during the day.If the player does well, Jake will figure out an important piece of the puzzle that progresses the story.The game is told from the perspective of the titular detective, and this adds a distinct -atmosphere; even the in-game hints fit into the detective novel theme. Click a button, and Jake will pull out a loose cigarette and light up. As hes smoking, hell talk about things he wants to get done, or places he thinks he should go: things a player can key in on if he gets stuck. Even the aforementioned office scene involves Jake relaxing with a hard-earned cigarette. Frankly, more detectives could use some of Jakes flair.While the game does a great job of providing an authentic detective feel, the story tends to hiccup in spots. While theres no real penalty for taking breaks at the office, the story can hang while you fish for enough clues to advance the plot. Also, the dialogue can have some bland moments, but overall the story is compelling enough to play through to the end. Each of the cases has a very satisfying resolution, and theres enough meat to warrant a couple plays through of each case.Closing Comments:", "date": "June 10, 2008", "grade": 3.0}
