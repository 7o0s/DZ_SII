{"name": "Dear RED  Extended", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=201846", "text": "Dear RED  Extended is possibly the most misleading name since miniature candy bars were named fun size. For example, members of the population who pass time on the porcelain throne with electronic devices could easily get two or three of this games endings while simply taking care of business. But unlike common prom night activities, not everything that ends as soon as it begins is an unsatisfactory disappointment.Dear RED  Extended is a visual novel, or novella, actually short story would be a more accurate description. The game has the player assume the role of Red, a girl whose mother was murdered when she was six years old. Vengeance was not among the family values that was taught during her upbringing, but bloodlust has been silently brewing within her so she decides to venture out and kill the man who took her mother from her. She arrives at his house armed with a knife to learn that he is caring for his own sick daughter. The game plays like a choose your own adventure book. Every interaction she has with the man who is simply identified as Murderer has the option to be truthful or to tell a lie. The choice made in the interaction with him effects what the next course of action is. Red could be with him getting to learn about his life, or she may be left unsupervised to snoop around his house.At the beginning the game prompts you to create a save file and urges you to save often. This must be a poke at RPGs that require several days worth of play time to complete. This game boasts having about 17 different endings, but each one can achieved within five minutes. Unlocking each ending is as easy as remembering what choices were made in earlier playthroughs. There is an interesting story in this game. To fully unravel it does require multiple playthroughs as each different path reveals different pieces. It was somewhat of a shock to have the end credits roll after about three minutes of playing. My first thought was I had completed the introduction and the rest of the game was going to open up.Some of the endings are pretty unsatisfactory, but playing a few more times revealed some of the more interesting ones. No single session ever told me the whole story, and some were much more revealing than others. While not bad, the idea behind this game exceed its execution. The concept is interesting and the overall presentation for the game is well done. There just is not a lot to it, and I cant help but think if the story was fleshed out some more the experience would be much more satisfying.To be fair, this game was originally released for Android devices where the shortness of it would make it an ideal way to kill time while waiting in line at a coffee shop or for an appointment. Playing it through Steam on PC reminded me of my time with Gone Home. It was enjoyable for the short while it lasted, and I appreciated the unorthodox approach to game design and originality. But once it has been played to completion, there is little to no reason to go back and experience it again.Closing CommentsDear RED  Extended is an interesting but very short visual novel. The brevity of the game serves as a double edged sword. On one hand it has appeal for quick pick up and play, and being able to experience different paths of the story in a short amount of time is an appealing way to pass the time. The downside is after you have gone down every possible direction and pieced together everything, there is little reason to go back and replay it. Even though every ending can be seen in one to two hours, this is a fairly unique game with an interesting concept, and there are many worse ways that amount of time can be spent.", "date": "April 11, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
