{"name": "Skully", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=384215", "text": "For a studio whose aim is to create fast-paced games that appeal to a wide assortment of players, theres an argument to be made that developers Finish Line Games clearly understand the appeal of linear platformers. Its never easy to hone in specifically on why the genre was so prevalent in the 90s. Not least for those who werent there during its rise and subsequent fall. But if theres one thing you can say positively about a game like Skully, its that it knows how its players think. Clearly having done their research as to the mind-set of those who still will into being a great, modern-day rendition of the kind of platformer Crash Bandicoot and the sort helped popularize. How its less about the principle satisfaction of completion  of finally reaching the end of some grueling course  but more to do with catching sight of the littler details and added incentives to put ones self in harms way for the sake of greater rewards.Insignificant spots of a level that anyone else might not take a second glance at, yet for those having been brought up on this genre growing up, understand that its a clever, subtle way of suggesting without outright proclaiming it so. Call it a personal bias or not, but its somewhat of a comfort to find ones suspicion and curiosity modestly rewarded in Skully. To be reminded of how games during the N64/PlayStation era successfully masked their obvious design/creative limitations to make for one addictive collectathon after another. With Skully, the homage it pays is clearly aimed at that same period in games. Linear stretches of levels where one can bounce their way to the top of a hill, whereupon a set number of collectibles are hanging. Alcoves and tucked-away sections the camera doesnt focus on by default, there to be discovered by way of a hidden path.Such suspicion doesnt always pay off  at times lending itself to being met with an invisible wall or two. But taken completely at face value, Skully is a modest recreation of the kind of experience that helped make past, pre-2000 entries a short-term burst of venture. The faithful recreation of the kind of levels we all loved to hate as kids is evident in the brightest, creative sparks of the games eighteen total levels and roughly eight to ten hour investment. When momentum  as much the physics dictating the controls  is on your side, Skullys simple premise and limited scope of level design manages to guide it through. When you eventually reach that precarious, panic-inducing segment where platforms are small and the previous checkpoint feels miles away, the set-up is enough that you can forgive the areas where the game doesnt find the means to attain a sense of pure originality. When it works, such things like the on-going narrative of feuding, deity-like siblings can be tossed to the side. As unsuccessful the game is at evoking a sense of humor with the kind of jokes and punchlines that seldom land and whose repeated reliance on such punch-lines  as much the one-note personalities on display  quickly turns into one too many rolling of the eyes. One can even look past the intentional decision to have cutscenes between levels play out in still frames. Though its still too much of a stretch to be convinced this is because of some thoughtful, aesthetic/artistic choice, rather than just a general disinterest in fully animating story beats.The point is, when Skully takes the time to properly populate its levels with thoughtful pockets of platforming segments  and even some momentary puzzle-solving to help vary the gameplay from time to time  the mechanics underpinning it all are sufficient in what theyre trying to achieve. Particularly when you find yourself tackling a level that isnt entirely linear by design, managing to find ways to loop back into itself and better disguise its obvious limitations, Skully if not completely original in its delivery, is enjoyable enough. Its when the player finally decides to tackle the core gimmick of swapping out golem forms where a lot of the problems start to arise. Regarding puzzle design itself, its only in the later stages of the game  specifically the final third whereupon ones abilities are arbitrarily added to without much reason as to why they were never there from the beginning  where these segments are engaging enough to require a thoughtful use of which golems are required and where/when. Outside of these lone moments though, Skullys core gimmick feels both under-utilized and sadly a little too bare to be deserving of the time the game dedicates. Welcome it is that some platforming scenarios can be resolved with anyone of the three forms  and that using them equips you with a secondary health bar of sorts  it isnt long before the requirement of a certain golem feels more like an unnecessary road-block rather than a worthwhile upgrade in ones travels.But whats made worse in these moments  and why they are as tedious as they are in Skully  primarily lies in how much time is wasted on the players part, swapping between one form and another. It may be shocking to read that theres no simple swap function here; instead requiring players physically hop in and out of individual golems in order to control them. Nor is there an ability to remove individual golems at one of the many clay pools that serve as both checkpoints and spawn areas for each required golem. Should you reach the maximum, allotted amount of three golems, the game forces you, for whatever reason, to dismiss all forms currently active rather than allowing you to select which golem to dispose and which one to substitute it for. Its an odd and annoying oversight on the developers part. The kind of oversight that unfortunately extends into the technical aspects. Sad as it is to report that arriving at around half-way through the game was met with an immediate crash  corrupting ones save data and requiring me to restart the entire game from scratch. And while this is perhaps the most extreme Skully gets when it comes to its less-pleasant performance issues, its by no means the only one to encounter. But while the evident texture pop-in that occurs at the start of every level can, again, be forgiven, the same cant be said for the inconsistent manner at which physics are applied here. Thus for a game whose platforming and latter, more daring, feats require such an aspect to be running flawlessly, the sheer number of frustrating instances eventually work against the gameplays appeal.Bad enough that controlling certain golems in these situations can result in some blatantly uneven examples of momentum cancelling out. But when you find your carefully-calculated roll-up onto a hill, suddenly get caught on some invisible scuff in the world geometry, or the basic ability in latching onto vines not work for whatever reason, Skullys gameplay  in all its genuine, welcome challenge  can quickly become an unnecessary nuisance. And a frequent one at that. Much like the aforementioned, primary gimmick of swapping/controlling golems to use during platforming and puzzle-solving alike, some of the other attempts at evoking past genre gimmicks like the infamous chase sequence levels are sadly not as well-delivered as its more traditional platforming segments. Suffering not only from some needless rubber-banding  which in effect rather undermines your attempt to get as much distance between you and the approaching threat  and equally-needless pulling-out of the camera. Resulting in one too many troubles with depth perception. Closing Comments:Its hard to hold the positives in ones mind without reminiscing on the kind of game Skully couldve been. Yet take out the personal ambition of this being some grand, 3D adventure to explore in another scenario and Skully is still too much a case of good intentions marred by bad or downright odd decision-making in parts. While die-hard followers of the genre are sure to scrape together some joy in the spots of twitch-heavy platforming and hunt for collectibles the game affords, the lingering of one too many time-heavy design choices and back-end issues means the best Skully can hope for is the perception of a flawed charming-enough effort. Whether you can look past the inconsistent physics work, rough technical performance or the narratives hackneyed attempt at something resembling personality, will depend on how invested you are in the gameplay. Its a rough, uneven, disappointingly-middle of the road trek. But for all its faults, Skullys acknowledging and understanding of 3D platformings appeal does count for something. A game whose heart is most certainly in the right place.", "date": "August 4, 2020", "grade": 3.0}
