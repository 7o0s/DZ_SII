{"name": "Concursion", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=97478", "text": "Its hard enough for a game to execute one genre well, but when you have one that tries to do multiple genres and then sub-genres within those genres, the results can be disastrous. Luckily, Concursion isnt that kind of game. Concursion starts off with a simple evil dude captures the princess setup and then transitions into a Mario-style head-bopping platformer. This makes perfect sense before things change again. Out of relatively nowhere, youre in a 2D side-scrolling shoot-em-up stage. From there, you get a Strider-esque action-platformer, a button holding-based jetpack game, a Pac-Man clone, and zoomed-out versions of the platforming sections along with areas where you have to transition from one gameplay style to the next in rapid succession.The Mario-style platformer has a different physics setup than the action-platformer, while the Pac-style sections and shooters control about as you would expect them to. Each gameplay style takes up its own dimension, and the key gimmick here is that each dimension can be playable at any time. Zoomed-out areas are also fairly plentiful, and are harder to control since the characters are so small and its hard to tell where they are in relation to the world. There are also sections where youll have to jump using the action-platformer physics into a Mario-style section, with proper execution allowing you to progress and failure resulting in a quick restart. Checkpoints are plentiful, and are a fantastic anti-frustration feature. However, while the sub-genres work about how you would want them to, there are some control problems that hurt them from time to time.In the case of the head-bopping platformer, running never quite feels fast enough. In the action-platformer, aiming your blade works but isnt smooth, and the Strider-influenced gameplay is a bit clunky. Shoot-em-up portions are slow-paced, while the Pac-Man portions have an odd control delay from time to time that will result in some needless deaths. The execution of the gameplay styles is done well overall, but some patching of the controls would really be helpful because they dont feel as tight as they should be. It takes a game that would be an absolute must-buy if everything worked as it should into something that is a bit harder to recommend. Its a shame too since its very clear that the devs love the genres they used in the game, but they just couldnt quite make something that can holds its own with the leaders of their respective genres. Its a highly-ambitious project with a reach that exceeds its grasp.Each sub-section has some fun stuff in it that is unique, such as the shooter sections having objects go from one dimension to the other and turn into something else each time  including when youve got a giant laser beam bearing down on you. The Pac-Man portions arent just about chomping things though, as you need to do it in a particular order to unlock gates. Doing so properly gets you some extra gem shards that count towards your completion and net you a higher rating. Youve also got a goal time to beat for each level, so if time attacks are your thing, youll enjoy this game a lot. Concursion is designed around replayability, and both speed and gem counts provide reasons to come back for more.Visually, Concursion looks a less lively Cloudberry Kingdom. The visual style is reminiscent of a Flash cartoon brought to life, but with low-grade animation that hurts the presentation. Action-based attacks only have a few frames of animation, while the head-bopping platforming portions have slightly more. The shooting and jetpack sections are fairly smooth, while the Pac-ish portions look like they should. Concursion isnt exactly an ugly game, but isnt the most pleasing to look at either.The sound design of Concursion is its most impressive part beyond the multi-genre gameplay integration. The chiptune soundtrack is enjoyable and comes from the composer behind House M.D., which is kind of amazing. The music is fairly catchy and hummable in the game, but not something thats likely going to stick with you after playing it. The sound effect work is quite impressive as a whole. The aforementioned laser beam sound is haunting, and gives you a quick clue as to when to move out of the way and avoid damage. A low humming sound also clues you into gem shard locations, making them easier to find than they otherwise would be. Concursions audio succeeds in just about every major way, and makes playing through the game more enjoyable than it otherwise would be.Closing Comments:", "date": "August 9, 2014", "grade": 3.0}
