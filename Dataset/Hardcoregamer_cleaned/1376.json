The journey through this retro throwback platformer brings out so many differing reactions that can be a source of amusement for the specialized team of behaviorists that are observing me for research (everybody has those, right?). A typical play session consists of mutterings along the line of I hate this. I hate this. I hateOh, look! Im riding a pterodactyl! Sweet!The reason for this stems from a peculiar control quirk. This is a retro styled platform in every sense, and missing a jump can spell instant death. There are also segments that involve going down through a platform. Instead of pressing down and jump at the same time, which is the accepted standard, players just press down. When using a controller, as every human being should do when playing a retro platformer, the game has a tendency to read any slight tick towards down as You heard him, boys. He wants to see the spiky vines up close! Dump him! The game also has an issue with its platforms as well. If they are not landed on just right, they they become corporeal, leading to a miss. These issues prevent this one man project from achieving the lofty heights that the obvious love and care poured into it deserves.It really shows the care, too. This platformer is not content being a rote genre entry. It pilfers and tweaks so many design elements from other classics, keeping variety to the fore. Spears can be thrown into walls to create makeshift platforms, similar to Quackshot on the Genesis. Bones can be thrown in an arc like the axes in Castlevania. The titular caveman can double-jump, air dash, and attack with the best of them. All of these skills will need to be utilized in various combinations to progress. This variety comes through in some well crafted levels. Each level is packed with ways to go off the beaten track. Secrets abound through fake walls and backtracking after climbing or falling. Many levels also have more than one path through. It might be that a certain part at ground level is very challenging. Through creative use of the tools provided, though, this part can be bypassed. Experimentation is encouraged, as death isnt a horrific setback. While the stages do not have mid-level check points, the player is provided with unlimited lives. Restarting is instantaneous; players will watch the caveman explode in a shower of bones and guts and be able to immediately start again. While this can be frustrating for folks at the end of the stage, it isnt a deal breaker. Each stage is about half the length of one from the original Super Mario, so catching up to the challenge that dealt defeat previously is a brief affair. Still, there were certain stages that start off difficult, and the only reason for defeat later was due to either trial and error or the control issues. In the end though, they felt well balanced.If one were to liken There Was A Caveman to a meal, then the primary levels are the vegetables. Some taste great while others simply need to be finished so that dessert will be served. And the boss fights are so, so sweet. Each of these encounters feature a well drawn large creature to battle and out-wit. These leviathans all have their own well designed quirks and weaknesses that are well thought out. There never seemed to be any control issues that can be found in the levels during these scuffles. They also have had the most detail put into them, appearance-wise. Learning the patterns and chipping away at the heath bars are where this title truly shines. Regarding the look of the game, it can be said that it doesnt present itself as well as some of its contemporaries in the neu-retro space. Nobody will confuse it with the second coming of Shovel Knight or the sublime Rogue Legacy. The caveman himself has a look from somewhere between the Atari 2600 and the NES. The levels and enemies range between bland to passable. This is, of course, with the exception of the bosses, which were very well drawn.Finally, the music really does capture the sound of an 8-bit powerhouse. One could be forgiven for thinking that it was ripped from an old cart and placed here. An old cart with bad music. Regrettably, the chip tunes here are more on the droning side of things. It is clear that attempts were made to match the feel of the music with the stages themselves, but it ends up feeling like a beeping-booping amorphous blob of aural nonsense. Closing Comments:While one wants to be honest when reviewing a title, it feels a tad mean-spirited tearing into There Was A Caveman. So much love and care went into crafting this title and it shows. The developer is continuing to make good faith improvements to the adventure. During the time between the review copy was received and this writing, a hotfix was issued that addressed numerous other complaints that would have made their way here and few that were not even noticed (jumping from vine to vine saw massive improvement for one). This leads one to hope that Auris Amatnieks will tune up some of the other issues to make this the game it was meant to be. At the moment of this writing, There Was A Caveman can be recommended for fans of nostalgia laden platformers, but there are some major caveats. With a little luck, these will be fixed, because I really wanted to end this review advising folks to Open the door. Get on the floor.
