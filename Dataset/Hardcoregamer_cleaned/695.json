{"name": "Bounce", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=237696", "text": "With consumer grade virtual reality in its infancy, there has been a heavy focus on certain experiences that have already been shown to work. Space shooters, gun galleries and mini-game collections of varying quality are the glut of what is available. Even the titles that try to do something different tend to be on the more simple side of things. This is where Steel Wool Studios Vive exclusive title, Bounce, lands.The concept of the title is extremely basic. There is a robot sphere, who I have dubbed Adoraball (real name D1G-B), who is trying to escape a space ship. Its up to the player to guide him. At a press of the pad on the right controller, he pops out of a spot on the map, and must roll to the destination hole. The player uses planks, curved pipes, circular launchers, and speed pads to create the path. Once Adoraball is launched, there is no guiding him. Should he crash, pressing the same button recalls him so adjustments can be made.In actuality, the entire game reminds me of a cold winters day I spent with my plumber uncle on a job when I was young. The house was already built, and the owner refused drilling. So, we were in the basement as he worked to connect one point to the next, keeping the piping as unobtrusive as possible while following all of the correct codes. His high standing in the union showed that he knew what he was doing, but he also pretended to ask me for advise as a teaching method, and paid me $100 afterwards. In the end, I had a great time and didnt realize everything I had learned about spatial reasoning until reflecting upon the day at a later date. The point to this entire experience is that there is an actual educational value to this game. This is a game that employs critical thinking, exercising the brain muscles of all ages. Numerous obstructions will appear throughout the fifty levels that Adoraball must be guided around. Rings will show up that require the sphere to pass through before the exit is available. Fortunately, the tools for the job are always available with a click of the left controller wand pad. The motion based controls are exceptionally simple to manipulate. The left pad allows for cycling through the available items that can be materialized. The pieces can then be turned and placed anywhere in three dimensions, with the item left hanging in the air when done. Should the wrong item be selected, or if the player simply wants to clean up the play field, the item can be picked up with the right controller and placed on top of the left, where the item will then warp to the ethereal storage place. Moving around is done using the tried and true teleportation system with the trigger on the left wand.One descriptor of this game that can cause consternation is the fact that its marketing material describes Bounce as physics based. Typically, that is shorthand for things will be messed up and thats wacky. Fortunately, that is not the case here. D1G-B will roll the same way every time he is dropped if no changes are made, lending much needed predictability to the puzzle solving. A brightly colored line will show the path that the last failed attempt took, allowing for small adjustments to a winning idea to be made. This removes much of the frustration that would be inherent in a title like this. That removal works for more than just making minor adjustments to an obvious solution. It also frees the player up to engage in less conventional solutions. At the beginning, I didnt like this game, as I felt that the tools were there for the bog standard solution. I put the game down out of boredom, thinking that I would come back to it later. As I thought about it, I realized that there was nothing stating that the obvious solution was the correct one. Going back in, my runs highlighted heavy use of the treadmills and speed boosting circles, making Adoraball a daredevil specializing in midair shenanigans. The stupider and more convoluted I could make the path, the more I enjoyed myself. The post level grading system thought that I could have been a bit more efficient, though.The biggest criticism to be leveled at this game falls to the music. Going with the synth/trance style, this music is distractingly annoying, the audio equivalent of water torture. Its barely there but its repetitive and droning, on and on until feelings of violence and mayhem consume the player. Formless and pointless, this stuff is just obnoxious. These criticisms do come from someone who does enjoy spacing out to the genre from time to time, clearing the mind and allowing the music to buffet the thoughts in a strange sort of meditation. So, maybe skip downloading the soundtrack separately. Closing Comments:While the game concept and interaction methods are simple, Bounce has some heft to it. Fifty discrete levels that can be solved in ridiculous ways gives it quite a bit of staying power. The only limit is how over the top the player wants to be with the tools on hand. Anyone looking for a solid puzzler in VR will have a great time with Bounce.", "date": "Bohn on December 1, 2016", "grade": 4.0}
