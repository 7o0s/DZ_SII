{"name": "Ride to Hell: Retribution", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=46084", "text": "Being a critic can sometimes lead to an odd juxtaposition of games. While your average gamer may play Tomb Raider and naturally progress to BioShock Infinite, I had the privilege of playing The Last of Us before transitioning intoRide to Hell: Retribution. Thats not to say that Im holding it against the title by unfairly comparing it; The Last of Us was a special experience thats rarely obtained in the medium. Instead, I at best had hope for a strange so bad its good experience along the lines of Deadly Premonition. But not only did Ride to Hell turn out to hardly be playable, but a dying relic of a time where uninformed gamers could be bilked out of a quick buck from a studio desperate to salvage whatever financial gain possible from a failed project.The odd thing about Ride to Hell is that it starts off with a glimmer of hope that it might actually be a good game. The main menu has a nice pulpy look to it as it blares Rival Sons Pressure and Time and the intro has you firing a gatling gun at a bunch of enemies before moving on to a quick time fight and a title card. It seems to signal that the game isnt looking to take itself seriously, but instead trying to offer ridiculous fun in the vein of a modern-day grindhouse flick. Unfortunately, this hope is short lived until the second a character opens their mouth and you take your first roll forward on a motorcycle. In actuality, its a horrendous mess that thinks its a decent game. Instead of more licensed southern rock, were treated to some awful, generic instrumental rock tunes that range from bad 90s grunge to bad 70s country rock (even though the game takes place in the late 60s). Instead of ridiculous gameplay, were presented with some of the worst in recent memory. Its quite possible that the majority of the games budget was spent on securing the Rival Sons song, which also explains why its constantly touted in press releases, plays on the official website and appears no less than three times throughout the game. Ride to Hell works like this: ride a motorcycle to a destination, meet a NPC and get into a fight, ride to another NPC, get into an excruciatingly long firefight, ride back to town. Lather, rinse, repeat. The town serves as the central hub where you can choose your next mission, buy guns and sell drugs. Thats it  its a nearly-abandoned old west town with random cars and shacks strewn throughout that cant be entered and a few non-interactive NPCs. Hell, there arent even invisible walls. If you venture out of the main area, a prompt appears that warns you to turn back before automatically resetting you back on the edge. Its akin to a horrible purgatory or some other frighting Twilight Zone set-up. And in case you thought the whole selling drugs thing was a typo, bags of drugs (which look like cocaine) can be picked up from slain enemies and sold to a hippy in the back of a VW Microbus. The drugs have names like Color Crunch, Frosties, Gravity, Exhaust and Desert Grains and do nothing but give you money. This mechanic doesnt personally offend me, but it seems borderline irresponsible to make such a controversial act a throwaway mechanic for a quick way to gain moneyto buy guns.Great franchises like Road Rash and MotoGP have proved time and time again that motorcycles make for solid gameplay, so youd think an unabashed biker game would at least be able to feature some fun on a hog, but the horrendous steering mechanics make quick work of that possibility. Motorcycles are incredibly floaty, sometimes barely appearing to touch the ground, controlled only with the analog stick and left/right triggers to break and accelerate. No drifting, no finesse in the response whatsoever  just holding a button and trying not to move the analog stick too much. Alright, maybe thats not exactly true  hitting the Y button also allows you to powerslide, quickly recovering after skidding under a semi or other hazard. Its not a game rooted in reality, or even video game reality for that matter, instead creating its own horrible reality where motorcycles are like potatoes. Worse yet, the tracks are boring and repetitive desert highways where theres a million jumps in the easement and the same exact vehicles always barreling down them. The developers didnt even get the speed right, as the game inexplicably goes into slow motion mode any time a rival rider pulls besides you and tries to attack  fended off simply by pressing a prompted button. Alas, besides gunplay, practically all other action is handled with quick time events. Hand-to-hand combat consists of hitting A to punch, X to kick or break blocks and Y to block, which makes it an exercise in button mashing. Every so often, a random face button has to be hit to avoid an attack and a finishing move can sometimes be triggered. The finishing move consists of more QTEs and is completely useless as its much more complicated than the one last punch the enemy would have needed to be defeated. In-battle animation is dreadful, with your character literally floating between characters with no real use of physics. Gunplay fares no better, with some of the worst aiming Ive ever encountered. I had to frequently replay scenarios simply because it was too hard to keep the reticle near the enemy.While the cel-shaded-esque graphic style is fine, everything else is glitchy beyond belief. The visuals are prone to constant screen tearing and character animations rarely render correctly, often switching back and forth between detailed and a glob of play-doh. The mouths of the characters move strangely, making them look like gaping wholes that arent syncing up with the voice acting. Thats probably for the best, however, as Ride to Hell features some of the worst voiceovers in a modern game. Its hard to put into words how bad it sounds, but it seems like one man and women did all the voices, poorly imitating various accents. Theres glitches abound, such as a crucial weapon not rendering after its first appearance, enemies flying around like rag-dolls after being shot and randomly running into walls repeatedly. To make everything just a bit worse, theres frequent long loading times in between practically any scenery change, which happen quite often.Closing Comments:", "date": "June 26, 2013", "grade": 1.0}
