You either go all in, taking upwards of a year to create material for a game thats gradually losing its userbase, or you release frequent chunks over a couple of months to keep fans interested. If you look at the first Dark Souls, Artorias of the Abyss had a lot to offer for a reasonably price, but was released almost a year after the vanilla game hit store shelves. FromSoftware then went on to change their strategy by doing three pieces of DLC for Dark Souls II, Crown of the Sunken King, Old Iron King, and Ivory King, spread out across three months. It was a good strategy that kept players coming back for more, varying things up nicely, even though they were short in comparison. After six months on the market, Dark Souls III is finally getting its first downloadable content, bringing us to a new, but familiar setting. We travel the Painted World of Ariandel where youll not only battle the frigid weather, but larger and rather threatening enemies. Can this throwback to the Painted World of Ariamis meet Dark Souls IIIs high standards, or was this made purely for nostalgic purposes?The biggest disappointment with Ashes of Ariandel right off the bat is its length. Its arguably the shortest DLC released for a Dark Souls game, taking us roughly 3 hours to complete, and then an extra hour to gather all the items and explore. Now granted, theres a decent variety when it comes to areas as you start in a rather intimidating snowy valley, and then move your way through a village, a cliffside and finally an all too familiar cathedral. The biggest issue is that youll get the feeling like the Painted World isnt as expanded as it could be. The village, if you can call it that, only has a couple of houses, and the cliffside shortcuts are relatively close to one another, meaning youll be bypassing very little. Even the cathedral, which seems massive from the outside, is surprisingly small, with one area upon entering, an insignificant attic, and an open crypt that houses the worlds largest collection of maggot filled flies. There is a side path similar to that of The Great Hollow from the first Dark Souls, just far shorter with more of an emphasis on platforming and less on enemy encounters. It may be a larger Painted World than weve become accustomed to, but its shallower with far fewer exploration opportunities.For such a short piece of downloadable content, its surprising how many new and unique enemies have been crammed in. In the first area alone, you go through the standard soldier class that constantly overwhelms you, then it moves to Ents that can either breathe frost or shoot small balls of fire at you, then packs of territorial wolves, and finally large Nordic Viking with a varied arsenal. Wolves had the opportunity to be some of the best enemies to fight, but unfortunately they end up being just larger versions of dogs with essentially the same move set. The next area, the village, has what looks like baby birds crawling and bumbling around everywhere, doing little damage outside of the ones that spew toxic sludge. I think theyre meant to be interpreted as prepubescent Crow Demons from the Painted World of Ariamis as theres flocks of them that are there to be cut down by you, or the next enemy were about to talk about.Easily the best, and at the same time worst enemy is the lanky creature wielding crow talons (essentially wider ranged claws). There are a few of them scattered throughout the small village area and as soon as you see one, youll be running in the opposite direction. Not only are they incredibly fast, but they take wide swings and refuse to slow down until youre dead. Taking on one at a time can be a challenge, but fighting two will causing nothing but frantic panic. The final enemy is arguably the most annoying only because there are so many of them stuck in a disgustingly dark pit. These fly creatures spew maggots down your throat (literally if they grab you), causing a similar effect as those Corpse-Grubs in the Cathedral of the Deep. They may be primarily isolated in one area, but they certainly are an entertaining pain to deal with, especially with such a ruthless hitbox aiding their grabs. Theres also an ice variant of the giant crabs, but theyre nothing more than what weve come to expect.This wouldnt be Dark Souls without the inclusion of strategic and increasingly difficult bosses, and Ashes of Ariandel more or less delivers. There are two new additions, if you dont count the mini-boss halfway through, and while both are fascinating from a visual aesthetic, only one of them leaves a memorable mark from a design perspective. The less than appealing boss puts you up against a Champion who has befriended wolves. The problem with this fight is that the main individual youre facing is far too easy to take down. He wields a short sword and a rather majestic shield that can break through any guard. Halfway through, a wolf as large as Sif arrives to aid the Champion, but even its fairly predictable in its movements and attacks. It almost mirrors Vordt of the Boreal Valley, charging at you full speed three times before breathing ice across the field. Its a shame the smaller wolves dont respawn as they would have added a level of annoyance that could have made this fight a little more challenging. Its an absolutely gorgeous arena you get to fight in, but the boss itself leaves much to desire.Sister Friede is the final boss and her fight is a fantastic addition. First off, she resembles that of Crossbreed Priscilla, wielding a large scythe and can go invisible for set periods of time, although Friede is significantly more agile. More importantly, Friede is basically three bosses wrapped into one as youll have to fight her as a standard opponent, then with a rather chaotic secondary enemy rampaging around, and finally once more while shes buffed with dark magic. The first stage is more or less a short duel, whereas the second part of the fight can be highly entertaining if you go in solo, but thats really most multi-boss fights. The third act is where things shine as it relies on timing, skill, and most importantly patience, something Dark Souls is all about. It becomes even more difficult to time her attacks as her combos are incredibly lengthy, and she rarely lets up. Having a second ally in there will help draw aggro, but the one NPC supplied will go down fairly fast. Now, as great as this battle may be, its conclusion feels astonishingly anti-climactic. Mind you, this is a short piece of content that just throws you into the thick of things right from the get-go, but the battle is fairly challenging and at the end Friede just collapses and that its. You can exchange her soul for one of two weapons, but there is no grand finale or even any meaningful dialogue from the few new NPCs, which is kind of disappointing.Closing Comments:Dark Souls III: Ashes of Ariandel is a short but sweet experience. It contains at least one boss that holds its own in a universe packed with memorable clashes, and a rather appealing setting that will bring upon nostalgia for a game that was only released five years ago. There are even some fantastic new weapons and spells to collect, along with the PVP arena making a grand return. Unfortunately, Ashes of Ariandel isnt without its problems. As mentioned before, this is a short package that takes roughly three hours to complete with a couple of off the beaten paths to explore. The world itself feels underdeveloped, with the town setting may as well being a semi-large farm, and the cliffside having shortcuts relatively close to one another. There are some terrific new enemies, such as the Nordic Vikings and the frostbitten Ents, but the wolves are repackaged dogs and the random crabs are exactly the same, just with an ice element. Despite its issues, Ashes of Ariandel is still worthy of any Dark Souls III player as its more of what weve come to love, with a couple of nods for long time fans.", "date": "October 20, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
