{"name": "Alien Breed", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=29238", "text": "Long ago in an ancient past when Commodore blessed its followers with the glory of the Amiga, Team 17 released an overhead-view corridor shooter called Alien Breed, and it was good. It was also an art design tweak away from being a direct copyright infringement on the movie Aliens, but media companies tended to be a bit less litigious in the early 90s, so that was ok. There was a space station crawling with almost-H.R. Giger aliens, desperately in need of extermination in a pure arcade style, and the space marines were happy to do the job. 20 years and several sequels later and the original Alien Breed has a shiny new HD update, showing off a style thats maybe a bit simple by todays standards, but also the equivalent of video game comfort food.By simple I mean run through corridors, shoot things, reach objective, race level-destruct timer to exit. Its not a complicated game by any stretch of the imagination, nor even particularly difficult. Theres plenty of ammo to go around, and if you run out of keys you can shoot locked doors open. Aliens go down in a couple of hits, and even the boss creatures are big rather than actually dangerous. Death generally comes from carelessness handling enemies, accidentally running through an electric barrier, or not paying attention to the occasional trap hole opening up beneath your feet. Run low on lives and the Store is a pause-button away.There have only been a few changes to Alien Breed in the updated version, and one of the major ones is the store. Originally it was found at computer consoles scattered throughout the levels, but now its accessed by a quick tap of the pause button. You can buy everything from ammo to level maps to lives here, using the cash picked up throughout the labyrinthine levels many rooms. Most of the money will be spent on new weapons, though, because while the initial rapid-fire gun is nice enough, its hard to understate the joys of a flamethrower or bouncy-laser.Once youve bought a gun, youve got it forever. Any purchase you make carries over into all gameplay modes, so if you like scattering missiles down the space stations corridors you wont have to keep re-buying that ability. Oddly enough, lives and ammo carry over too, so if you complete a gaming session with a single life left, the next time you start youll only have the one available. On the plus side, ammo carrying over between games means youll never run out after a couple hours play, easily maxing the ammo clip counter out at 99. This even holds true for the HD and Classic versions of the game.Alien Breed is divided up in a couple of ways. The default version is an enhanced HD upgrade, with sharp new graphics and a nice twin-stick control method. For purists, however, the original look is available complete with the single-stick method of aiming. Both Enhanced and Classic modes have the full set of levels available, which is divided among the original six-level game, the 12 level Alien Breed Enhanced, and a handful of four to six level expansion packs. Its a lot of levels to run through, but despite the volume of content, youll still be shooting the same three monsters over and over again.Closing Comments:", "date": "February 11, 2013", "grade": 3.5}
