{"name": "Heros Sage Laevatein Tactics", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=33797", "text": "The DS has played host to many great SRPGs like Disgaea DS and Final Fantasy Tactics: A2. Now, Aksys has added Heros Saga to the systems roster of well-crafted entries in the genre. While I wouldnt put it on top of that list, it does a lot of things right and largely provides a satisfying experience despite some shortcomings.One problem is that Heros Saga plays like most SRPGs on the market with few exceptions. Its you and your troops versus a main rival and his/her troops in grid-based warfare, and like many genre entries, it has an incredibly steep learning curve. However, it does help separate itself from the pack with things like a unique class system. Instead of a traditional class system where class changes with the characters level, here, characters change class with their weapons. I dont recall seeing this before, and it actually works pretty well. Theres also an item trading feature available if you know anyone else who has the game. Beyond that, the gameplay is very DS-centric, which helps the game feel like something optimized for the platform. Battles begin on the bottom screen, where a bare minimum of characters are shown until you select whether to attack or defend, at which point the gameplay shifts to the top screen where a more-detailed viewpoint of the combat is shown. With it, youre able to see each troop one side at a time and plan accordingly. If your main rival has a lot of underlings, you can choose to either attack them first and hope to wipe them out  thus allowing you to focus on the leader, or focus on the leader and hope that the secondary enemies dont wind up doing too much damage.At that point, the bottom screen is used to select whether youd like to attack, how youd like to attack, if youd like to defend, and so on. This can be done with either the d-pad or the stylus, and works pretty well from a functional standpoint, as it is easier to select the options on the larger menu screen, but the shift from top to bottom-screen combat is pretty jarring, especially given the change in detail levels. I also found that using the d-pad instead of the stylus took less time, so the touch screen usage was logical, but still not quite ideal.Heros Sagas plot is perfectly acceptable fare, but isnt terribly compelling. The hero Ernesto is given an incredibly powerful sword that is part of the highly sought after Vaettir Arms. Now, he must join together with allies to stop the evil Empire from getting his sword and conquering his nation. The storyline, like most SRPGs, is largely forgettable. Thats been one major drawback to these games  the focus is on the gameplay and the stories wind up being secondary unless theyre huge releases like the original Final Fantasy Tactics, or are so over the top that they cant help but be memorable like Disgaea.Graphically, Heros Saga is pretty impressive given its genre and system. While the bottom screen combat looks like a GBA-level SPRG, it becomes much sharper-looking when things go to the top screen. Everything just flat out looks better  the environments have depth, you can actually see facial expressions and the intricacies of each designs  including being able to tell each individual part of a characters armor or clothing. The only negative to the graphics here is that the animation isnt all that detailed. The top screen is also used to completely show whatever storyline is being told with full-screen art that is quite gorgeous. This is another element that takes advantage of the two screen format because in a normal SPRG, a lot of this art would likely be covered up by text  hurting the players ability to enjoy the art.Heros Sagas musical score is stirring, but not altogether memorable. The tunes all fit the medieval theme of the game, but dont stand out much. They are, however, good songs in their own right  just dont expect to have much of a desire to listen to them after playing the game. The sound effect work is fine  everything sounds correct, nothing seems out of place, but they, like the music, arent exceptional. Closing Comments:", "date": "October 20, 2009", "grade": 3.5}
