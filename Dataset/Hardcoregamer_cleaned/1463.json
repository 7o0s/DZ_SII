{"name": "Everybodys Gone to the Rapture", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=162906", "text": "The answers are all here. The answers are in the light.How did you react to that line? Did the ambiguity intrigue you, the mystery of what it could mean that the answers are in the light, or did it just not phase you at all? Its an important distinction to make now, because if youre the latter type, you might not get a lot out of Everybodys Gone to the Rapture. But if youre the type who loves to soak in a good story, pore over every clue and poke your nose into every nook and cranny in search of some greater understanding, then youll find Rapture to be a poignant and tenebrously beautiful experience that rewards your thoroughness and devotion. Its a flawed game for sure, sometimes maddeningly so, but the bright spots amongst the darkness here are usually just good enough to be worth the trudge.Everybodys Gone to the Rapture plays out a lot like HBOs The Leftovers meets Gone Home. Youre an unknown figure left wandering the empty streets of Shropshire, a sleepy English town where everyone has vanished mysteriously. Theres a glowing orb that will lead you around to reenact the last vestiges of life in town. Golden flecks animate each scene like bright shadow puppets. Of course, even a quiet town like Shropshire has its fair share of drama going on, and youll learn about the townspeoples secret affairs, resentments, xenophobia and tragic losses over the course of the game, much of which has nothing to do with their disappearance. The smart writing and fantastic voice acting from the entire cast does an excellent job making each character feel real and alive, even in their last moments, and some of the more tragic storylines are genuinely affecting as a result. While much of the games story is derivative of other works, borrowing generously from The Leftovers and a dash of LOST, its undeniably clumsier in execution, but still does an admirable job. I wouldnt necessarily call the conclusion satisfying, but it was interesting, at least, especially in retrospect.Its unfortunate that a few bullish artistic decisions cripple the game in several ways, though. The oft-criticized slow movement speed is indeed just as bothersome as youd expect when youre moving across large fields or through dense forests and your only option is to trudge along. The run button hardly qualifies as thatmore of a faster walk button, if anything. Rapture starts to feel like a game designed with contempt for the player in mind, like developer The Chinese Room couldnt trust players to appreciate its story and setting well enough unless it forced them to crawl through it. Of course, you could say that Rapture really isnt a game that needs a run button because it is indeed meant to be taken slowly and theres nothing to run to. You could even say that its not a problem of the movement speed, but that the density of story events is too low in relation to the size of the explorable area. Regardless, Rapture is simultaneously a game that wants players to dig through every detail and one that forces players to walk slowly, and that doesnt work. Its incredibly discouraging to your sense of exploration when you know itll take ages to get back to the building with the thing inside, or over the bridge to those gardens with the stuff lying around. Especially when youre not guaranteed a reward for each time you leave the beaten path, the slow movement speed isnt just a problem; its the reason most players will stick to the main thread or just quit altogether. By the end of the game, Id completely lost any desire to explore and barreled my way to the ending.The other big problem with Rapture is that it runs surprisingly poorly. Theres constant hitching (especially while turning), dropped frames and consistent moments where the audio stutters or cuts out. Whenever you watch the golden flecks reenact a scene, the game will shift quickly from day to night, and then back again once the scene is over; its a neat effect, but the game cant handle it and starts chunking up immediately. Its a shame because the game looks and sounds beautiful when its not hitching. The textures arent the highest fidelity, but theres some great lighting and nice touches like changing shadows on the ground from the clouds (even though the sky above doesnt change). The game pairs the serenity of the peaceful village with an excellent soundtrack, full of sweeping overtures and church choir singing, that enhances the games vibe rather than distracting from it.Closing Comments:Its a shame that Everybodys Gone to the Rapture falls for the trap of slowing players down to force engagement because it does the exact opposite. Theres plenty to latch onto here, but the slow movement speed and technical problems distract from the otherwise moving story. Rapture couldve used a more definitive conclusion, or maybe a few more illuminating hints sprinkled along the path to the ending, but still, its the individual character moments that will stick with you.", "date": "August 16, 2015", "grade": 3.5}
