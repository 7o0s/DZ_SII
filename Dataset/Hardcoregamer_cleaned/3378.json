{"name": "Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=440446", "text": "The year was 2001 and an all-time great console had just released to a hungry market. The Game Boy Advance was poised to set new records after the Game Boy Color boomed for a decade after introduction. Featuring a bigger screen size, extended battery life and enhanced picture resolution, it would be an exciting time to see what new games would grace the handheld scene. For fans of tactical gameplay, a new title appeared on the horizon that would pave the way for turn-based strategy titles. Originally developed as Famicom Wars, Advance Wars brought fun, bite-sized strategy to Western audiences that would also lead to the release of big hits like Fire Emblem later on. Both Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising featured robust strategy systems that felt like chess on steroids. It was meant to be a perfect blend of simplicity and complexity that was easy to learn, but difficult to master. A huge concern that Nintendo and Intelligent Systems had at the time was the possibility of overly-complex gameplay design. Much of this, however, was addressed by the way in-depth tutorials within the game guided players without needing to read a manual.With its approachable gameplay and vibrant design, Advance Wars became a staple for the Game Boy Advance. Now the title is back, fifteen years after its last release (since Days of Ruin on Nintendo DS) and refreshes the first two entries for a new generation. With gameplay staying consistent since its original launch, Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp is a perfect way to get into the series for the first time, or refresh skills that may have been on the shelf for the last decade. For the newly enlisted, the turn-based battle system plays out over days in-game. Players select a Commanding Officer and take turns strategizing and building. With a variety of different units to play with, there are many win combinations at your disposal. Infantry, planes, subs and more pepper the map as moves are planned. With each unit having limited move sets, it does become a layered game of chess to reach objectives while also considering terrain bonuses and CO powers for extra support. Infantry can capture buildings for points or resources which adds extra layers of strategic play  especially since they offer refuels and health for units if theyre low. Some quality-of-life improvements streamline gameplay for quicker action and the titles feature a lot of replay value thanks to War Room and Design Room modes available if players want a break from the main campaign. This reboot features easy and classic modes for variable difficulty. Playing with classic yields the most challenge, but even then the campaigns can take about fifteen hours to complete each. But the joy of Advance Wars is the variety it gives. Some quality-of-life improvements streamline gameplay for quicker action, and the titles feature a lot of replay value thanks to War Room and Design Room modes available if players want a break from the main campaign  or more content. Updated visuals give the title a fresh coat of paint with enjoyable voice acting and new animations. Despite some of the newer features missing the mark in certain ways, Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp still captures the essence of its original release for new recruits and veterans alike.Advance Wars doesnt miss a colorful beat as the game opens to fresh animation featuring our main protagonists Max, Andy, Sami and Nell. Following these Commanding Officers (COs) through the campaign tells us the tale of the Orange Star nation as they fight valiantly to stave off enemy invasions. From behind the scenes, we eventually learn that so much of this campaign of warring nations has actually been fabricated. With other nations believing Orange Star to be the main antagonist, conflicts brew as a true mastermind pulls the strings of war so that these nations do not unite. The beauty of this dual package is that players dont need to wait to see how these events turn out, as Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising continues the story from where we left off. With overhauled designs and vibrant aesthetic, this reboot still carries the charm of a Nintendo classic. In this new collection, were treated to voice acting for additional immersive value, and animations for each COs special abilities. These visuals fit nicely on the Switch in either handheld or TV modes. Even aesthetic choices like music compliment each CO as well as unique fanfares play when a CO uses their power. Another major visual change seen from one generation of Advance Wars to the next is the use of updated unit designs. Where the original version featured sprite units moving across the map, Re-Boot Camp takes a different approach that seems to simulate toys in a sandbox. Unit designs are shiny and look like plastic toys; if we notice the board it appears to have taken on a sandbox or board game feel. Im suddenly transported to my childhood days of playing with Army men in the backyard. While this doesnt necessarily detract from gameplay, it feels like this new design changes the tone of Advance Wars to be more youngster-friendly. With the title being for everyone, this art direction feels like a choice to be more inclusive (especially since this title and its original had to tiptoe around releasing during active wartime conflict around the globe). With more animation and new design choices, its clear the title prides itself wanting to give more nuance to its original cast. Yet despite the title playing seamlessly in both hand-held and TV modes, the graphics tend to stretch a bit on larger screens.Revamped visuals still make the game as pretty as ever, but additional gameplay updates have immensely helped its quality of life. An irritation in many turn-based strategy titles is how long it can take for actions to execute. Especially now with the integration of animations showing the exchange of fire (we also see this in Fire Emblem, for example). For those with freaky processing speeds that basically allow you to see into the future, it can feel like such an eternal drag when sitting there watching animations play out. The inclusion of a fast forward option in many contemporary strategy titles deserves a chefs kiss. You can now fast forward through troop movements and exchanges. It still remains unclear why youre not able to fast forward through CO animations, though. As pretty as they are, it throws off the groove when our playstyle is rapid fire and you suddenly need to pause every time we use their power. The campaign offers a way to play for all folks, however, with the introduction of a turn reset option as well. Maybe youre thinking too quickly and make a mistake. Perhaps newer players know what to expect after moving their units now. Regardless of the mistake, the turn reset is here to fix mistakes. Youre able to use this whenever we need, and it can provide a good safety net for players that are still learning. With so many different strategies available, and a variety of Commanding Officer bonuses, it can take some time for players to find their playstyle. This reboot sticks to its roots to make a classic title accessible and fun to everyone.As players hone their skills in campaign mode, theres a plethora of other content to enjoy if you want to take a break  or if youre itching to put our skills to the test. War Room gives levels to play with where any CO can be used, including ones unlocked with currency in Hachis Shop. This gives extra content to enjoy as you have fun as COs youve encountered. For the creative sandbox players, the Design Room offers the freedom to create and share maps with others. Any tools seen during campaign mode can be used to create your own maps. You can then share these online, or locally, with other players. Its basically Super Mario Maker, but with way less jumping. You can continue the multiplayer fun in a variety of ways, which is a refreshing take on these original titles. *Ahem*, back in my day we had to use a link-cable. Or, if you had internet you could check out the web version that would refresh the page after every move  sometimes resulting in actual days of play. It brings a truly masterful classic to the modern age. But this expectation can also set you up for disappointment as online play is limited with its matchmaking and will only match with friends who are online. But local multiplayer is a joy and adds another amazing game to the roster of party games, if strategizing against friends is your version of a party (its mine). Closing Comments:Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp is a worthy remake of some of the best strategy titles around. Deserving renewed love, these Advance Wars titles bring rich layers of tactical gameplay to a new generation. Upgraded visuals are gorgeous and continue to reflect the games essence despite some design changes. Players can experience the campaigns at their own pace with varying degrees of difficulty, as well as the option to fast forward through play. Messing up is never fun, so a turn restart option has also been added to ease players into gameplay. From thinking about terrain bonuses, to picking a complimentary CO, players are asked to consider so many unique gameplay variables that add layers to the title. The fun doesnt have to stop with campaign completion either, as additional game modes and reward unlocks can keep the enjoyment going for hours. Despite aesthetic inconsistencies and online disappointments, WayForward and Nintendo deserve praise for bringing a solid classic to current generation play. Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp brings all the nostalgic feelings in a fresh, new package.", "date": "April 21, 2023", "grade": 4.0}
