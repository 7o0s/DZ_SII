{"name": "Robinson: The Journey (PSVR)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=235574", "text": "Things arent going well for a young boy named Robin at the start of Robinson: The Journey. He and his family were just a few of hundreds aboard a massive space ship named Esmeralda. However, on one fateful day everything went off the rails and the Esmeralda crash landed on planet Tyson III. While Robin was fortunate enough to survive via an escape pod, it seems no one else had similar luck. Now stuck on human-free Tyson III, Robin has lost all contact with his family and friends and can only hope that someone will eventually discover he had survived the crash and is in serious need of rescuing. It might sound like the worst circumstances imaginable, but Robin isnt entirely stranded alone as one of the ships AI  HIGS  also made it out. HIGS programming has shifted from its standard behavior to focus entirely on the well-being of Robin. As such, this floating orb robot becomes a bit of a parental figure for the boy. Then theres Laika, a young dinosaur which was abandoned after her mother was killed by a gigantic T-Rex. Despite being a deadly predator, at this young point in her life she is content to play games and explore with Robin, even though HIGS utterly detests this precarious friendship and does everything he can to dissuade Robin from keeping her as a pet. Of course, even HIGS best attempt at parenting cant keep Robin within the safety of his escape pod forever. After waiting for help to no avail, our protagonist decides its time to venture forth beyond the safety of this home base into more dangerous territory. What results is a journey through lush environments, encounters with massive dinosaurs, and puzzles that must be solved to discern what exactly happened to cause the Esmeraldas crash. Gameplay itself is presented as a first person adventure/exploration title with relatively simple puzzles and even a bit of stealth thrown into the mix late in the story. Anyone getting accustomed to their PlayStation VR headset may be surprised by the movement scheme as, instead of pointing and warping to a spot, youre actually given analog stick-based locomotion. Tilt the stick forward and youll simply walk ahead, rather than warping a few feet immediately as is the case with a fair number of other virtual reality titles.Some may find this motion initially problematic, especially if youve only played with a limited selection of PSVR titles thus far. Fortunately for most, the nauseating effect of fluid motion goes away after playing for a bit. Theres no option currently to swap to a warp motion method, though turning is handled by moving at designated angles to the left and right. In any case, once youve gotten a feel for locomotion, its time to explore Robinson: The Journey, and of all PSVR releases thus far, this one seems to create the most impressive environments. Locales are wide, spread out, and full of flora and fauna. Although the graphical fidelity within the headset isnt the best, coming face to face with gigantic dinosaurs still proves a powerful moment. Robinson: The Journey would have been just fine staying focused on the exploratory aspects, but it shoehorns in conventional gaming aspects such as solving puzzles, stealth, and platforming (in a sense) that dont add much to the experience. By platforming I dont mean jumping place to place but instead by being required to climb around locations on a regular basis. This was no doubt inspired by Cryteks other VR game, The Climb, but the climbing didnt work exceptionally well on Oculus Rift and the problems follow through here. You may find that Robins hands will continually fail to grab the correct object, so screwing up and missing a hand hold will happen often, and occasionally results in a game over state. Its only saved thanks to the frequent auto-save system.Closing Comments:Although not long by typical game standards, taking most explorers between four and eight hours, this is a serious amount of time for virtual reality releases. Adventuring around Tyson III is beautiful, and sometimes even breathtaking, and as such, it would have made more sense to focus on these high points instead of forcing players to drudge through puzzles or deal with sometimes finicky climbing mechanics. Even so, its incredibly appealing to visit the world of Robinson: The Journey within a VR headset. Barring that key aspect, it would be just another exploratory title with dinosaurs and adequate gameplay.", "date": "November 14, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
