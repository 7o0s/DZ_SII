{"name": "Symphony", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=11122", "text": "Shooters are a fairly common part of indie bundles, which makes getting one on its own a little harder to justify sometimes unless it has an immediate hook. Thankfully, Symphony has at least a couple of them. One comes in the form of the ability to use your own music library for the game, another is using mouse controls. The most important things it offers players comes from its addictive gameplay and fantastic default soundtrack that is nearly worth the cost of the game on its own.Symphony is a vertical shooter with a music-heavy twist. The game environment bears a slight resemblance to Guitar Hero/Rock Band-style rhythm games where youve got a limited part of the screen to actually use. Unlike a lot of shooters, however, you can move your ship around briskly due to the mouse controls. You can also customize what either the left or right buttons do, and combine both for some super-fast destruction of enemies. Like any shooter, youll want to avoid death, but here, you die and have to restart  just deal with a fairly massive point deduction. On lower difficulty levels, its not a big deal, but when you play on higher ones, the stakes are raised and you can see the amount of kudos earned for playing a level plummet due to a single careless mistake.In theory, the idea of having a shooter using your own music sounds a lot like Beat Hazard. However, while that series generated the tempo of the stage based on the music, Symphony doesnt, instead crafting completely unique stages for every song. Between the two of them, theres no real better option  theyre each great for their own reasons. Changing a levels pace based on the music is great, but I love always having to on in Symphony, and the strange juxtaposition between having a really slow-paced song playing, but not being able to relax due to the crazy stuff happening on-screen. Theres rarely a moment to rest. The occasional boss battles in stages are another draw. You never know when one will pop up, but when it first happens, prepare to be creeped out when the demonic overlord says ominous stuff while sending an underling to destroy you. Boss battles are challenging, becoming much harder when they come in later and later into the song  giving you less time to finish them off in the process.Outside of the players own music collection, Symphonys genre-spanning soundtrack is pretty awesome. Default tracks like Asymetric Mutation will bring a much faster pace than something slower like the piano-heavy Bokah Loop. Theres some great techno as well, some dubstep and even some awesome indie rock from Prettydead Ferrari. Its so good that I immediately put the included soundtrack on my MP3 player.The music syncing feature is fast and for the most part, really well-integrated. Finding a song to play is fairly easy if you dont have a huge collection  but if you have it splintered into a billion different folders like I do, you may find yourself spending a long time just going through your albums or artist listing. The best remedy for this is to just make a folder of stuff youd like to listen to with this game. Sure, itll probably cut down on happy accidents like playing a few runs with Fiona Apples cover of Frosty the Snowman blaring, but it will cut down on your in-game folder clutter.Symphony is stunning not only to hear, but look at as well. The overall color scheme for each level changes as your song goes on, and it results in smooth transitions from say a super-bright red to a slightly softer blue to then green and maybe some purple mixed in too. The screen is also full of life due to the many enemies, but theres no slowdown due to them or the color transition. Its also worth noting that the heavy almost-neon color scheme never gets so bright as to become distracting. The colors pop out of the screen and help give the game life during those few moments when that isnt provided by enemies swarming all around you.Closing Comments:At $10, Symphony is an easy recommendation given all you get with the GOG bundle. Its a unique and fun shooter boasting a far more vibrant color palette and better default soundtrack than Beat Hazard. Vertical shooter fans will adore it, as will those with extensive music collections. Theres just something so appealing about playing a game that gives you so much control over something so important to gaming  the music, and it makes the experience far more personal and enjoyable.", "date": "August 14, 2012", "grade": 4.0}
