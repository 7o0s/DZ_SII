{"name": "UFO Dad (PS Vita)", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=66957", "text": "UFO Dad is a pleasant little surprise on the PlayStation Mobile marketplace. Starring a paunchy, balding burger-meister, its easy to imagine the title character of Bobs Burgers behind this (and that actually wouldnt be a bad idea for an offically-licensed Bobs Burger game), who has created a magic spatula and is being hunted by aliens because why not? In order to prevent being captured by aliens and almost-certainly probed for knowledge, youll have to play a match-three game that blends a traditional puzzle game with some platforming ala Wario Woods. Instead of rotating the pieces with a cursor, you move whichever character youre playing as around the map.Using the d-pad and square, youll flip a burger in a particular direction unless its against a wall  then your only option is to flip it up and hope it collides with a like-colored burger to form a chain. The bigger the chain, the better youll do  especially if you then daisy-chain another color onto another set of like-colored burgers beneath it. Things start off slow, but quickly escalate and if you really want a challenge, you can tap the R button to cause things to speed up even faster and increase the risk of getting trapped.Like Mr. Driller, if you get stuck beneath a big block, youll die and unlike that game, this has no live system. At least there, in the endless mode, you could pick lives  theres no such setup here and its about as tough as that franchises basic campaign since you have to play carefully. The core gameplay is simple to understand, but a bit tricky to master since you need to make everything work for you. The rocks can get in your way, or they can be an ally since you can use them as a base to move other pieces around. Like any puzzler, you want to keep the pieces in small rows or stacks so they can be managed and not get too high. You need to play this with a clear mind and focus on the task at hand. If you rush, youll make big mistakes.The key is to get a rhythm going, then increase the pace slowly so you can keep the action nice and fast. After a few deaths, you start to realize just what too fast equals. The mechanics are solid, and while this is a fairly no-frills affair, it is quite fun. The better you do, the better youll feel, and youll also unlock the some characters along the way that each have a super power you can use to aid you, although none are game-breaking  they simply help you with things like moving around the field faster or eliminating the rocks. No matter which character you choose, youll need skill to make solid progress in the game.Visually, there isnt a lot going on that will excite you. The art style is crisp, but there arent many visual flourishes except for some UFO lighting above the playing field. Puzzle games are never the most cutting edge, but this one definitely looks a bit underwhelming. Every color is solid with a thick black outline, but there isnt much shading, and it leads to things looking a bit bland overall. The colors and outlines are strong though, so on a small screen, you wont have any trouble telling which colors youre dealing with.Musically, things are solid. The chiptune soundtrack has a relaxed vibe to it, but does get intense at times. Its somewhat cheery, but not overly cheery  its just easy listening. The burger-flipping and rock-hitting sound effects are just the right mix of cartoony and realistic, but other than some UFO beam sounds, there isnt much to hear in UFO Dad. As a result, its fun to listen to, but not essential  you can mute the game and lose next to nothing. Closing Comments:", "date": "December 24, 2013", "grade": 3.0}
