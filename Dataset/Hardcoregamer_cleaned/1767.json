{"name": "Pokmon Legends: Arceus", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=418138", "text": "For over 25 years now, Pokmon has been enjoyed worldwide with fans eating up every new subsequent release. The formula as people have come to know it has hardly changed, usually resulting in similar but excitable titles that give players new ways to enjoy the Pokmon they love. That was drastically shifted with the reveal of Pokmon Legends: Arceus which appeared to offer an entirely different kind of Pokmon adventure, making fans excited for what could come to be. Theres never been a shakeup in the main series quite like it with many people becoming cautiously optimistic it would become a game-changer. While thats obviously yet to be seen, is Pokmon Legends: Arceus all its cracked up to be or is it another short-lived tale of modern Pokmon?The story begins as a young child washes up on the shores, only to be discovered by professor Laventon nearby the bustling Jubilife Village. During this meeting, Laventon loses control of the three Pokmon hed been in charge of and asks the youth to help capture them. Impressed by their ability to capture Pokmon, Laventon requests that they join the Galaxy Team and help research Pokmon to create the first ever Pokedex. After passing a trial from the Galaxy Team leader, theyre granted the ability to begin research and help search for how or why theyve ended up in this place. Theyre soon to begin helping as Noble Pokmon in each area have started to become frenzied, and its up to the Galaxy Team and others to figure out whats causing it and put a stop to things before they get too far out of control. Its hard to go into detail without spoiling some of the finer elements of the story, but the tale of Pokmon Legends: Arceus is one of the most enjoyable the franchise has ever told. While it doesnt reach the peaks of Black and White or perhaps Sun and Moon, the story is a much welcome change to a series that has typically followed patterns with simplistic stories instead of trying to see what they can push with their long-lived franchise. Seeing a world in which people fear Pokmon is a wonderful change of pace as getting to see people begin to befriend creatures or slowly conquer their fears is a charming way to see just how the strong bond of humans and Pokmon began.Going out into the tall grass without a Pokmon is dangerous, this is something any long-time Pokmon fan is well aware of. In the Hisui region, however, people are lucky if they have a Pokmon of their own and the dangers of the tall grass are more threatening on a persons life than ever before. Once players step outside into the wild for the first time theyll discover countless Pokmon waiting to be captured, fought or studied. The goal is a mix of things depending on how its chosen to approach. Professor Laventon would love for the Pokedex to be completed, which requires research and study of the over 200 Pokmon that live in the region. How thats accomplished exactly is with the every helpful usage of Pokmon and Pokballs. Along the way players may also receive requests from NPCs in Jubilife Village which will usually ask them a Pokmon-related task such as seeing or capturing one for themselves to reward items and other useful things when out and about. When ready to set off, players select an area they wish to explore which will slowly expand over time. Time changes in these areas over a set period of time, and they are free to explore to their hearts content with areas for healing, dropping of items and switching out any Pokmon that have been captured. Capturing Pokmon is accomplished in a handful of ways as they can simply have a ball thrown at them or initiate a battle and lower their health in order for the best odds. The charming thing is that all Pokmon will react differently. Its easy to get wooed into a false sense of security around Bidoof who will happily waddle up to any people nearby and can simply be bopped on the head to capture. Meanwhile the nearby Shinx in the starting area will be quick to attack if they see anyone. While combat will also be mostly familiar to returning players, theres also the inclusion of new styles for attacks. Agile style allows players to attack quickly and have a chance for a follow up, while Power style has the attack do more damage at the potential cost of the opponent getting to move a little faster. Not just Pokmon are under threat of being attacked which is why researchers must be aware and dodge, run or battle in order to quell an angry Pokmons feelings. Getting hit too many times by a Pokmon will cause a blackout, which results in a loss of some items and returning to the base camp to heal back up. Its not hugely detrimental, but makes players more cautious. The big draw of capturing is completing pokedex entries which can be reported to Professor Laventon for money and points to rank up. Ranking up rewards the ability to use higher level Pokmon and access to more items to help while continuing research. Theres a lot that can be done with little research fortunately, so the pace at which the player approaches this is entirely up to them the whole way, making for an adventure with lots of options for just how to approach the journey at hand.One of the biggest parts of progressing is the very exploration itself. Each area in Hisui is surprisingly large with many Pokmon lurking in every corner of the map. Aside from that there are also trees and rocks that can be broken by Pokmon in order to obtain helpful items for crafting. Recipes obtained from those in Jubilife village help ease a researchers concerns. Pokeballs are the most necessary item to craft but others include potions, ways to scare off wild Pokmon and ways to stay stealthily invisible for a moment. These respawn fairly regularly, especially if the area is left and come back to, so its hard to run out but if items are running low they can often be bought by helpful merchants. Pokmon that appear in the wild often do so based on time of day, weather or may even be a more rare appearance that isnt always there. This makes multiple visits to the same place often result in different outcomes, making it worthwhile to revisit. Upon leaving the village its also likely that an outbreak will be reported which means one particular Pokmon will be temporarily more available in a select area. This is great for many harder-to-find Pokmon or those that just need to be researched more. Along the way players might also stumble across lost satchels which can actually belong to other people and will return items they lost when they blacked out. In return players will receive MP, which can be used to purchase certain evolution items in Jubilife Village, making it worthwhile to go out of ones way to grab these while exploring. Of course exploring on foot is all well and fine for the most part, but some places are completely inaccessible without a little help from Pokmon willing to offer their services.Throughout the story five different ride Pokmon will be gifted to the player to help in their exploration. Each of these functions as a way to travel or search more easily, from being able to move faster with Wyrdeer or be able to survey the water with Basculegion. These make traversal feel great when theyve been unlocked with the only drawback is that most cannot have pokeballs thrown from their backs so players will need to get off first before catching Pokmon. Fortunately switching between them is quick and snappy making it easy to switch on the fly at a moments notice. These are integral to get to the more reclusive areas and discover secrets that await and in general just help get across big areas faster. Wyrdeer is one of the most useful as it offers faster land travel and is great if needing to escape an aggressive Pokmon. It would be nice, however, if Braviary could fly up instead of simply soaring flat or down, but generally speaking its easy to reach high places even without Braviary so its not hugely detrimental.Another big element comes from story encounters with Frenzied Pokmon. These are some of the most fun encounters a player will find themselves involved with. Its unknown why Frenzied Pokmon are acting up, but they need to be quelled so they can continue their noble duties. Thanks to quick thinking from the Galaxy team, they determine the best form of action is to pelt the frenzied nobles with satchels of their favorite food. The brave researcher will then go into an arena where they face the frenzied Pokmon on, having to avoid their attacks while throwing the satchels in order to calm them down. If theyre lucky the Pokmon may become dazed and they can begin a battle to help lower their health quicker. These are the most action-based segments of the story, creating a great amount of variety in each unique frenzied Pokmon encounter. It would be nice if there were a few more, but its worth noting that upon completing the story these nobles can be challenged again in a much harder version of their clash.One of the biggest glaring blemishes on Pokmon Legends: Arceus are some of the visuals themselves. While the Human and Pokmon models are utterly wonderful and guaranteed the best theyve been to date, much of the terrain cant say the same. Its most noticeable when flying or swimming across water, but there is a lot of pop-in for both models and textures which can be jarring when its so rapid at times. The textures themselves are also muddy and bland in many areas, while others can be surprisingly pretty in the right lighting and when simply walking around instead of looking far off in the distance. It doesnt take away from how fantastic everything else is, but it would have been nice if the surroundings were as wonderful to look at all the time as the Pokmon. Models of the Pokmon themselves steal the show, in addition to some of the best attack animations the series has had by a long shot. Its truly enjoyable to watch battles play out now, especially given the player can freely move around on the battlefield to examine it from any angle. The soundtrack, on the other hand, might be one of the greatest in the mainline series to date. Although most of the songs are remixes of titles from the Diamond and Pearl titles, they have a great mix of feeling nostalgic and whimsical at the same time. Occasionally theyll feel ominous when near a threatening Pokmon, but it builds a great atmosphere the whole time that makes it a delight for the ears. Closing Comments: It wouldnt be difficult to claim that Pokmon Legends: Arcues is the strongest Pokmon title the series has had since the DS era. Although some of the visuals leave a bit to be desired, the core of everything else is fantastic and gives players many ways to play while also offering arguably the biggest challenge in the series to date. Thats not to mention the meaty post-game that offers hours more enjoyable content to complete, which is something that the other Switch titles can hardly claim without the inclusion of paid DLC. Not only is Pokmon Legends: Arceus the biggest leap in innovation the series has ever had, but its deserving of praise for being a wonderful and charming adventure the entire way through. Hopefully we see more in this vein in the future, as its sure to leave anyone who plays it craving to see what else could be done moving forward.", "date": "February 3, 2022", "grade": 4.5}
