{"name": "Super Night Riders", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=195117", "text": "Back in 2013, neko.works created Night Riders. It was released on the OUYA and other Android platforms and gave people a barren wasteland to race through while racing the clock and avoiding rival drivers. It was a game that relied heavily on limited graphics to look good, and it worked well. Now, theyre back with yet another nod to classic arcade racing games. Sega was the undisputed king of mid-to-late 80s arcade racers. With both Hang-On and Outrun to their credit, they created games that didnt just munch quarters  they stood the test of time. Hang-On was inspired a bit by Pole Position  only it was a more modernized version on motorcycles. It combined traditional racing formulas with an arcade-tough level of difficulty. Outrun followed up on that and would be more akin to what we now know as an endless runner. Your goal wasnt to beat rivals  you just had to get to a new area before running out of time. Our young rider Alice has set out to hang onto her bike and outrun her opponents while also beating the clock.The core game is split into two sections  the Course mode where you race through six areas in a row and another mode called Stage where you will go through each of the six areas at different times, and with a six lap goal with more rivals racing and getting in your way. With a name like Super Night Riders, the time of day youre racing in should play a factor and it does. Races set during the day are generally going to be easier than those at night because you have more advance notice of both enemies and turns. Racing at night is a lot harder because you cant see very far in front of you  but bright tail lights do making seeing your opponents slightly easier. Racing through each of the six areas feels different, as the environment completely changes with a slick morphing effect occurring as you go from one area to the next. It can be a bit jarring at times, but it never gets in the way of enjoying the game.The Stage mode may seem a bit redundant since you will likely tackle it after already playing and/or beating Course  but it isnt. The ever-increasing difficulty of each area you unlock keeps you busy, and with the bump up in turns comes a marked increase in enemy placement. Theyll get in your way and be far more aggressive here, and while that may sound like a bad thing, it does add to the fun in the long-run. You wind up with a far more rewarding experience and something you can enjoy for a longer period of time. One nice benefit to already being somewhat familiar with these areas is that they seem all-new when you play them at different times of the day. Going through the City area at night is your only option in Course mode, but playing it in Stage mode lets you see just how much different navigation is with a lot of extra lighting at day. The dusk lighting is also interesting as it gives you a touch of lighting from the sky, but not a lot  so you still need to rely on your night driving skills to succeed.No matter which mode you spend the most time with, youll be controlling your bike around with great ease. The left stick is used to move the bike, and either A or RT accelerate. Similarly, you can set braking to either B or LT. Those used to a pre-trigger control scheme may want to use the face buttons, while those who prefer triggers to control their vehicle will definitely want to make use of them here. Strangely, this sendup to the days of old doesnt use allow for the D-pad for movement by default even with arrow keys essentially acting in the same way. It doesnt hurt the game much though, as you can rebind everything before you play the game if you want to.Visually, Super Night Riders is fairly large improvement over the original game  but it still has some quirks that make it feel like a work in progress. While the world and riders themselves have been given a nice overhaul in detail, the animation is still limited in a bad way.This love letter to the classics doesnt use pixel art, and instead goes for a heavily-shaded polygonal look. It allows the game to pay homage to the past with a simplistic-looking style while also remaining beautiful and eye-catching. Each of the games six core stages look gorgeous. The low-polygon look works very well and delivers a smooth experience. The games biggest visual flaw is definitely its wonky animation  as movement on the bike looks stiff and Alice tends to get stuck in a position on the bike she shouldnt be in. After turns, shell be left in a leaning position that looks weird when shes just driving on straightaways. Its a minor thing, but it takes you out of the action and is something that hopefully gets fixed up in time.With only four songs, Super Night Riders really does need more depth to its soundtrack. While the songs are addictive to listen to, some have been re-used from the original game. Every song is good, but Ride the Night remains my absolute favorite. It is on-par with the best tracks from Outrun and Hang-On, and is worth getting the soundtrack for on its own. The sound effect work is solid, but unspectacular. Tire screeches and engine roars are fine, but wont stick with you after playing. Running into someone is probably the most effective sound effect since it really does sound like a violent collision, and it should since that will impede you more than anything else in the game.Closing Comments:Super Night Riders is a good game with a lean amount of content. As a result, it can get old quickly  but the key to it, as it was for arcade classics, is to play it in short bursts. By doing that, you maximize the amount of fun you can have with the game. The low-polygon look is visually-impressive and it controls well using an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller. Anyone seeking some fun motorcycle racing action should give it a shot because while it is limited in content, everything here is mostly well-executed outside of rider animations.", "date": "February 29, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
