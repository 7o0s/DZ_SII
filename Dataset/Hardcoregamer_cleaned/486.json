{"name": "Empathy: Path of Whispers", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=259708", "text": "If theres one thing titles like What Remains of Edith Finch have proven as of late, its that the dysphemistic coining of walking simulator can still throw up an interesting tale/execution from time to time. Yes, theres still life in perhaps one of video games most sneered-at sub-genres  a genre that has often been narrative-first, gameplay-second and perhaps deserved some, though not all, the criticism it has coming its way. Intended artistry trumping any and all facets that keep the player interested enough to carry on. Theres a bit to immediately recognize and thus draw comparisons with in Pixel Nights own tale with Empathy: Path of Whispers. The likes of more notable titles like Gone Home, Everybodys Gone to the Rapture, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter & Dear Esther clearly present in the all-round design and narrative process of this deviation into more surreal, dreamscape-esque surroundings.Like most titles of its ilk, Empathy starts fairly vague as to the specifics of its premise outside of a few notable assumptions and possible outcomes  references to disorder, panic, a public uprising and so on laying the foundation to what is a fairly non-sturdy affair plot-wise and, unfortunately, with its overall delivery likewise. While its disconnect from reality and thrust-together conflict of locales and environments  derelict outposts meshed with public parks which themselves transition to a train station and so on  may seem contextually fine given the games setting, Path of Whispers greatest draw is, like many games before it, its over-indulgence in the plot and not enough care put into the many steps the player takes. The only means of interaction a player can have on a game so adamant on crafting a provocative story, often being to simply turn the next figurative page of the tale.With Empathy: Path of Whispers, this is done through a fairly novel puzzle-solving mechanic that involves lining up sound wave-like frequencies upon discovery of an item flitting between existence and non-existence. The idea is that players must alter the wave through adjusting its amplification, wave-length and frequency in order to get the object to materialise and continue on the story being told, which often takes the form of a particular characters story-arc  be this a monologue or a dialogue exchange between other characters whom also have their own separate storylines throughput the course of the game. While the puzzle-solving doesnt lend itself to any radical shifts or means of evolution, the concept is sufficient enough to break up the ample amount of back-tracking the player will likely make as they needlessly go back and forth between environments, hunting down the next assortment of items that are the only means to actively progress through the games World itself. By which point, the player is placed in a flashback-like scenario affiliated with one of the aforementioned story characters  often involving merely placing plot-specific items in a certain order/place before the blue-filter phase of these moments disappears and the game casually returns to its former state of hunting down more items.Thats not to say Empathys multi-character, multi-perspective tale is entirely without success  at its best Pixel Night doing a satisfying job at establishing a series of protagonists/antagonists that are intricately placed during the games ten hour play through, balancing each others arcs out without feeling overly dominant or complacent by contrast. Each with their own destined paths, some clashing with others. Though as intriguing as it may be to work out particular characters motives and relationships, the World itself  as indeed the lacklustre and fairly basic means of gameplay  doesnt help the fact that Empathy feels like a game using its dreamy aesthetic to excuse its bloated scope, lack of worthwhile interaction and admittedly deprived physical design. Though some environments such as the twentieth-century train station do manage to make their voided space seem justified and fairly eerie as a result, most of Empathys general design doesnt pose the same level of reason or sensual connection on the players part. And this is of course leaving out the ample cases of low-resolution textures, stock sound effects and blocky geometry that can crop up in the games more tighter and claustrophobic situations. Sadly the visuals are the least of Empathys woes regarding what the player may come up against in their travels.Or rather, what they wont; for a game that is initially so heavily structured around finding a particular amount of objects to progress the game forward, in one example of getting a train to move to reach the next destination, the sheer lack of subtle guidance or blatant instruction otherwise on what the player must do (or perhaps isnt doing) is the kind of unwelcome surprise that lands itself as the best case of a game narrowly focused on its story, it forgets about the most fundamental of interactions between itself and the most important person of the whole experience: the player. Closing Comments:While it may not indulge as much on its aesthetic to better hide the distinct lack of gameplay, Empathy: Path of Whispers cant excuse itself for letting its eye go too far a stray from keeping its player both focused and interested in the tale being spun. Though its far from the actual narratives fault for the games all-round mediocre delivery, the insistency on following an established formula across a bulk of the games all-round length doesnt excuse the choppy, blurred and fairly average quality of its visual design. The warranted need to fine-tune its brief puzzles aside, Empathy: Path of Whispers is intriguing in moderation, but little else.", "date": "June 5, 2017", "grade": 3.0}
