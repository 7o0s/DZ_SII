{"name": "Batman: The Enemy Within  Episode 4: What Ails You", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=287607", "text": "Since the final episodes of the first season of Telltales Batman series, the developer has directly hinted at the key focus of the ongoing second season: the rise of the Joker. Known solely as John Doe in this interpretation, Doe has evolved into one of the series most engrossing characters, constantly keeping players on their toes as his erratic behavior and complicated relationships continue to surprise and intrigue in a variety of ways through his interactions with Wayne and The Pact. As The Enemy Within begins its push towards its finale, Does presence needed to become less of a secondary factor and more of a primary focus for Telltale to live up to its promise of a Joker-focused season. What Ails You does a solid job of enhancing Does dynamic within Telltales version of Gotham, as this shorter episode sets players up for an open-ended finale with grand ramifications for Wayne and his cohorts.While the remainder of the review will not address any spoilers from What Ails You, important plot points from the previous episodes of the season will be discussed below. For more on the season so far, check out the reviews for The Enigma, The Pact and Fractured Mask.Yet another patented Telltale major decision set the stage for the ending of Fractured Mask, as players were forced to either blow their own cover and sacrifice themselves, or allow Catwoman to take the fall in order to prevent further damage from taking place. While the consequences that are shown at the beginning of What Ails You can turn out to be pretty severe, not enough time is given to reflect on the impact of that decision, which feels even stranger when considering the relatively short nature of this episode. This turns out to be a single instance complaint, as the chapter pushes onwards and provides some truly pivotal scenes with the well-voiced cast of The Enemy Within. Both the quieter and more high-tension moments do an effective job at developing the large cast as well as setting elements in place as the season starts to wind down. The setup for the finale feels better executed than the premiere season, with a less clear-cut path laid ahead for Wayne to attempt to overcome the remaining obstacles that put his city and his relationships in danger. As has been the case for most of this season, the detective work takes a backseat for brief scenes of exploration, longer scenes of dialogue and one of the most brutal fight scenes in a Batman video game. As mentioned earlier on, What Ails You is primarily highlighted by the performance of Anthony Ingruber, who takes his performance of the Joker to new heights as the character himself takes a few leaps of faith and comes out the other end a transformed being, for better or worse. The other presentational elements of this episode remain strong as well, with no technical issues to speak of during our playthrough.Closing Comments:What Ails You keeps the stakes high as Wayne continues to juggle numerous issues and relationships within the city of Gotham. While the short runtime can make this episode seem a bit more like filler, the usually stellar voice cast and key moments help keep the momentum up during the penultimate episode.", "date": "on January 24, 2018", "grade": 4.0}
