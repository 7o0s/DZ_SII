{"name": "WWE 2K17", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=231440", "text": "To say that the WWE video games had a rocky start this generation would be a grave understatement, with WWE 2K15 receiving near-unanimous panning by both critics and fans alike. While 2K16 was certainly a stronger step in the right direction, it still wasnt what many wrestling fans were looking for in a video game adaptation of the sport/entertainment, with plenty yearning for the more arcade-style gameplay of years past. Although WWE 2K17 doesnt make a grand attempt at correcting its overall course, this years entry has still been greatly anticipated as the long-overdue wrestling game that this console generation deserves. Yet, thanks to repetitive, bug-heavy gameplay, uninspired modes, and lackluster graphics, WWE 2K17 represents another sub-par year for the franchise, despite a continued dedication to authenticity and customization.WWE 2K17s core gameplay remains largely unchanged from years past, with similar controls encouraging players to only need to remember a few key moves in order to achieve victory. 2K17 continues the baffling annual tradition of not including any sort of tutorial, with the gameplay manual solely available via online research, which is off-putting to newcomers. For those who stick it out, most of the played matches will end up seeming pretty close thanks to an in-match rating system which prioritizes match length above all else, but one rarely feels like the bout ever has a chance of slipping away from them without some grand intervention or shift in course. Plus, especially in the early goings of a match, its overly-easy to count out an opponent in a one-on-one match, much to the chagrin of the aforementioned rating system and the players overall enjoyment. These one-on-one matches also suffer from poor camera angles whenever players try to leave the ring, with these views being especially obfuscated during the returning Backstage Brawls, which, much like their in-arena counterparts, often blend in with one another after a few rounds.WWE 2K17s simple ability to allow players to jump right into a wide variety of matches is certainly one of its strong points, despite locking out many of the characters and arenas available behind microtransactions and pre-order bonuses. The other modes available are irredeemably empty, doesnt grant the player any additional sort of motivation to prefer one mode over another. MyCareer returns again this year, with a very limited amount of voiced dialogue and locations that are inaccessible outside of the mode. After the completion of the bare-bones tutorial, which does very little to inform or advise, players are then shuffled into standard matches with only a confusing, non-voiced promo system and a microtransaction-centric upgrade system to break the monotony. The WWE Universe mode does not fare any better, with even fewer exclusive features or mechanics to discourage the player from just performing these matches on their own, instead of having them be shuffled from one fight to another with no clear reasoning. 2K17s online modes are somewhat of a bright spot; on one hand, 2Ks impressive decision to make a significant amount of the available match modes online-compatible actually works against the player, as it makes getting into even something as simple as a standard Triple Threat match rather unlikely and time-consuming. However, those fortunate enough to get into an online bout will find a definitively more chaotic experience thanks to the removal of the opponent targeting mechanic and the unpredictability of online foes.Speaking of bright spots, 2Ks commitment to authenticity is arguably unparalleled mostly due to the extensive nature of the WWE roster. While there are definitely a few standouts as far as characters whose moves, entrances, or attires are outdated (particularly after the recent roster split), the vast majority of the roster not only has realistic presentations and appearances for their elaborate in-ring entrances, complemented by an impressive and accurate soundtrack, but their performances inside the ring are astoundingly spot-on as well. This is extraordinary considering the varied takes on fighting styles each member of the WWE roster brings to the table. While the crowds chants and commentators dialogue are both rather limited (and occasionally incorrect), they are both sufficient enough to providing an event-like experience, from ones standard Monday Night Raw to the complexities of Wrestlemania, even if the arenas they take place in are all rather similar. This level of authenticity continues over into the games customization, which provides a vast amount of options for shaping not only wrestlers but arenas, belts, entrances, and much more. 2Ks willingness to include dozens of aspects from the multi-decade history of WWE inside of 2K17 shines brightly in these customizable abilities and provides for some truly awe-inspiring and/or hilarious final results.While WWE 2K17s audio stands strong thanks to the aforementioned library of entrance songs which is complimented by the varied official soundtrack curated by Puff Daddy, the overall graphical quality is certainly one of its strongest setbacks. With much of the games roster and arenas resembles an early release from the previous generation of consoles, as opposed to a game developed and released in 2016. The technical problems with the game are quite numerous as well, with collision issues being the most prominent. In a title where physical violence between opponents and objects is as central as it is, having the on-screen characters reacting poorly or not at all to various attacks proved to be quite frustrating, even if it didnt always change the end result of a match or draw too greatly from the overall enjoyment of playing. The overall experience was mostly smooth though, with no substantial framerate drops or lag during online play, and only one crash during our time with it.Closing Comments:Although WWE 2K17 didnt need to be a strong step forward from its previous release, its still difficult not to be disappointed with how little has changed from year-to-year. The core combat is best at its most chaotic, whether online or with friends, but still often ranges from frustratingly inconsistent to annoyingly repetitive, and the desolate nature of MyCareer and WWE Universe dont do much to help players forget that. Fans looking for authentic and customizable WWE action at the expense of up-to-date graphics will surely get a kick out of the impressive amount of options and realistic animations available, which may be enough look past some of the games other issues. But for everyone else, its getting increasingly difficult to rely on 2K to provide a quality modern wrestling game that the medium and its ever-expanding base of devotees deserve.", "date": "on October 19, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
