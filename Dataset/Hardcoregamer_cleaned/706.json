{"name": "Japanese School Life", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=237360", "text": "The fanbases of anime, manga and video games often intertwine. As such, there are a fair number of gamers who dont live in Japan but view this country as an amazing location filled with creative output due to their media. Some fans are so in love with the region that they take trips there  or at least dream of one day visiting Japan. It is exactly this mindset which fuels our protagonist Brian in the new visual novel Japanese School Life. Hes an everyday teenager with a deep love for practically everything Japanese and desperately wants to go there. As such, he enlists as an exchange student and gets selected to spend one year at a Japanese high school. His dream has finally, if only temporarily, come true!With a working knowledge of the Japanese language, Brian should do just fine. The only trouble is he knows absolutely nobody there. Fortunately, two classmates suddenly speak to him on day one which ensures he wont become a total loner for the year abroad. Chiyoko and Arisa are also in his class, and both school girls are more than happy to interact with new kid Brian. Despite being friends, the two young women are quite different when it comes to personalities. Chiyoko is your typical straight A student who outwardly seems perfect in every way. Arisa, on the other hand, is brash, excitable, and often finds herself struggling with school material. Brian presents a bit of a middle-ground between them. He desires to do well while enrolled in this school but also gets extremely passionate when matters related to anime and manga flare up. With Arisa and Chiyoko in tow, Brian is set to have a wonderful year living and studying in Japan. Japanese School Life is similar to visual novels such as Go! Go! Nippon in that they assume the player audience is not native to Japan. As such, expect to go through the game hearing these two women explain all manner of Japanese customs, folklore, and holidays. As Brian has a full year in Japan, you get to see their New Years celebration as well as Valentines Day-esque White Day. Events that players may be familiar with through anime such as Golden Week also have their place in the storyline. Those who are already tremendously immersed in Japanese culture may find these constant explanations annoying. However, many probably are unaware of many of the points Chiyoko and Arisa bring up over the course of the game.It might sound like Japanese School Life is just a visual novelized teaching tool. Thats not quite the case, though in many instances it does feel that way. Beyond both girls acting as living Wikipedia entries, they do have a bit of fun as typical high schoolers do. They lounge around, engage in karaoke, and even attend events such as Comiket together. The writing does cause a bit of confusion early on, however. For example, it initially seems as though Brian is forcing his newfound friends to go to locations such as Akihabara repeatedly because thats what he wants to do. With the two following his every desire, it really calls into question the friendship these three apparently have. By the end, their friendship solidifies a little, but not enough to be particularly believable. The friendship angle isnt given enough time to develop because the entirety of Japanese School Life is just around three hours long. Between the constant knowledge bombs, theres only little room left to give their relationships attention. There are also dialogue choices to be made during a playthrough, but no matter what you choose, youll only end up working toward one of two endings. Choices differ in that they give players a different line or two, which is an incredibly minimal way to handle them. Although there are two endings, both are almost exactly the same. Brian apparently manages to frame his future based on a small amount of subtly different interactions between Chiyoko and Arisa.While the actually storytelling may fail a bit due to its heavy emphasis on educating players, the visuals do not suffer in any way. Backdrops are lively and lovingly detail real locations in Japan. Arisa and Chiyoko are also given a great deal of attention with bright anime artwork. Their sprites use the e-mote system which makes them far more active than static sprites. Occasionally there are also chibi artwork CG scenes which liven things up further. The Japanese voice acting for both characters (theres no voice acting for Brian) is excellent. This is thanks to acquiring two established voice actresses to assume these high schooler roles. Theres a cool feature in Japanese School Life which allows players to read the text in Japanese and English simultaneously. This is a great move given most seeking out this game are probably already involved with studying Japanese in some capacity. One weird aspect of the text is that the games default font seems to turn dashes into question mark symbols. It has not been patched thus far, and initially leads to some confusion comprehending dialogue. Other than that though, the release is mostly clear of typos which is always good to see from smaller visual novels.Closing Comments:Japanese School Life is not a new idea in the visual novel space  Go! Go! Nippon and the confusingly similarly named Tokyo School Life both offer a similar plot. The good thing is that this title approaches the concept of educating non-Japanese citizens a bit differently. It isnt intended as a guide for prospective travelers, nor is it purely a slice of life story. This title attempts to meld an educational focus with endearing characters. Unfortunately, it doesnt manage to create compelling characters or plot. The information gained about Japan while playing is valid and factual, but that alone isnt enough to make the entire experience enjoyable.", "date": "November 28, 2016", "grade": 2.5}
