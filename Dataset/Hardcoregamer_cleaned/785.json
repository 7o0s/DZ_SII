{"name": "Event[0]", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=230467", "text": "In one of those weird moments where we discuss a completely different game before moving on to the subject of the actual review, lets talk about The Talos Principle for a bit. Croteams first-person puzzler was terrific and had some superb level design, but one of the most interesting parts involved the moments where you have philosophical debates with Milton, an artificial intelligence, entirely through choices in an old DOS setup. The description of it may sound odd to those who have never played the game, but trust me when I say that those parts were highly engaging indeed. And now along comes Event[0], an entire first-person sci-fi adventure revolving around the idea of communication with a computer/chat program in order to progress. Its ambitious, to say the least, but can such an idea carry an entire game? And a good one, at that?Event[0] sees you in an alternate present day where space travel has become more advanced, and after selecting your characters background, you get the story about how they finally achieved their dreams and found themselves as a spaceperson bound for Europa. Unfortunately, the exact second you arrive there, it hits the fan as the space station youre on goes kablooey, leaving you drifting in an escape pod until you find the Nautilus. A relic of the (alternate) 1980s, you board it with the hopes of finding some help and eventually returning to Earthonly, unsurprisingly given these scenarios, no one seems to be on board, and the place is an absolute wreck where something clearly went down. The only thing you can speak to is Kaizen-85, an AI that appears through a series of terminals as a cheerful blivet-shaped mascot. They want to help you escape ASAP as well, and tell you to follow their instructions and head to bridge. And you can trust them, right?The unique selling point of Event[0] is that not only are all of your significant actions are performed through Kaizen and the various terminals they inhibit, but you can interact with Kaizen by typing in whatever you want  virtually anything  and they will respond and react appropriately, able to tell you whatever they can about the Nautilus and its crew. Its a true test of artificial intelligence that isnt perfect, but at the very least is a truly ambitious bit of gameplay, and one that invites players to experiment with the dialogue as much as they can. Its all done through old-school text prompts, of course, with Kaizen even sounding out each syllable of their reply in a low-tech yet endearing fashion. Its the type of gameplay and zeerust style that can best be described as  to steal a term from Yahtzee  DOSpunk, and the game pulls it off incredibly well. And it helps that Kaizen can be a bit adorable, lets be honest.Visually, Event[0] isnt that much different from the likes of, say, Alien: Isolation, with cluttered messes in each room, busted machinery, various retro knick-knacks as decorations, et cetera. But it still all looks impressive nonetheless, and does its job in creating an effectively mysterious atmosphere that leaves you wanting to know more. You also get to learn about the past Nautilus crew through the various access logs Kaizen has regarding each section, with a lot of entries that are conveniently corrupted, but that provide some insight into what it was like for them. I had some difficulty getting invested in them myself, but definitely found the greater mystery overall to be interesting. The terminals are also notably used for a few hacking puzzles, which can get a bit creative and provide a good level of challenge.The emphasis on communications through a keyboard even affects the default control scheme as well. Since typing in WASD around Kaizen will create nothing but mindless wads of text on the terminals, movement is instead done simply through having the left mouse button move you forward and the right mouse button to move backwards, moving it around to essentially aim yourself, and stopping and focusing on an object to get a description. It takes a moment or two to get used to, but it does work quite nicely, and does feel a tad more immersive. The controls for when youre outside the ship are a bit trickier, with the right mouse button slowing your thrust down instead. Incidentally, these sections make for the games most tense moments, where you have to carefully monitor your oxygen as you maneuver around the outside of the ship, and having to work with other terminals and convince a stubborn or puzzled Kaizen to let you in before you perish. It really captures Event[0] at its greatest potential.However, Kaizen is kind of a double-edged sword for the game, oddly enough. Sure, theyre an interesting character that you can chat with for quite a while, but as hinted at, it turns out they apparently have some limitations and difficulties when it comes to understanding human speech or conversations. More often then not, Kaizen would answer a question I had by revealing some sort of fact about the ship or the crew, and when I gave a follow-up question like What do you mean? or even something more specific, they would reply with something unrelated. Maybe Kaizen was intentionally trying to avoid the subject, but even if theyre ultimately endearing, moments like these got incredibly frustrating.It also doesnt help that Kaizens difficulty in communicating directly ties in to another flaw the game has, in that its ending suddenly just appears too sudden, with things feeling too short. Event[0] is only about three hours long at best, an appropriate amount of time for a narrative-focused games such as this (in my opinion, anyway), and yet when I reached the end, I couldnt help but ask Was that it? And part of it is because a good chunk of world-building is hidden not just within access logs for each terminal, but in conversations with Kaizen themselves. And rarely are any of these narrative moments required to progress the plot, as Kaizen is only trying to assist you with reaching the bridge. So several plot-relevant moments are completely optional, and it definitely feels like you can finish it while skipping some hefty bits of the greater story. Heck, it wasnt even until after I had beaten the game and looked at the achievement list that I found out about the hidden commlink messages, which actually would have provided a major source of foreshadowing.And the storys structure feels a bit off as well. The game constantly states that the way you talk to Kaizen will influence the ending, but it honestly felt that you pretty much have to go out of your way to be a dick to them for a bad ending. And a large part of that is that because again, a lot of notable talks with Kaizen are optional, so the game never sets up any opportunities to get into any debates or passionate discussions with them that might lead each of us to treat the other differently. The only times anything like this happened are when you find yourself outside of the ship, and Kaizen goes slightly HAL 9000 on you and refuses to open the airlock door and let you back in, which even then feel a bit forced.Speaking of which, as mentioned, the spacewalks are the most tense parts of the gameso its a shame that there are only two of them overall. It really does feel like theres an entire second or third act missing from Event[0], or that another one is sorely needed. There just arent enough opportunities to build a notable relationship with Kaizen, nor enough to really let the more horror-oriented parts of the game shine through. It feels more like the developers had a specific set of conversations designed to be used with Kaizen, but didnt figure out the best way to lead the player along through them. So as good as the story is overall, it definitely has room for improvement.Closing Comments:When you get down to it, the only major flaw of Event[0] is that there isnt enough of it. Or, alternatively, that what is there needed to be reconnected into more of a tighter story. Still, the end result manages to be a highly-interesting science fiction story worth checking out, with several genuinely exciting and creepy moments and an innovative central gameplay concept that deserves to be experimented with. It may be a bit annoying at times, but Event[0] is still a quality adventure game that does indeed prove how an entire game based around just chatting with a computer can make for something thats an experience to see for yourself.", "date": "October 17, 2016", "grade": 3.5}
