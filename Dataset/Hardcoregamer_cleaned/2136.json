I cant imagine what that would have been like, but theres something to be said about a critter with such audacity. The squirrels in my neighborhood cower at the sight of a BB rifle  let alone manage a map full of samurai canidae. Thankfully, Nutjitsu  NinjaBees top-down, stealthy arcade title  is as fun as its concept is silly, and fans of Pac-Man and the like will find more than a fair share of content to satisfy their longing for cabinets with colorful buttons and levers.Nutjitsu, not unlike Pac-Man, is all about chasing the score. You roam through randomly generated levels, dodge enemy foxes, collect acorns and amass an impressive (or humiliating) score in the process. Thats the primary goal, and its one thats incredibly fun, despite not being particularly engaging. Youll use power-ups, complete objectives, and attempt to stay alive for as long as possible  thats the long and short of the title. Its the fresh simplicity of mobile gaming brought to the big-screen with all the added benefits youd expect. Its visually appealing, fast-paced, and just the right dose of entertaining.There are two modes in Nutjitsu: Survival Mode and Mission Mode. The first and less entertaining of the two, the aptly named Survival Mode, is one I reserved for power-up farming. While the goal is to amass as high a score as possible before being trampled by a fox, Ive never been one for competing against the masses  and not just because Im terrible at video games. Sure, goal-chasers will appreciate the online leaderboards, and theres certainly fun to be had, but I couldnt help but feel repetition get the best of me after only an hour or so. Its not bad by any means, but without any time constraints, goals or any semblance of purpose, staying alive becomes an exercise in boredom, chasing numbers to no avail. Thankfully, thats not the case across the board.Mission Mode, the second mode on offer, isnt much different in terms of gameplay. Youll still be collecting acorns, evading samurai foxes and prancing about the same maps, only with objectives to stir things up  and do they ever. Most of the objectives, while varied and fun in their own right, are incredibly simple. They rarely require any real effort to accomplish, and are mostly reflex/timing based, demanding perfection only at the highest of difficulty levels.Things like collect so many certain acorns before the timer runs out, or locate and grab that specific object pepper the randomized missions, and theres no linear story mode walling any objective types. Youre free to shuffle through goals as you see fit, and choose the ones that best suit your mood. There is, of course, a benefit to taking whats dished with a smile. I personally found the unsystematic approach refreshing, and it greatly increased my desire to hop back into the action. In summation, random = good in a game with no narrative.While the objectives arent necessarily captivating by any means, they serve their purpose and make for a far more addictive experience. Running through goals becomes second nature after a dozen or so runs, and the added benefit of achievements certainly helps considerably. Collecting those acorns, dodging those villainous foxes and keeping your squirrel avatar alive are goals made all the more important thanks to the ticking clock on the right-hand side of the screen. Indeed, free play is tons of fun, but having missions to complete adds a thick layer of addictive variety.Here are some things youll likely do once Nutjitsu is installed:If youre concerned about challenge, worry not. Nutjitsu has some seriously huge nuts  a pun that had to be made regardless of whether or not its funny. Rather than approach difficulty narrowly, NinjaBee crafted a nifty little feature that makes continuous play all the more interesting. In any given mode, the longer you play, the more enemies flood the screen. As you continue to advance the session, enemies with unique abilities begin to pop about, rushing to stunt your exploration. In that regard, theres no escaping death in Nutjitsu, only avoiding it long enough to amass an impressive score.On surface level, Nutjitsu isnt a particularly difficult game, save for some minor balance issues  such as the impossible odds of conquering a level without using power-ups as a crutch  but it certainly can be. The ability to increase the difficulty is there, and its something youll likely tinker with once your arsenal expands beyond the beginners smoke bombs. As is, theres enough variety to keep the scrabble fresh, and the highest difficulty demands the heightened reflexes of a man/spider combo that you shouldnt try to create with a common black widow because that merely results in a 2AM hospital visit and a series of painful injections. Not that I tried it or anything.Another handy addition is the Xbox One snap feature, which allows you to flick Nutjitsu to the side while you watch live TV, browse the web or launch a second application. Theres no slow down, and the game automatically pauses when snapped. Its one of those didnt know how useful it was until I had it type of features that reminds you why the Xbox One is unique. Its the first game to feature this particular property, and I hope to see it implemented in others.Closing Comments:Nutjitsu is a gorgeous, bite-sized, downloadable game with just enough content to please players through dozens of hours of gameplay. Theres no story mode and, save for the achievements ringing every once in a while, no real sense of progression, either. That, of course, doesnt matter much when you have such an addictive formula, wonderfully detailed visuals and an enjoyable objectives mode. Its simple, fun and incredibly satisfying. Xbox One owners are encouraged to give it a try, and at $6.49 theres no reason not to enter the squirrel. Wait, that sounds weird. Enter the game featuring a squirrel. There we go. At the end of the day, NinjaBee crafted a fantastic game thats worth every cent of its cost and every second of your time.", "date": "May 16, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
