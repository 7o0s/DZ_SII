{"name": "Leos Fortune", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=84569", "text": "Outside of using them to gain an extra life, coins in platform games have always seemed pointless. Behind each adventure lays a small, strong-willed hero ready to grab every single golden coin or similar shiny metallic in sight. Mario and Sonic are as guilty of this as we are for enabling them, but the mystery still remains. How bizarre is it that that weve come so far into this gaming generation without having to question coin collecting? Why are they there? Of what importance do they have to the heroes weve played with before?So far, a blue fluffy, googly-eyed and mustached gentleman by the name of Leopold has been the only hero to have answered this question directly, as told in Leos Fortune, the platform adventure game developed by 1337 & Senri for iOS.As if you couldnt tell from the title, the games main story focuses on the coin mystery by describing Leos misfortune; all of Leos precious, golden coins were stolen from him. Like following a trail of breadcrumbs, Leo rolls, floats, dives and jumps his way through luscious, puzzling and spike-ridden levels, collecting every last bit of his beaming gold currency.The visuals are so astonishingly gorgeous for an iOS game that its almost hard to believe. Whether its the flowery, grassy fields of the spring or the underwater toils of a wrecked boat, playing through each stage is like getting a huge bag of eye candy. Leos Fortune is possibly best looking when playing on an iPad. The high definition picture is never lost, even when running the game on an iPhone, however the application will probably cut off quickly depending on the type of iPhone you have. Its best to stick with the pad here to avoid a hot, battery sapped phone.Players may find themselves stopping the blue bugger mid stage, just to get good look at how colors are brilliantly meshed together. When youre moving Leo at Sonic-like speed, stages still jump out like pop-up books, turning the hand drawn and painted backdrops into fluid, flowing locales that bring about a realistic aesthetic.In a voice hugely similar to Dos Equis frontman Jonathan Goldsmith, Leo narrates the story as players progress, telling the tale of his lost treasure and making assumptions about who the gold coin bandit might be. The voice reinforces Leopolds persona, who finds every bit of his journey as a challenge worth going through.Oh, a puzzle! Leo exclaims upon approaching locked off area, secure only until he guides three marbles to roll onto a weight-connected pulley responsible for anchoring a door. This is dangerous, a nervous Leo speaks upon leaping toward a party of wheeled spikes.What hinders Leopolds character from becoming even more awesome is his unchanging facial expression nor any evidence of a moving mouth when speaking. This also tags onto the overall presentation of the narrating story, as players will be given a slideshow of how Leopolds relationship with his family play a part in his search. But these slideshows are just as they sound: black and white pictures with little animation nor eye capturing visuals in comparison to the rest of the game. The dullness in these two particular pieces doesnt break Leos Fortune by any means, but it does make you wonder how 1337 & Senri put so much focus on the performance and aesthetic of all the levels and held back on transferring that same manner of detail in the story mode and in Leopold himself. Sure, he has the look of an epic character to rival against Kirby and Mario, but without very much facial animation going on, playing Leopold starts to feel like Im moving a normal, regular ball around.Theres nothing that unique when it comes to the actual mechanics, but there is some charm in taking control of a cotton-ball sized engineer who dons a mustache. On the left side of the screen, players are equipped with a horizontal slider that, well, slides Leopold left and right. Sliding and holding the bar at the middle brings him to a stop, but releasing your thumb from the screen calls for the same effect. The right side of the screen equips players with a vertical slider. Swiping up allows the mustached furball to both jump up and inflate like a puffer fish. The inflation can be used to push up overhead levers or to float at the arc of a jump, which will mostly be used when dodging dialed spikes or reaching far away places. Swiping downward deflates Leopold. If the action is done in air, he drops down hard like paper weight. Swiping downward also allows him to bounce off of trampolines and sink underwater.Both of these swiping movements are to be cleverly used in order to bypass physics-based puzzles in the game. Aside from the inflation and deflation moves, Leopold can also push boxes and sleekly maneuver himself through some smaller, more compact areas. Although he may not be Segas fastest mascot, Leopold can also glide and swift through twirls, turns and loop-de-loops that are present in various stages. Shooting himself out of a cannon or allowing himself to launched across the board and smack-dab against a stack of boxes or rocks is an obvious nod to Sonic the Hedgehog, thus triggering a hint of nostalgia.Be prepared to die in most of the games 20 levels. The obstacles and puzzles can get a bit frustrating to get through and your run is even tested by grading you on how well you performed in each level. Not dying once and completing the level in the fastest time possible grants you three stars. Gaining three stars for all 20 is quite a feat, but prepare to have your patience rattled. Controlling Leo can be a tad slippery. One minute youre trying to slide and jump to the next platform and the next second you end up falling into the pits by mistake. Challenging and wholeheartedly welcome, but also a bit irritating considering that even the mapped buttons that youre able to turn on in the option menu provides little to no help in applying strict and precise movements.The biggest downside is that there are no enemies or boss battles. Outside of some of the time attack levels that are unlocked by getting three stars in previous ones, the stages and their booby traps are your only challenge throughout the game. Again, this calls into questions the creative possibilities that 1337 & Senri had the potential to branch out on, but instead youre left with what you have. Leos Fortune is still a great game without any particular baddies to vanquish, but finding the lost batch of gold would have held a bit more meaning if it was being barred away by threats looking to harm Leopold during his many trips across fields, cities, snowy mountains and deserts.Closing Comments:", "date": "May 11, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
