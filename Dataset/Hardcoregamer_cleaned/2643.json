Since then, though, the first person shooter space has changed drastically, offering more games with a stronger focus on multiplayer aspects and cinematic set pieces. Crysis 3 looks to blend an open area setting with cinematic storytelling in offering a visual spectacle like no other, but how can it stand on top of an already crowded marketplace? The answer is simply the nanosuit.The Crysis series has never been well known for its impactful storytelling abilities, a sentiment carried over in the third iteration. While there are some absolutely spectacular events, ranging from dams bursting open to facing multiple giant Pingers at once, the story is rather nonsensical. Crysis 3 takes place over twenty years after the last game where CELL is basically running the desolate and ruined New York City while the alien-force Ceph are still fighting for control over the world. Theres a significant lack of meaningful characters and youll find yourself more interested in how youll approach the next situation rather than whats happening next in the plot. Its more the universe that Crytek has established and the point-by-point moments that will have you enticed in whats to come. Unfortunately, most of the dialogue and emotional story twists lack much of a punch and feel rather stale.While the shiny graphics will have visual fanatics jumping for joy, its the combat variety that made Crysis something special. Its not necessarily the arsenal, but how you use the weaponry effectively. The ultimate nanosuit has barely changed as the standard stealth and armor modes are back for more playtime. It would have been nice to see an additional set of abilities, but what we have serves as a strong array of gameplay mixtures. Every scenario, generally, can be approached in a silent manner, but the game feels as if its pushing more towards a firefight than anything.The biggest problem with the gameplay is that its much too dry. While each scenario will give you plenty of options to approach, its basically the same formula over and over again. Enter a large area, find all the enemies who are scouting, kill or sneak by them, and do it again. Theres one stunning area late in the game that shows so much potential of what the game could have been where its an absolutely massive open space populated with both smaller alien units with heavier ones. It was a hectic war where the rest of the game felt like the enemies were planted in the environment just to act as a progression stalling factor.It certainly doesnt help that enemies can be overly intelligent in seeing you from afar when the smallest piece of your body is peeking out. It almost feels like theyre artificially putting you into a gunfight when you dont want to be in one, making it a bit more challenging to go around and play stealthy. Its also worth noting that Crysis 3 is surprisingly easy. Having played it through on Veteran, my death count was still in the lower single digits as nothing really gave me a run for my money. On a positive note, the always adaptive and changing soundtrack will have your head bobbing and adrenaline rushing when things get chaotic.Our time with the shooter was primarily spent on the PC and theres a reason behind it: the game is a thing of beauty (if your rig can power it). Despite a couple of unpolished spots, the world has been finely crafted to something that has never been seen before in a video game. Lush forests, tall grassy areas, moody ruined cities; Crysis 3 has it all and it looks absolutely astonishing. Theres a perfect blend of both linear narrative and condensed open area environments that are vaster than the series latest installment. You dont need the most powerful computer rig possible to play the game, but top of the line graphics cards and processors are required to obtain maximum performance (having both, I still was unable to get a steady 30 frames per second maxed out). The depth of field, smoke effects, and subtle animations you may or may not notice; these are the things that make Crysis 3 the visual benchmark for not only this generation, but whats in store for the next.The single player campaign isnt the only part of Crysis 3s appeal, as the diverse multiplayer experience has been upgraded from the last go-around. This is probably the most appealing part of the game, as it brings everything youve come to love in the single player campaign into a competitive match-up. Taking the nanosuits abilities and applying it into a multiplayer environment adds a certain level of diversity that differentiates itself from most modern or futuristic shooters on the market. The Hunter mode is by far the most appealing to anyone who enjoys the series stealth elements as it puts regular enemies up against fully nanosuited hunters who are quietly stalking you. Its an incredibly tense experience, especially if youre on the preys side of things as not knowing where an overpowered killing machine will hit next is a pulsating experience.Closing Comments", "date": "February 21, 2013", "grade": 3.5}
