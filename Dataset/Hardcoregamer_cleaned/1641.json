{"name": "Sunless Sea", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=136982", "text": "London has fallen. Thats not a metaphor  cosmic horrors have literally dragged it into the stygian abyss. The whole city now lies at the edge of the Unterzee, a vast underground ocean housed within an impossibly enormous cavern. The dark waters teem with monstrous creatures  immense crabs, sharks bound in chains, and huge, white eels with a taste for blood  and the Victorian city is just a stones throw away from the very mouth of hell (this is also not a metaphor). This is the world of Fallen London, one of the greatest social games ever made, and the first title from British indie studio Failbetter Games. Their second original game, Sunless Sea, takes place in the waters that surround the city, though its about as far from a social game as you can get. Sunless Sea is a seafaring roguelike about loneliness, insanity, and occasionally cannibalism.You are a Zee Captain, an intrepid adventurer who embarks upon the Unterzee in search of treasure, or fame, or your lost fathers remains  the why of it is largely up to you. For whatever reason, you leave the relative safety of Fallen London, where death is a perplexing rarity, to sail blackened waters where it lurks just beneath the surface. Its a dangerous life, but if you can outwit the monsters and pirates that prowl the depths  and stay on the good side of the capricious gods who rule the zee  you can find riches beyond your wildest dreams. Just be warned: dreams can get pretty wild out on the Unterzee. Your captain will die, and when they do youll need to start over from square one  well, almost. With enough capital you can buy a nice house and leave them something in your will.A big part of Sunless Sea is its real-time, top-down combat system. You maneuver through the Unterzee using simple tank controls, and engage enemy ships and monsters using the same inputs. Your ships cannons have a certain firing range, indicated by a vision cone at the fore of the vessel. So long as enemies are within that range, your crew will draw a bead on them and a meter on your gun will fill up until its ready to fire. You can shoot before the meter is full, but you risk missing and having to reload. While keeping your guns trained on the enemy, youll also want to move out of their firing range  or in the case of zee beasts keep a safe distance so they cant ram you. Each of the games enemies requires a slightly different approach, which keeps combat from getting stale. As you progress youll be able to buy bigger and better ships and guns, which make it possible to venture further across the murky waters.Outside of combat, youll need to keep a careful eye on your fuel and supplies, which dwindle steadily as time passes. Run out of fuel and youll be stranded, needing to pray to the gods, make costly deals with unscrupulous zailors, or take your chances in a lifeboat to make it back ashore. Run out of supplies and your crew will start to starve, forcing you to cook precious cargo or even less appetizing meat in order to survive your voyage. You can replenish food by slaughtering zee beasts, and conserve fuel by keeping your lights off, but doing so will cause your crews terror to build much more quickly. Its never easy to maintain a balance between your resources and sanity, and that constant tension does a great deal for Sunless Seas chilling tone.Of course, fuel and supplies are only part of it. Like its predecessor Fallen London, Sunless Sea treats everything from quests to crew members as commodities. You can trade in treasures and goods, but you can also find good prices for a thrilling zee story, or a bit of news from London. As you complete quests and explore youll accrue qualities that provide you with new opportunities. Some of these, in particular favors, can be spent to gain advantages. When you start a new run, your captain will have one bit of beginners luck which can be spent to gain a serious early windfall on certain islands. Even EXP and stats are treated as commodities  in order to increase your iron or veils (strength or stealth) youll have to trade secrets to your ships officers in exchange for training. This isnt exactly surprising coming from Failbetter Games  Fallen London also has a delightfully convoluted economy  but it does make each interaction feel very different from your standard Roguelike.The game tells you at the outset that you can only get ahead by taking risks, and while thats not entirely true (theres a somewhat tedious but reliable trading route you can use to build up capital at a decent pace) you will be richly rewarded for your successful gambles. Your main goal is to find new islands, almost all of which have a strange story to tell. On a given island you might encounter a den of drug smugglers, warring tribes of intelligent rodents, or a society built around officiously bureaucratic acting. Completing these stories successfully (there are many ways to fail if youre ill-prepared or underequipped) will earn you some great loot, but theyre well-written enough to be rewarding in their own right.It feels strange to review Sunless Sea in the same week as we covered The Book of Unwritten Tales 2, which wears the influence of Terry Pratchetts Discworld on its sleeve. Pratchett, with his dark satirical bent and scientific approach to magic, has a lot in common with Neil Gaiman (the two co-wrote Good Omens, a fantastic feel-good novel about the boyhood adventures of the antichrist), and Sunless Sea draws clear inspiration from Gaimans work. The very concept of Fallen London, with its talking rats and dark magic, where the displaced residents of London cling to a twisted parody of their old social structure, is practically lifted straight from Gaimans Neverwhere  though there are shades of Lovecraft and Verne and dozens of other authors mixed in as well.Thats far from a complaint. If youre going to ape the style of any author, there are few better choices than Gaiman, especially when it comes to writing horror fantasy. Failbetter cribs from enough different sources that the game feels like an homage rather than a ripoff, and if youve played their browser game you know that Fallen London is one of the most distinctive and fully-realized settings in gaming. The characters youll encounter on your voyage are invariably bizarre and often sinister, though you can usually avoid trouble by playing along with their customs and maintaining a polite faade. Each island is unique and fascinating, and youll uncover plenty in the way of compelling mystery, dark humor, and spine-chilling horror as you sail around.With that said, the game isnt exactly perfect. You can find yourself out at sea for long stretches where nothing happens, sending your zee bat out over and over again in the hopes of discovering a new island to spice things up. Once youve played through an islands story, there isnt much reason to return save for commodity trading, which can get pretty mind-numbing if theres no new story content immediately available. Also, while the detached top-down perspective helps to create a sense of isolation, I think the atmosphere and horror elements would be considerably more effective from a third-person 3D viewpoint, although obviously the approach Failbetter has taken is far more budget-friendly.Closing Comments:Sunless Sea is a little darker and less cheerful than its already morbid sister Fallen London, but its no less delightful. The Unterzee is awash with clever, well-written stories, and youre sure to find something new every time you set sail  even if actually finding it can take a while. If you enjoy weird horror with a dark comedic bent, or if youre in the mood for a roguelike that focuses on economics and politics (albeit very strange politics) over more standard fantasy themes, then this will keep you occupied for hours on end. Youll get even more out of it if you play Fallen London, as Failbetter games is constantly releasing new story content that ties the two games together.", "date": "March 3, 2015", "grade": 4.0}
