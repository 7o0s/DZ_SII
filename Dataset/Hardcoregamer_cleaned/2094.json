{"name": "Europa Universalis IV: Wealth of Nations", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=90087", "text": "Wealth of Nations is the second major DLC offering for Europa Universalis IV, adding a number of features and interface enhancements to what was, already on release, one of the deepest games of grand strategy on the market. State directed piracy, East India Companies and massive geography altering construction projects in the form of the Suez, Kiel and Panama canals are the meat and potatoes of this DLC pack, with alterations of the interface, trade and religion systems thrown in for good measure. There is also a new policy system that works similarly to the national decisions system but requires two specific idea trees to be completely filled and costs monarch points per month to maintain. The interface could probably use a little more work overall, but the new changes certainly make the game easier to play. The major additions add strategic layers to the game and, when combined with the games original depth of strategy, give the player numerous new complex strategies with which to experiment. Piracy is a great example of this; it allows you to keep your large rivals in check by crippling their trade. Of course your rivals arent going to like this and might go to war to wipe out your pirate fleet and teach you a lesson. However, perhaps this is exactly what you wanted them to do Wealth of Nations reflects two important themes that seem to influence EU4s ongoing development. The first is making the late game more interesting. Trading companies certainly give the player a new way to think about their far-flung imperial acquisitions, allowing regions to become completely focused on trade rather than generating tax dollars and cannon fodder for your next war. The new canal mega-projects also add much to the late game. Your rivals conquered Africa, did they? Why not build the Suez canal (after youve saved up an ungodly amount of money) and change the geography of the planet with major economic and military repercussions? The second trend has been to make every country in every time period an interesting, unique and enjoyable experience.Wealth of Nations tweaks some existing religions and adds new religions, which creates a unique flavor for certain countries as well as the potential for conflict between neighbors. For instance, Ethiopia now has its own religion that it may want to hold on to; other countries have religions that combine the traditions of their local faiths while trying not to provoke any of their neighbors with those slight differences in beliefs that can cause centuries of destructive conflict. The changes to Hinduism reflect the benefits of polytheism; instead of one big God that does everything, there are many gods with different stories and approaches to problems and you can choose the right god for you. From trade to religion, Wealth of Nations demonstrates that competition can be a very useful thing. Closing Comments:", "date": "June 17, 2014", "grade": 4.5}
