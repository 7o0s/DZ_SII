{"name": "BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=79990", "text": "It seems to me we dont really expect much of fighting games. So long as theres a large roster of characters and a solid combat system, the likes of Street Fighter can get away with having few modes and almost no story to speak of. Some would argue that such features are superfluous, that single-player modes cant prepare you for human opponents, and that aside, the stories of these games are always third-rate. The BlazBlue series challenges all of these assumptions, and in-so-doing puts almost every other fighting game on the market to shame.In most fighting games, the story amounts to a few bits of dialogue before certain battles in a generic fighting tournament. BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma has an arcade mode like that, but its just a prequel to the events of the story mode proper. Chrono Phantasma has enough lore and dialogue to fill a novel, a visual novel to be specific. The games story mode plays out as an extravagant VN intercut with frequent bouts of fisticuffs. It tells an intricate and, frankly, crazy tale of magic, time travel, mind control, and ninjas that I dont have space to even begin explaining here. Fortunately, the Teach Me, Miss Litchi mode will summarize the series lore for you in a hilariously condescending fashion. Suffice it to say, depending on your appreciation of/tolerance for anime tropes, youll either adore it or despise it. Aksys, as usual, has done a great job of translating the massive script, and their voiceover cast is fantastic (though the lady they picked as the default announcer is a little bland).The story modes actually been pared down considerably from previous BlazBlues. Past games had condensed visual novel stories for each individual character, with the path of the story determined by dialogue choices and whether you won or lost each fight. Progress in some stories could only be made by getting further in others, creating an intriguing web of cause and effect. In Chrono Phantasma that web has been more or less untangled. The plot has been split into three linear routes starring different groups of characters, and the only choices you get to make are between continuing the story and watching a gag ending (which are all fantastic, by the way.) This is better-suited to the story Arc System Works is trying to tell, but compared to how open previous games were its a little disappointing.If youd rather not sit through 20 minute cutscenes between every fight, Chronophantasma offers plenty of other challenges for you to face. Outside the standard arcade, boss rush, and training modes, you have Abyss Mode and Unlimited Mars Mode. Abyss is an odd sort of dungeon-crawling RPG experience that challenges you to fight foe after foe with only one health bar. Winning allows you to raise character stats and earn cash that you can spend on further stat boosts or unlockable art and character palettes. Unlimited Mars Mode challenges you to fight through 10 unlimited (in other words, boss-mode) characters with hell mode AI. Theres also a challenge mode that tasks you with completing increasingly intricate attack combos. All-told, the game offers plenty of ways to bone up on your skills for competition.It must be said that navigating between all these modes is smooth and pleasant as can be. Arc System Works has an unrivaled knack for interface design, as anyone whos played Persona 4 arena can attest, and theyve pulled out all the stops here. Everythings neatly organized and easy to find, and its all done up with great visual flair. By far the neatest menu is the virtual lobby, which allows you to wander around a little arcade hub (using any character from the game as an avatar) and pick fights with people on your local server. My only complaint about the games interface is that the game has an odd aspect ratio, and the default display setting cuts off a bit of visual info. Fortunately, its possible to switch the display in the menu in order to get the whole picture.Much as I love all of these features, everything still comes down to the fighting. Fortunately, thats where Chrono Phantasma really excels. If youre not familiar with it, BlazBlue uses a 4-button combat system  for light, medium, heavy, and drive attacks  with the last button being its most unique feature. Each characters drive attack gives them a unique mechanic  leeching health, freezing or magnetizing enemies, and controlling the wind are just a few examples  that differentiates them beyond standard deviations in play style. The game is a very fast and stylish affair, similar in its over-the-top tone to Marvel vs Capcom 2. It finds a comfortable middle ground between Arc System Works heavily technical Guilty Gear series and their more accessible Persona 4 Arena, providing both a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling.From a mechanical perspective, not much has changed since Continuum Shift Extend. There have been balance tweaks across the board, of course, but dont expect a full mechanical overhaul. What has changed is the way guard crushes and bursts are handled. Instead of whittling down your opponents stock of guard primers in order to break their defense, you can now use 25% of your Heat (special meter) to perform a one-time crush.Bursting is a mechanic that allows players to break almost any combo once per round, knocking the opponent away in the process. In previous games, bursts could be used aggressively to cancel into combos and knock enemies around, but in Chrono Phantasma using a burst when youre not under attack triggers your characters overdrive instead. Overdrives freeze the match timer and boost your characters stats for 5 seconds, while also giving them access to new moves. If you use the Overdrive at lower health, it can last up to 15 seconds. Both bursts and overdrives are now fueled by a gauge that fills up over time, rather than being doled out in limited stock.When you boot the game up, there are 24 characters available to play, four of whom are new to this entry in the series. Azrael is a heavyweight scientist whose research skills include punching things really hard (he can shatter your arm with a gentle pat) and also sometimes kicking them. Amane Nishiki is an androgynous traveling dancer with a predilection for young men and boys whose scarf turns into a guard-piercing drill. Bullet is an agile soldier with a big attitude and bigger tracts of land whose drive allows her to instantly rush at any enemy in range and grab them. Izayoi is a robot lady who can build up power charges using weak attacks and then expend them for stronger, more combo-ready abilities.On top of these four characters, there are 3 that can be unlocked, although in this day and age of digital distribution that term takes on a slightly different meaning. Kagura Mutsuki, a wealthy aristocrat with a huge-ass sword, becomes playable once you beat story mode or fork over a bit of cash to the games online store. Yuki Terumi and Kokonoe, on the other hand, can only be purchased as DLC. No add-ons are currently available on the PSN store, but having played the Japanese version I can attest that they make solid additions to the cast.What sets BlazBlue apart as a series is that, even as the roster grows, you wont find a single clone in the mix. Each character has their own distinct playstyle and move set, and theyre further distinguished by their drives. You can play with a friend for hours upon hours and never run into the same matchup twice. The characters are also very visually distinctive, from the No-Face-like Arakune to the bouncy catgirl Taokaka to the Hellboyish Iron Tager. In the whole roster, only Terumi and Hazama share a significant number of animations (on account of kind of being the same person), but they differ so greatly in terms of mobility and move-set that you can hardly tell.Chronophantasmas story is set on a more global scale than previous games, and to reflect that most of the backgrounds from those titles have been scrapped. BlazBlue has always had an impressive set of 3D-rendered arenas, and this game is no exception. From train stations to ninja cities to coliseums, theres quite a bit of variety. On top of that, a lot of stages have little stories that play out between the spectators in the background. Its a nice touch for elements that mostly go unnoticed. Oddly, most of the stages from previous games are still on the disk and are used for fights in story mode, but for some reason they cant be used in versus.Perhaps the biggest update to Chronophantasma is also the least noticeable. All 20 of the returning characters have had their sprites redrawn and their theme songs remixed. The series already had some of the most impressive sprite animations in the business, and a bit of visual polish only improves that. The changes are really only noticeable with Noel, whos been given an entirely new wardrobe to reflect the changes her character has undergone over the course of the story. As shes my main Im somewhat attached to her old army/librarian getup, but I really dig her more open, badass redesign.Arc System Works is one of the rockin-est fighting studios out there, and I mean that quite literally. Their games feature some of the most awesome hard rock soundtracks youll find anywhere. The tracks do a hell of a job getting you pumped, but they also help to define each fighters personality. Every character has at least one catchy and memorable theme song, and for Chronophantasma almost all of them have been revamped. The new mixes feature more guitar riffs and heavier drums than ever before, lending each fight a bit of added intensity. Each new character has their own theme that can match the old classics beat for beat. This is one of the best soundtracks in the genre, rivaled only by Arcs other games.Closing Comments:", "date": "March 30, 2014", "grade": 4.5}
