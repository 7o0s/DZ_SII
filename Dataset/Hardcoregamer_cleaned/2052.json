{"name": "Point Perfect", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=94308", "text": "In an age where touchpads, tablets and even game controllers are taking over PC gaming, there are still genres that take the tried and tested mouse seriously. Veteran FPS players will laugh at those who prefer a Xbox 360 pad over the razor-sharp precision of the mouse, and you simply cant substitute for a reliable mouse when youre seriously into RTS games. Point Perfect is an indie game that reinforces the importance of the mouse in PC gaming, and more importantly it values proper and precise usage of it. Just as the name of the title suggests, Point Perfect pushes you to become a perfectionist when it comes to maneuvering the mouse cursor. It does have some degree of consistency in its design and structure, but as you play it over and over you appreciate that is essentially pure chaos, throwing a series of random events and exercises at you designed to give your mouse a serious workout.From the outset, Point Perfect has the exterior of a shmup, especially in terms of its scrolling, enemy types, patterns and the almost shmup-like bosses complete with bullet hell patterns. Even the mouse cursor itself serves as a spaceship of sorts, but this is where Point Perfect becomes an entirely different beast. The mouse is used to highlight a region which essentially represents a selection box; enemies and projectiles that fall within the range of the selection get locked-on which then prompts the mother-ship to blast them to bits. The length and width of the selection box is limited; green denotes an acceptable selection range and red when the limit is surpassed. Power-ups can be collected to increase the range and power of selections, and other support items can replenish a life, activate score multipliers and unleash bombs. In essence, Point Perfect looks and somewhat feels like a shmup, but plays nothing like one in terms of core gameplay mechanic. As all you have to do is move the mouse cursor around, the game may sound easy on paper, but its a whole different ball game in practice. Point Perfect will make you overly conscious of how you use your mouse because the mouse cursor itself is the (highly sensitive) hit box, making it easy to ram into enemies and projectiles as youre highlighting things and moving around. Losing a life is always your fault, so it all really comes down to a steady hand. Point Perfect not only gives your mouse a workout, but also puts your motor skills to test.It looks casual and friendly  and its certainly designed for fun short bursts of play  but the difficulty and challenge is strictly hardcore. Its punishing and the developer isnt shy to admit it. It will make fun of failures by name-calling and, to add further insult to injury, gives the most blatantly sarcastic gameplay tips. For example, it suggested that I should press the Escape key, quit and go cry in a corner. Suffice it to say, its well aware of how unkind it is as it shows no sympathy to struggling playersThe design can be described by two words: chaos and randomness. A variety of different challenges are thrown at you: theres typical enemy encounters, random mini-games which involve activities like playing baseball, and some tight maze-like obstacle courses that must be carefully navigated. Theres a huge cast of devious bosses too, and ton of variety in their design and patterns. Brutal and highly rewarding, boss battles stand out the most as even coming close to defeating one feels like a major feat. The randomness, on the other hand, becomes clear when playing over and over as there is virtually no consistency in terms of enemy types, enemy patterns, mini-games and even bosses. Preparing or memorizing is nearly impossible, and even practice wont save you theres always some curve-ball with even the most subtle deviation throwing you off.Even with the high difficulty, Point Perfect never forgets that a game should always be fun, and so while it will make you shout more Doh!s per second than most games, it doesnt discourage replay. All failures experienced are under your control at the end of the day. With a steady hand and better command over muscle reaction and movement, you will slowly but surely get better at the game. If anything, it feels like a military training for mouse usage.Visually, it boasts a fun and colorful aesthetic, harking back to the days of early DOS gaming. The visuals, in particular the boss designs, have their charm as you go up against a giant nerdy octopus, space ninja and even the racket from Pong. The little cutscenes that insult you are all in good humor and nicely animated.Closing Comments:", "date": "July 17, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
