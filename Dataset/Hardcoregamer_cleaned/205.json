{"name": "The Inpatient", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=287720", "text": "Supermassive Games has spent that last few years focusing on VR games and the horror genre, both to positive results. Theyve become linked with their surprise 2015 hit Until Dawn, an often terrifying choose-your-own-adventure horror game that kept gamers engaged and invested over its well-paced (though appropriately brief) campaign. The Inpatient, a PlayStation VR prequel set sixty years prior to the events of Until Dawn, is none of those things.The Inpatient establishes a menacing tone upfront, with the player character strapped to a chair, being interrogated by a strange doctor about their case of amnesia. What ensues is an underwhelming hodgepodge of half-baked ideas and a sluggishly-paced story. The player will experience long bouts of sitting in a lonely cell in the Blackwood Pine Sanatorium (a location well-known to fans of Until Dawn) with intermittent moments of exploration and intriguing psychologically twisted segments. The rest of The Inpatients two-hour playtime leaves this cell behind and allows the player to make an escape attempt alongside fearful doctors and nurses, all while finding out just how this character ended up in an insane asylum in the first place.Like many VR games, The Inpatient decides to keep action light and focuses on mild exploration and interactive elements. There are 21 items that can be examined to uncover brief memories of the player character and six Butterfly Effect moments that change the course of the narrative based on player decisions. Each decision in the game, major or minor, is comprised of two options. Most decisions are lines of dialogue, backed by a general tone of voice (like aggressive or understanding) that can either be selected manually with a simple button press or said into the PlayStation VRs microphone to further immerse the player into the world. This vocal response system works well, as the game didnt misunderstand any spoken lines, though with every decision being two simple options, the functionality comes off as ultimately unnecessary.The Inpatient offers two controller options: players can use a DualShock 4 or two PlayStation Move controllers. With the DualShock 4, the player character moves like a tank, only able to walk backwards or forwards with the left stick while the right stick shifts the players horizontal perspective by set increments. Holding down the R2 button allows the player to interact with certain objects, almost all of which can be moved around and examined to elicit one of the 21 collectable memories. The PlayStation Move setup lets the player walk forward when the left Move button is held down and the right controller steers the character left or right. As can be expected, the motion control set-up interacts better with the environment and is preferable if players have two Move controllers laying around. This walking boils down to slow, tedious trudges through environments  its as if the player character is attempting to make their way through shallow mud, even during moments in the game that would naturally elicit quicker progression. Movement is exceptionally difficult to design in VR games, and though this slowness is likely a measure to counteract motion sickness, it bogs the games already sluggish pacing to a complete halt.Though PlayStation VR isnt the most powerful gaming VR unit available, Supermassive Games has done an excellent job bringing the Blackwood Pine Sanatorium to life with an admirable attention to environmental details, well-articulated character models and a masterful grasp on how to make VR run well with little-to-no motion sickness. Blood pools on the floor, shining with a deep red reflection. Objects are detailed and crisp, lacking the extreme jaggy qualities that VR is known for producing. Characters look fantastic, with realistic skin textures, hair and more. Unfortunately, these things arent particularly prevalent: the game often comes across as hollow and barren, with items sparsely placed throughout the environments, and there are relatively few characters in the plot until the last chunk of the game. The Inpatient was clearly made from the ground up for PlayStation VR, and Supermassive Games continues to show that they know how to handle the technology and are honing their craft of immersing players in a world of virtual reality.The Inpatients story is far more effective if the player has played through Until Dawn first, as it helps explain and flesh out the backstory of much of the original game. The plot has a few twists in store, but there are major logical gaps in character motivation and narrative flow. Though the player should be invested in finding out the main characters true identity, the amnesia backdrop feels warn out. Supporting characters offer little pull to the story, even if they are well-performed all around. Dialogue and interplay between characters works to a degree, but without a steady narrative drive underpinning it, most of it fades from memory quicker than a guy with amnesia forgets his own name.Story is paramount in a game like The Inpatient, but what it boils down to is a boring, two-hour slog through a poorly paced, generally predictable, humorless and altogether stereotypical horror narrative. Its worth noting, however, that the games story has multiple permutations, and after just two playthroughs its clear that those Butterfly Effect moments really do have a significant impact on how the story plays out. Will you be difficult or comply with the scary doctor? Will you trust your roommate or turn on him (or her, if thats the direction your story plays out)? These arent necessarily difficult decisions, but they do have lasting consequences for the remainder of the short story. This allows for a decent amount of replay-ability, provided the player has the patience to sit through another round of the narrative.Though The Inpatient is labeled as a psychological horror game, genuine scares are few and far between. The game establishes an ominous tone from the outset, and though there are twisted segments where the player cant entirely tell whats real and what isnt, theres never any palpable sense of danger or dread. One or two jump-scares creep into the game, but even in a fully immersive VR experience, they dont generate fear on any significant level. The game is self-serious and though a little humor can often interrupt an atmosphere of terror, The Inpatient could have used some tonal variety to keep things interesting. Dripping blood and scaly monsters arent quite enough to make hearts race with fear throughout this game.What all of this ultimately adds up to is a disappointing experience that feels like a missed opportunity. There are brief moments of brilliance that tap into the potential of VR, like a sequence where the player must keep their head as still as possible to avoid being attacked by a monster. But for every interesting moment, there are twice as many that feel unnecessarily monotonous. The game nails its tone and graphical fidelity, but neither of those matter much when the game simply isnt very fun to play. It ran smoothly for the most part, but we did encounter a minor bug that caused a character to remain at the foot of some stairs instead of flipping a switch to move the plot forward. Loading the most recent save only cost a few extra minutes before the story continued without this problem, however, and the plot went on its merry way. If Supermassive Games continues down the VR path  which they should, given their mastery of the hardware  theyd do well to inject more of the energy and novel ideas present in Until Dawn into their next outing. Closing Comments:The Inpatients short duration and lack of entertainment value doesnt warrant its forty dollar price tag. For fans of Until Dawn, it does a decent job of filling in important information prior to the events of the original game. For everyone else, its a dull experience that never quite feels like its going anywhere worthwhile. Horror and VR are a natural fit, but with The Inpatient, its clear that the pairing doesnt always work quite the way it should.", "date": "January 25, 2018", "grade": 2.5}
