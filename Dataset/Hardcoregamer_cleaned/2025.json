{"name": "Lovely Planet", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=97807", "text": "Its always sad to look at a game and see an appealing style applied to fast-paced arcade FPS action, only to find that its just not any fun at all. Lovely Planet is a speed-run FPS set on floating platforms decorated in a whimsical style using flat-shaded polygons for a Katamari Damacy-style look, and its upbeat music plus pleasantly bizarre scenario makes it an instant charmer. Then the speed run aspect kicks in, killing you dead if you slow down anywhere the game decides you shouldnt, and the constant endless prodding artificially rushes you into making the next mistake. Why learn a level by observation and hone your skills on it with voluntary practice when Lovely Planet can kill you dead and force a level restart instead? The progression from fun to ooh, tricky! to annoying to What the hell is wrong with this thing!? to quitting out is gradual, but almost inevitable.Lovely Planet is a pure arcade FPS focusing on speed and accuracy, with no plot but rather a series of micro-levels that only take a few seconds to clear when done properly. Death is quick and a single hit sets you back to levels beginning, but its an instantaneous transition so the loss isnt initially that bad. Repeat ten times in a row and it gets old fast, however, and around the middle of world two its easy to see that many attempts or more at running the levels gauntlet. Get hit by a bullet, fall off the world, or touch anything red and its an instant restart, but eventually rote memorization will see you through to reaching the flagpole at levels end.There are a couple of factors making this harder, however. First off, you dont have an aiming reticle. This is actually one of the more interesting design decisions in Lovely Planet, honestly, and a bit of practice will see you making shots without even thinking about it. Bullets take time to fly across the level, so timing is important, but it doesnt take long before lining up a shot becomes almost instinctual. Its a good mechanic that would have been better used in a game less about speed and accuracy.You can earn up to three stars on beating a level in Lovely Planet, and while you dont have to earn them all on a single run it seems silly not to take the endless repetition of die/restart as an opportunity to practice. The first star is for killing all the enemies, and you havent actually beaten the level until youve earned this one. Star number two is for beating a predetermined level-clear speed, and star the third is for accuracy. As in, 100% accuracy. Waste a single shot and that star isnt happening. What this means is that, while the magic star-wand you wield in your cartoon-gloved hand can fire as fast as you can click the mouse button, most of the time youll be rationing out the shots one by one with utmost care. Miss a shot and, while its still possible to beat the level, the knowledge that Lovely Planet thinks less of you makes victory feel far less victorious. The lack of aiming reticle plus speed-running plus an accuracy grade makes for a frustrating combination, and it doesnt help that the game is constantly pushing you forward.The first few levels are easy enough, getting you up to speed with Lovely Planets style, but then come the apples. Most enemies just sit there, some firing while others being little more than a target or a hazard you dont want to touch, but the apples are different. The apples pop into the air when you get within range, and while they arent a threat in the same way getting shot by one of the square red guys would be theyre actually more dangerous. If you dont shoot the apple out of the air than when it hits the ground it counts as level failure and an instant restart. It doesnt take long for Lovely Planet to chain apples together, so by the time you get in range to shoot the first the next has popped. Later levels replace them with different devices like electrodes that you need to get out of range before they go off, and while its nice not to have to calculate their arc to shoot them out of the air, theres enemies firing homing bullets and creeping red slimes to deal with by then. Its not enough to know the clock is ticking and any missed shot counts against you, Lovely Planet needs to be constantly pushing as well. That doesnt stay fun for long.
