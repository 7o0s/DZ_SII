{"name": "Sadame", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=195857", "text": "Apparently, Koei had it wrong this entire time with their long running series. Nobunagas ambition was not to unify Japan under his rule using a mixture of iron-handed politics and warfare. Instead, it was to foster a demon invasion. Fortunately, Rising Star Japan has stepped forward to set the historical record right with Sadame. Its about time somebody did.This downloadable 3DS title centers around a hero in his quest to squelch the demon uprising, bring peace to the land and enjoy a side dish of vengeance along the way. There are four character classes from which to choose. The samurai is the sword swinging murder machine. The ninja is quicker and uses traps to disable foes. There is a monk that can attack long range with a staff. Finally, the rogue fills out her attacks with polearms and bows. While this isnt the most original set of characters, they each feel different enough in play to encourage some experimentation. This basic experimentation pays off in what seems to be the coolest feature. As each character is leveled up, they can be used as support heroes during other characters runs. So, even if a play through is aborted due to not liking the class, the time isnt wasted since they can still lend a hand during other campaigns. These will be needed as players try to conquer the more difficult campaigns. Other support characters can be found by using Streetpass, but come on, what are the chances of that occurring during day to day travel?This game also contains a decent equipment system. As expected during an action RPG, as enemies fall and chests and crates are broken open, equipment and gems will be found. These wont be identified until the level ends. Afterwards, the player can equip upgrades and socket the gems, assuming the shapes of the slots in the equipment match. Still, going with the items that have the best stats isnt advisable. For the most part, the major skills are attached to the items themselves. Therefore, some careful consideration must be given before dropping the item that has the screen clearing wave attack in favor of a couple of extra defense points. Bad item choices arent the end of the world here. Its simply impossible to get stuck. Even if a level is failed, the experience gained on the aborted attempt is saved. So, brute forcing through a stage is simply a matter of perseverance. This furthers the design focus on not wasting the players time, which is appreciated. Failure only means being that much stronger on the next try.All of this is done with a really well done 16-bit design. The enemies all have some personality. The centipede ones in particular are drawn well enough to make me squirm. (Hate those things.) The highlight are the bosses. These giant, screen filling demons have loads of detail. The squirming guts underneath the skeletons rib cage or an aggravated look another foe takes before summoning underlings to defend it give these things some real personality. Moving forward just to see the next boss kept me playing.All of this is just covering the window dressing, and putting off the inevitable topic of the actual gameplay. This is the most important thing to get right in this type of game and this is where Sadame falls flat. The fighting just doesnt have the chops needed to carry the game. Through huge swaths of the title, the most useful way to progress is using the starting combo for each character. The skills and additional combos earned just are not useful in most situations. Trying to use a spell leaves the player open for a ridiculous pummeling. As there is no invincibility window, its possible to become stun locked and dropped in a matter of seconds, even when playing an over powered character. Thus, trying to use anything but straight attacks is basically pointless.All of this leaves the game feeling like GBAs Dynasty Warriors Advance without the pointless strategy portions that title possessed. It uses the same retro looking overhead beat em up style. The player follows the path. When entering the next section, enemies spawn. Only when they stop spawning can the player progress. If the actual battles had a meatier feel to them, this would be fine. Final Fight is still awesome. But this isnt Final Fight.Closing Comments:Sadame isnt a terrible game by any stretch. Obvious attention was paid to get all the action/RPG trappings in place to create a deep experience. Everywhere, that is, except where it really counts. Attempting to use anything but one combo throughout this game isnt a sound choice. Trying anything else is a recipe for frustration. Its possible that some folks would be alright with this, but there are so many better options available.", "date": "Bohn on March 3, 2016", "grade": 3.0}
