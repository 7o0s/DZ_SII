{"name": "Dungeonland", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=28268", "text": "From Critical Studios and Paradox Interactive comes Dungeonland, a rather humble little dungeon-crawler in the vein of Gauntlet, or something else where players hack up gobs of baddies in exchange for succulent amounts of loot and treasure. Filled to the brim with mindless fun, death-dealing encounters and a shedload of zaniness, this hack and slash, RPG-lite extravaganza has a little bit of everything, except a meaningful single-player experience. For $9.99, though, do the pros outweigh the cons?Lets have a look-see. At first glance, one might assume Dungeonland is a somewhat shallow game that lacks any type of substantial depth. Actually, that assumption would be fairly accurate. Despite being part of a genre that is known for its intricate and deep gameplay filled with loads and loads of stat points, min-maxing and pouring over item screens to see which weapon best suits a characters role, Dungeonland doesnt ever concern itself with being overly complex. In truth, thats why the game works so well. Although this is a dungeon crawler by all definitions, its not your average RPG. It forgoes profundity to focus on sheer enjoyment, and succeeds wildly at it. This is mostly due to how the game is setup.Dungeonland tasks players with traversing giant labyrinths, all of which are part of a much larger medieval theme park. In said amusement park, there are various areas players must tackle. Each of the stages that are offered, have their own specific theme  usually something rather absurd, such as Arcane Kingdom, which is described in-game as an area that captures the enchantment of fairy tales with exciting murder, exploding frogs, extraplanar monsters and so much more. In each stage, there are area-specific monsters and bosses, all of which are not afraid to hand you your ass without so much as a second thought. Thus, make no mistake, this is a hard game, and you will die. Its so challenging that an easy or normal mode doesnt even exist; the first difficulty level you can choose is simply entitled, hard and then moves to harder and finally impossible. Thats right, this game was designed to test ones will to persevere, and to test the durability of household keyboards, seeing as players will most certainly slam theirs fist down on them several times in response to the take-no-prisoners level of challenge.Thankfully, those greiving need not be alone in their suffering since Dungeonland is a game best experienced by, and clearly designed for, being in the company of fellow human players. Teaming together and going at the wily dungeons not only makes the tasks a smidge easier, but exponentially more enjoyable, especially with four people. Objectives will require the help of ones fellow compatriots, and theres nothing more satisfying than banding together to share a moment of sweet, sweet, hard-earned victory as a single unit  a real one for all and all for one moment, indeed. Combos will be made in conjunction with fellow warriors throughout the dungeon spelunking, making the taste of glory go down all the easier with friends in tow. In truth, Dungeonland is at its best when there are multiple players involved. This presents a problem, however, considering that single-player feels like a total throwaway experience. Fortunately, the online component is without noticeable blemishes, so if you dont have any friends at the ready, theres a world of angry teenagers and trolls just waiting to play alongside you.That being said, when firing up Dungeonland for the first time, one might be immediately stricken with a sense that the game is a bit light on features. But this is the type of game that opens up the more time players spend with it. For example, at the start of the adventure, there are only three character types to choose from; however, over time, as players lay waste to minions and collect the coins they drop, they can then spend the acquired currency to unlock new sub-classes. Even outside of these character jobs, there are new items, weapons, armor and the like to unlock and equip as well, making this the type of experience that encourages replaying stages over and over to get the most out of it.To replay stages, though, really just means players will be thrust into hours upon hours of combat. The battling in Dungeonland epitomizes the word, rudimentary, with the game only divvying out a handful of attacks per person. Because of this, the combat isnt all that profound, and without fail, players will find themselves mashing the same keys without much change-up. Regardless, this simplistic design generally fits the feel of the game, which is all about providing a sort of Mario Party-inspired experience that never limits ones fun by implementing gratuitously involved mechanics or character options. No less, it can grow a bit mundane over time, simply because theres not a lot of variety. But the aforementioned joining up of buddies for the sake of friendly mockery and the slaughtering of everything in sight, remedies this flaw quickly.Dungeonland isnt just about killing all the things with friends; its also about pitting minions against them to make their life as miserable as possible in its spectacular dungeon master-esque mode entitled, Dungeon Maestro. How appropriate of a title, I might add. Here, players play the lord of the dungeon and essentially set up all the adventures scenarios, monsters, items, and whatnot to thwart the heroes advance. By oneself, this isnt all that exciting, however, like everything else the game offers, in the company of friends its a riot. Playing dungeon master and purposefully dicking over buddies is more satisfying than I care to admit. In fact, the Dungeon Maestro mode may be worth the price of admission by itself  its that satisfying.That aside, if players are looking for something outside of this senseless kind of gameplay, like a poignant narrative, they wont find it here. The story in Dungeonland is barebones and as close to nonexistent, without being nonexistent, as humanly possible. So, dont expect Pulitzer Prize stuff. Yet again, however, this is a game that is most concerned with giving folks a streamlined, jump in and out experience, and a story would only hold it back from being so accessible. For that reason alone, the lack of a narrative is, in this case, welcomed.Whats rather unwelcomed is the games performance. Although the system requirements appear quite reasonable, and in fact are rather low, the game chugs and hiccups more than it should. On a top-of-the-line rig, I was experiencing strange framerate issues that I dont at all with some of the most graphically-demanding games around. This is tragic too, considering this is a skill-oriented game in terms of the need for accuracy and landing blow-by-blow to damage enemies; theres no sitting back, targeting, and hitting an ability that automatically finds its target. With the need to be precise in ones assault, the framerate stuttering is frustrating and rather shocking. Whats most strange is the fact that all of this is happening, even though Dungeonland is hardly a graphical powerhouse. Actually, its not all that easy on eyes in general. Its aesthetics arent bad per se, but merely middle-of-the-road and without grand creativity. The same goes for the sound and overall presentation.Closing Comments", "date": "February 2, 2013", "grade": 4.0}
