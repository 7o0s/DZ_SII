{"name": "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy", "ref": "https://hardcoregamer.com/?post_type=post&p=122353", "text": "Replaying Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a lot like re-reading a good book. You know all the beats  sometimes by heart  but the dialogue is as charming and entertaining as it ever was, and there are new details you pick up a second or even third time through that enrich the tale. The Ace Attorney games released on DS are ports of now decade-old GBA carts, though, and despite being well-optimized, theyre starting to show their age. If youre looking to replay the original games, or if you jumped into the series with Apollo Justice or Dual Destinies and need to catch up, then Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy offers a near-ideal way to enjoy the classics.Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, as the title suggests, is a remastered compilation of the first three entries in Capcoms acclaimed visual novel series. It brings the games from DS to 3DS with redrawn HD sprites and backgrounds taken from the games iPad port and layered with some simple stereoscopic trickery. The redrawn anime-style assets look gorgeous, and on a more compact screen they dont have the same problem as they did on iPad  namely looking sluggish due to the low frame count of their animations. The 3D effect usually works well, creating the impression of a popup book, except in the detention centers visiting room where the developers didnt bother (or were possibly unable) to put the window frame on a separate layer. This isnt a huge problem, but it is distracting, and it crops up often as you need to visit the detention center at least once per case.In a market full of knights, space marines, and super fighting robots, it seems ludicrous to release a game about a lawyer, but this isnt some mundane Law& Order style procedural. Phoenix Wright lives in a world gone mad, where phantom thieves and spirit mediums are commonplace and dew process refers exclusively to how water clings to grass in the early morning. Preliminary trials in this world last only three days and almost always end in a guilty verdict  a little distressing given the police forces tendency to arrest the first suspicious person they see at a crime scene. As a result Wrights legal battles are fast-paced, pulse-pounding affairs full of colorful characters and insane twists.This craziness makes the series cases immensely entertaining, but I think it resonates on a deeper level than simple madcap fun. Despite how out-there the setting (Las Angeles circa 2016 in the localized version) seems, the problems it presents are very grounded in reality. Shu Takumi created the first game as a biting satire of the Japanese Legal System in which the only way a defense attorney can hope to win an acquittal is by identifying the true culprit and proving THEM guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. Over a decade since that games release, with high-profile failures in western legal systems cropping up year after year, Takumis tales of dangerously inept cops and corrupt governments are as relevant as they ever were.While that satirical bent is an important part of the series, Takumi never lets it get in the way of telling a good story. The games are broken up into five episodes apiece, each one a more-or-less self-contained mystery. These disparate events are tied together with a thread of light but compelling character drama that gives the games their heart. Unlike the protagonists of many visual novels, Phoenix Wright has personality to spare  hes cynical but kind, he always believes in his clients, and while he can be impressively confident hes far from immune to bouts of nervousness. Hes assisted by Maya Fey, an eccentric spirit medium in training with a predilection for Samurai Sentai shows and a bottomless stomach. Their banter is some of the best in gaming, up there with Nico Collard and George Stobbart.Wrights childhood friend and present rival Miles Edgeworth makes for a great character foil, and his arc over the course of these games is arguably the most compelling part of their stories. Detective Dick Gumshoe is almost always at Edgeworths side, though it doesnt do either of them much good  his comedic bumbling often causes serious trouble for the prosecution, which is just as unfortunate for him since Edgeworth dictates his salary. In addition to Edgeworth each game in the series pits Phoenix against a different prosecutor, and they all make for great antagonists in their own right, and they all abuse the defense in delightfully evil ways. If I had to pick one as a favorite, Id go with the mysterious caffeine-addict Godot from Trials and Tribulations, who hurls his coffee mug at Wrights head whenever he raises a serious objection.The three games episodes are largely standalone mysteries  and quite good ones at that, with plenty of Eureka! moments that come as you solve them  but Takumi wisely integrates them into a single overarching plot. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney focuses on the mysterious DL-6 incident, while Trials and Tribulations (the third entry) is all built around a single delightfully maniacal villain. The second game, Justice for All, is the exception to this rule  not just in this trilogy but across the whole series. Save for its second episode, everything in it is pointless filler, and the writing isnt nearly as funny as the filler episodes in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney or Trials and Tribulations. If this is your first time playing, Id recommend skipping the second half of Justice for All entirely  it was rushed out the door just a year after the first game shipped, and it really shows. By comparison Takumi had a full two years to work on the third game, and with its tightly-woven mystery its arguably the best game in the entire series.Justice for All even disappoints in the music department, which is where the rest of the series shines brightest. Akemi Kimuras tracks are still decent, but they feel boring and uninspired compared to Masazaku Sugimoris compositions for the first game or Noriyuki Iwadares work on Trials and Tribulations. Even the best music in the game is a bit of a disappointment though, as it still sounds the same as it did way back on the Game Boy Advance. There was an opportunity here to rework the series songs for new hardware  possibly including tracks from the orchestra and jazz arrangement CDs released by Capcom a few years back  but sadly the graphics are the only part of the games thats gotten an upgrade. The only original song in the package is the title theme, a fantastic medley of tunes from all three games that Ive already set as my new ringtone.The series greatest hallmark has always been its audio design  the original games made better use of the GBAs infamously awful sound chip than anything else on the system. As I said, the music is phenomenal, but its the other sound work that really steals the show. Effects like the explosive bang of the judges gavel help to set a dramatic tone, and different pitches of bleeps and bloops accompany each characters dialogue boxes to give them a distinct voice. And of course the iconic cries of OBJECTION! accompanied by intense word balloons give the courtroom action a bit of extra kick. We dont often think about it, but sound design is immensely important in visual novels  the creaks and groans of the ship in 999 do so much for that games atmosphere  and Ace Attorney Trilogy nails it.Closing Comments:", "date": "December 9, 2014", "grade": 4.0}
