There are indeed a lot of dating sims, as well as romance-focused titles, but theres nothing weird about that. Those arent the only things that exist in the realm of visual novels, however. Just like with actual books, there are a wealth of genres to choose from. Sound of Drop  fall into poison  is not a cutesy high school romance. It is a gripping, disturbing tale of horror which takes place within an aquarium. As such, those who arent particularly interested in the lovey-dovey types of visual novels may find that this is a game more suited to their tastes  even if theyve never played a visual novel before. First, lets set the scene for this horrific visual novel. Everything starts out normal enough as were introduced to two best friends: Mayu and Himeno. Theyre your average high schoolers simply chatting about what theyre going to do in their free time. Himeno is a bit of a paranormal fan and suggests they head to the Manten Aquarium. According to rumors passed throughout the student body, this location is filled with all sorts of paranormal activity (alongside more serious things like unexplained disappearances and deaths). Supposedly, there are things like a fish with a human face and that the aquarium water turns to blood on full moons. Guess what? A full moon is right around the corner! Mayu wants nothing to do with the Manten Aquarium, though she doesnt actually voice this discomfort to Himeno. It appears that theres some secret shes keeping about the whole thing But in either case, the two teens head off to the aquarium to discover the truth behind the rumors. After all, Mayus discomfort isnt enough of a reason to ignore hanging out with her best friend. Besides, none of these rumors could actually turn out to be in any way true, right? As is common to Japanese supernatural horror, both girls will discover that these tales are not only real but far worse than they ever could have imagined. The turn from bubbly schoolgirl fun to absolute terror is sudden and immensely creepy.Some folks out there tend to have a dislike for visual novels right out of the gate because they find that simply reading a ton of text isnt actually gameplay. If that describes your own viewpoint, then Sound of Drop  fall into poison- will surprise. Sure, theres not a heavy dose of gameplay akin to Phoenix Wright or something, but what you are offered is tons of choices. At nearly every point in the game you are free to choose between two or more options with how to proceed. Should you interact with and trust a character or look out only for yourself? Should you return to a dangerous area or go forward into a brand new location? This visual novel is absolutely packed with choice  especially when it comes to escaping (or failing to escape) deadly situations. The Manten Aquarium is not a nice place and not every choice leads to a good outcome. In just my first playthrough, I ran headfirst into ten bad ends. Bad ends are exactly what they sound like. You receive an ending to the story, sure, but its entirely unpleasant. The goal for Sound of Drop  fall into poison  players is to achieve one of the four true ends. Each of these offers better prospects for our cast, and prove to be worth the effort required to get there. Its probably impossible to get a true ending right off the bat (unless youre using a guide) as it is hard to always gauge which choices are safe and which lead into more danger. But thats part of the fun! Just be sure to make liberal use of the save slot function to be able to redo a choice after making a completely wrong one.A good, scary experience can exist without great graphics or audio, but its typically strengthened by the presence of these. Luckily, both exist here. The anime art may at first seem similar to other visual novels, but it delves into some disgusting territory. After all, it must depict the horrors of the Manten Aquarium in a way that scares the player. The scariest aspect of all is when the game simply leaves the visuals up to you. Instead of forcing us to view their depictions of scary stuff every single time, players are sometimes allowed to imagine what they will from a text description, which is often all the more frightening. Audio keeps up with tense music that keeps you unknowingly on edge throughout. One low point? Theres no voice acting in Japanese or English to listen to while playing. One playthrough for Sound of Drop  fall into poison- takes around four hours. This is a good length as it allows you to fully delve into the disturbing nature of the Manten Aquarium but doesnt overstay its welcome. It also offers ample opportunities for players to experience some of the 27 bad endings  and feel relief with one of the 4 good ones. Working through other endings would probably be a bit more challenging, however, as the visual novel does not mark off previously made choices on subsequent playthroughs. Beyond that, given how many options there are, it would be hard to chart a path to a new ending without knowing which key choices need to be made which way. Closing Comments: Sound of Drop  fall into poison  is an impressive visual novel for how it manages to utterly disturb players with simple text and anime artwork. Theres no doubt that horror fans will quite enjoy their time with the experience, especially uncovering every single one of the more than thirty endings. The lack of voice acting is a little bit of a letdown, but that is no reason to ignore Sound of Drop  fall into poison . This is one of the top visual novel releases on Steam this year, and an excellent horror experience in general.", "date": "October 30, 2015", "grade": 4.5}
